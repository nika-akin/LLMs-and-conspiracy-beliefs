Two months and over $800K later, he recovers

A 6-year-old boy who didn't receive childhood vaccinations nearly died after contracting tetanus in what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is Oregon's first pediatric case of this kind in decades.

The CDC released a case report Friday, detailing the incident in 2017. While playing outside on a farm, the boy busted his forehead open. The wound was cleaned and stitched at home. Six days later, the boy's muscles were spasming, his jaw clenched and he had trouble breathing. Doctors diagnosed him with tetanus and admitted him to intensive care.

He couldn't open his mouth, continued to spasm and developed hypertension. Doctors gave him a variety of medications to control pain, blood pressure and manage his muscle outbursts.

On day five in the hospital, doctors opened his neck and gave him a tracheostomy so that he could breathe, the report says. He was placed on prolonged ventilator support.

After about 50 days in the hospital, he showed promise: He was able to walk 20 feet with assistance. Days later, he was transferred to a rehab facility.

In total, he was in the hospital for 57 days and his care totaled $811,929, according to the CDC. A month after in-patient rehab, he was able to run again.

But even after contracting a life-threatening infection that might have been prevented by a vaccine, his family stood firm on their anti-vax stance.

""Despite extensive review of the risks and benefits of tetanus vaccination by physicians, the family declined the second dose of DTaP and any other recommended immunizations,"" the case report states.

The DTaP vaccine (for diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough) is effective for 8 to 9 in 10 children who get it, according to the CDC.

His family is part of a small but growing group of adults refusing to vaccinate their children. While the reason behind their decision wasn't made public, some anti-vaxxers cite a discredited belief that vaccines cause autism. Recently, another large-scale study further reinforced that vaccines do not cause autism by looking at any autism connection between the measles vaccine and more than half a million children.

What was the comedian's tweet about Valerie Jarrett and when was her show cancelled? Here's all you need to know.

What was Roseanne Barr's racist Twitter rant about Valerie Jarrett?

Roseanne Barr joked that former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett is a product of the Muslim Brotherhood and the ""Planet of the Apes.""

Barr then apologised to Jarrett on Twitter ""for making a bad joke"" about her politics and her looks.

Meanwhile, comic Wanda Sykes, who is a consulting producer on ""Roseanne"", tweeted that she would not be returning to the show.

Barr's now-deleted tweet read: ""Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = VJ.""

It was a busy day on Twitter for Barr, who also tweeted or re-tweeted attacks on Michael Moore, Chelsea Clinton and George Soros.

In her apology, Barr said the Jarrett comment was ""in bad taste"".

The Roseanne TV show revival this spring was an unexpected major hit for ABC.

Barr apologised again on July 26 for her controversial Twitter comment but insisted she had been misunderstood and said the mistake ""cost me everything"".

ABC cancelled its hit reboot of Roseanne following her racist tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett.

President Channing Dungey said the comment ""is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel the show"".

The show was particularly popular among many conservative viewers because Barr's character expressed support for President Donald Trump."

But when it comes to dealing with the Sept. 11 attacks, the most noteworthy debate is the one going on among people on the left and other people on the left.

In that discussion, some commentators have shown a firm grasp of reality and unapologetic patriotism. Others, however, have been striving mightily to make themselves into national laughingstocks.

There are plenty of conservatives, of course, who have used the opportunity to permanently disqualify themselves from ever being taken seriously again--including Ann Coulter, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. But for sheer volume of imbecility, it's hard to outdo the blame-America-first crowd of mindless peaceniks and twitchy conspiracy theorists. The New Republic, a moderately liberal political weekly, has been running a regular feature called ""Idiocy Watch,"" highlighting particularly lamebrained comments, and the forum has so far been dominated by lefties.

In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorism, writer Susan Sontag found herself barraged with criticism for decrying the ""self-righteous drivel and outright deception being peddled by public figures and TV commentators,"" while assailing our ""cowardly"" approach to war.

Weeks later, her bout of temporary insanity is beginning to look permanent. ""I don't like throwing biscuits and peanut butter and jam and napkins, little snack packages produced in a small city in Texas, so we can say, `Look, we're doing something humanitarian,' "" sneers Sontag in an interview with the online magazine Salon. She fears that the government is about to deport all Muslims and declare martial law, which is about as likely as Susan Sontag being appointed secretary of defense.

Humorist Michael Moore, who made the anti-capitalist movie ""Roger & Me,"" finds reasons to yuk it up. ""Finally, the bombs are raining down on Afghanistan, and as Martha Stewart says, that's a good thing,"" he brays on his Web site. ""Yesiree, I say, BOMBS AWAY! Rockets red glare. We are all WHITE WITH FOAM!"" I don't know about you, but I laughed till my ribs hurt.

Professional moviemaker and amateur paranoid Oliver Stone saw the terrorist attacks as the fault of the Republican Party. ""Does anybody make a connection between the 2000 election and the events of Sept. 11?"" he asked at a recent panel discussion in New York, which I take to mean that the terrorists were bitter that Al Gore didn't win.

Stone searched hard and found something good to say about Osama bin Laden and Co.: ""The new world order is about order and control. This attack was pure chaos, and chaos is energy. All great changes have come from people or events that were initially misunderstood, and seemed frightening, like madmen.""

Does it seem odd to you that Oliver Stone would feel affinity with madmen? Me neither.

Fortunately, you can find plenty of left-of-center commentators who prefer their country and its ideals over those of the enemy. At the New York forum, writer Christopher Hitchens lambasted Stone as a ""moral idiot, as well as an intellectual idiot."" The attack, he said, was ""state-supported mass murder, using civilians as missiles.""

The Nation magazine, perhaps the best-known organ of leftist thought, published a column by Katha Pollitt on why she refused to let her daughter decorate their living-room window with an American flag--which Mom regards as a symbol of ""jingoism and vengeance and war."" (The daughter retorts that the flag ""means standing together and honoring the dead and saying no to terrorism."" Where does she get such ideas?)

But many other Nation contributors have taken a sharply different view from Pollitt's. Writing in the latest issue, Princeton professor Richard Falk agrees with those who fault the U.S. as an imperialist power, but says that critique is ""dangerously inappropriate in addressing the challenge posed by the massive crime against humanity committed on Sept. 11."" The American role in world affairs, he argues, ""cannot be addressed so long as this movement of global terrorism is at large and prepared to carry on with its demonic work.""

Nation columnist Eric Alterman has no charity toward those who feel no patriotism at a time like this. Some of them, he says, ""really do hate their country. These leftists find nothing to admire in its magnificent Constitution; its fitful history of struggle toward greater freedom for women, minorities and other historically oppressed groups; and its values, however imperfectly or hypocritically manifested in everyday life."" For Alterman, ""patriotism requires no apologies.""

Those who feel differently--who can't take their own country's side when it is under attack by murderous foreign theocrats--should find themselves disgraced and ignored long after this struggle is over. In wartime, as leftists like Alterman understand, stupidity is not forgivable."

We who believe in peace in the world must get behind a strong United Nations to convince the US that their actions and foreign policies are destroying the world. I have lost complete respect for their sanity. I say this as a 61-year-old female nana of four from Canada. The suffering of women and children all over the world and their looks of pain are never far from my mind. The backroom dealings with a bunch of rich, old men seem to be dictating the fate of so many innocent people who deserve to live their lives too. - Sherry Smith

The US is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in Somalia, or any other country for that matter, that is harboring terrorists. These people are responsible for killing American citizens, as well as many other people from all over the world. We cannot let these people get away with these crimes. The entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists, Europe included. If the world does not stand up now, we will have a much, much bigger problem in the years to come. No one stood up to Hitler until it was too late, we can't afford to do the same thing again. - Richard Mattis

Pre-emptive strikes that kill innocent civilians and destabilize economies only encourage more people to believe violence and terror are solutions. Many in the US find President Bush's foreign policy deplorable. - Dorothea Izzo

While I am not confident of the overall wisdom of launching these attacks, I've no doubt that those on the receiving end of the attacks richly deserve them. - Tom

The US gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism. Terrorists are killing defenseless men, women, children and our freedom. How do you bring terrorists in for peace talks? Let history speak for itself. Europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns, killing civilians indiscriminately. We do not want to see history repeat itself, therefore we will stop them when and where ever we find them. In doing so, we may succeed in saving lives here and abroad. - Frank Penna

My friends in Germany, wake up and smell the jihad. Just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country, reeling from a century of warfare, and understandably wishing for peace in this world, being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat. These are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the Middle East, Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, England, Spain, Thailand, and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet. Eradicating these people, especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders, as was done in Somalia just now, is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace. Somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical Islamic threat. Only a fool loves war, but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him. Godspeed to the Ethiopian army. More civilized nations, especially the ""blind mice"" of Europe, had better come on board before it's too late. Germany: you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason. - Ron Jendry

I believe it was the Islamist and warlords that destabilized Somalia, not the USA, which killed a known terrorist, one that could have easily struck any of the EU embassies or nations. I believe that the EU has lost perspective here and that it is easier for the EU to criticize than it is to take action or stand by a known ally. - J. Becher"

Former President Barack Obama had a message for wealthy Democratic donors on Thursday evening growing anxious about the current slate of primary candidates and the lack of a clear frontrunner in the race.

""Everybody needs to chill out about the candidates but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind whoever emerges from this process,"" Obama said at a California fundraiser, according to a report in The Washington Post.

The former president also said that Democrats should avoid putting candidates through ""purity tests,"" according to The New York Times.

""I'm always suspicious of purity tests during elections,"" Obama said. ""Because you know what? The country's complicated.""

He also urged the party to focus on defeating President Donald Trump in next year's election and not get sucked into ideological disputes that could threaten their chances of reclaiming the White House.

""The field will narrow, and there's going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don't agree with and you don't find them completely inspiring the way you'd like, I don't care,"" Obama said. ""Because the choice is so stark and the stakes are so high that you cannot afford to be ambivalent in this race.""

They're the latest attention-grabbing comments from Obama, who has been moving off the sidelines in the Democratic primary to soothe the nerves of party donors and lawmakers. Some are rattled by the progressive ideas driving the primary like Medicare for All and the wealth tax.

Last week, Obama indirectly rebuked Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both leading progressive candidates, saying that ""the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.""

Obama, however, has not endorsed a candidate, and only offered guidance to those seeking his counsel, The Times reported. The former president has declined to call out candidates by name up to now and hasn't tried to tilt the scales behind the scenes either.

He's chosen instead to push his big tent, moderate vision of politics, fearful that sweeping ideas to remake the American economic and healthcare systems could alienate swing voters in the general election."

Congress finally got to see the report last week, which contains a letter from then-CIA Director George Tenet.

The document says: “While in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government."" It also claims the inquiry required information ""indicating that Saudi Government officials in the United States may have other ties to al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups.” However, the commission that authored the document acknowledged that much of the info ""remains speculative and yet to be independently verified.""

Saudi Ambassador to the United States Abdullah Al-Saud put out a statement after the document's release Friday welcoming its publication. He said: ""Several government agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, have investigated the contents of the '28 Pages' and have confirmed that neither the Saudi government, nor senior Saudi officials, nor any person acting on behalf of the Saudi government provided any support or encouragement for these attacks. ""We hope the release of these pages will clear up, once and for all, any lingering questions or suspicions about Saudi Arabia's actions, intentions, or long-term friendship with the United States.""

The report suggests the connections could point towards ""incontrovertible evidence that there is support for these terrorists within the Saudi Government”. Authors of the report insist no final determinations have been made over whether the information is correct, stating further investigation may reveal genuine reasons which explain the links. The report also reveals flaws in the intelligence-sharing system in the US government. One case was highlighted during which a CIA memorandum ""which discusses alleged financial connections between the September 11 hijackers, Saudi Government officials, and members of the Saudi Royal Family"" was placed into an FBI case file and never forwarded to FBI headquarters until the memo was discovered by the inquiry.

The report said: “Prior to September 11, the FBI apparently did not focus investigative resources on [redacted] Saudi nationals in the United States due to Saudi Arabia's status as an American 'ally.'"" It also reveals some officials in the Saudi Government were ""uncooperative"" in counterterrorism investigations before and after 9/11. In one case the report states the Saudis have not provided information on Saudi nationals despite providing copies of the subjects' Saudi passports. The report said: ""A number of FBI agents and CIA officers complained to the Joint Inquiry about a lack of Saudi cooperation in terrorism investigations both before and after the September 11 attacks.""

President Barack Obama said in April his administration would declassify the 28 pages because of pressure from families and lawmakers. Sources told CNN ahead of the report's release that intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the State Department had all reviewed and approved the release of the pages with ""minimal redactions.""But the report Congress put out had multiple inked-out sections. Still, the release of the pages on Friday was welcomed by New York Senator Charles Schumer, who has co-sponsored a bill that opens the door for families of 9/11 victims to sue foreign states and financial partners of terrorism.

He told reporters in New York: ”Preliminary readings show that there may well have been Saudi involvement in the terror of 9/11 both in the Saudi government and within the Saudi country, within Saudi Arabia. ""The families who I have fought for long and hard now will be able to go to court, and soon, and if the Saudi government was complicit in 9/11 they should pay the price to the families who deserve justice. ""And they should pay the price so no other government will think of playing footsie with terrorists the way the Saudi government may well have done in 2001."""

Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, chairman of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication, University of Cambridge, said he remembered being sent to play with children with measles and chickenpox before vaccines for these were introduced.

Speaking at a Science Media Centre briefing, the statistician said parents may have to think about doing the same for Covid-19 if a vaccine doesn’t get discovered.

Sir David, 66, said: “I remember this pre-vaccination era, as a kid I was sent around to go and play with friends, who had measles, mumps, chickenpox... the lot.

“I’m not suggesting this is the public health solution but if no vaccine comes along, you might think that way.”

‘Pox-parties’ were popular in the pre-vaccine era when parents believed a disease was less severe in childhood or wanted to “get it over with.”

Medics at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health warn children should never be deliberately exposed to infections.

Speaking at the same briefing, Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, agreed that society will need to have ""rational debates"" about when is the least risky age to be infected with coronavirus.

""So, if you took away the concept (of a vaccine), let's park that aside, and this becomes a circulating endemic infection, we will start to have to have a debate around when is it better to get this infection?

""If you look at the data, it is when you're under 45. As you get older, then it's worse for you.""

Scientists claim data shows that children are more likely to be struck by lightning than die of coronavirus.

Some studies show that children suffer less severe coronavirus symptoms and are less likely to die from it. They are also thought to be less effective at spreading it.

The UK's coronavirus death toll yesterday rose to 40,883, up by 286 from 40,597 on Monday June 8."

His pronouncement that the country’s current lack of water is part of a plot by Western countries has caused much amusement in some quarters.

There is no doubt that Iran is suffering from a lack of water. Three quarters of the country is drought-affected and duststorms are a frequent occurrence. Critics of Ahmadinejad’s government claim that the shortage of drinking water is the result of mismanagement of water distribution system and some two-thirds of available water is lost through wastage.

The President, however, is pointing a finger at the West. To be fair, this is a message he was issuing as early as May this year. So could there be an element of truth in his claims?

Although Mr Ahmadinejad is the son of a blacksmith, he was, until his appointment as Major of Tehran, a lecturer at the city’s University of Science and Technology, holding a PhD in traffic and transport. So he does have enough of a background in science to make his comments worthy of consideration.

Weather modification does have a long history. As early as 1947 the U.S. military was attempting to divert the course of hurricanes by seeding clouds with silver iodide. At the same time, the British were attempting to keep runways at military airfields clear by the use of long lines of burners, with the view to clearing any thick fog which had formed.

As recently as 2009, Chinese meteorologists claimed to have brought about Beijing’s earliest snowfall in a decade after seeding clouds with silver iodide in an attempt to end the ongoing drought. The resultant disruption to road and rail transport suggests that snow was probably not the objective of the experiment – a good soaking of rain was what they were really hoping for.

The problem with weather modification is whether it can be proved that the weather was indeed modified or whether it had occurred naturally.

It is likely that Mr Ahmadinejad was specifically referring to the use of electromagnetic waves to control weather. Quoted at the opening of a dam in the central province of Arak, he told reporters, “According to reports about climate, whose authenticity has been verified, the European countries have used certain equipment to discharge clouds and prevent rain-bearing clouds from reaching regional countries such as Iran.” 

The ‘certain equipment’ to which he refers is probably that known as ‘atmospheric resonance technology’. This technology has a history stretching back to the work of Nikola Tesla in the late nineteen century. Tesla carried out experiments involving electromagnetic flux and the earth’s gravitational field.

Reports of experiments to use this technology for the modification of weather patterns can be traced back to the early 1990s and HAARP - High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program – an ionispheric research programme. In addition to the intended target of improved radio communications and surveillance, it has been postulated that such a programme could be used to alter weather patterns – an idea which has appealed to military strategists for many decades. But evidence that such schemes have been put into place is limited.

More recently, some relatively small-scale commercial operations have claimed to have ‘lassoed’ passing weather systems using methods based on electromagnetism to deliver rain to fee-paying customers.

For those concerned, like Mr Ahmadinejad, then a word of caution is required: such technology is much loved by internet conspiracy theorists. Similarly, an internet engine search for ‘chemtrails’ will lead the gullible to the belief that our every thought is being controlled by chemicals released from high-flying aircraft – although by whom is never made clear.

The uncertainty of weather does not sit well with our desire for ordered and controlled lives. Attempts to control our weather are likely to increase and there is every chance that they will meet with greater success in the future. But for the time-being, explanations for water shortages are more likely to be of a more mundane nature – such as leaky pipes, Mr Ahmadinejad."

Relaxation of the UK’s quarantine rules and travel advice will not now come until the week after next, Downing Street signalled, as it announced a new traffic-light system that will open up routes to popular destinations like France and Spain.

Critics of the blanket quarantine policy have accused the government of a U-turn and are asking why a targeted approach was not used from the start.

Current government measures are preventing all but a handful of holidaymakers going abroad. For the past 100 days, the Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel anywhere abroad, which mean travel firms cannot send package holidaymaker overseas. Any traveller ignoring the warning is likely to find their insurance is void.

The quarantine rules brought in on 8 June mean they will face two weeks of mandatory self-isolation on their return to the UK – just as incoming tourists and business travellers do. The measures have already triggered the cancellation of millions of trips and stifled new outbound and inbound bookings.

Millions more holidaymakers are uncertain whether their summer plans can go ahead, while hundreds of thousands of travel industry staff face an uncertain future.

A spokesperson for British Airways’ parent company, IAG, said: “The impact on the aviation industry and jobs is devastating. Europe is opening up and the UK will be left behind.”

The government has moved away from talk of “air bridge” deals with individual countries. Instead, the Joint Biosecurity Centre – which was set up to coordinate the government’s response to the pandemic – is categorising countries with a “traffic light” system.

Each country is rated green, amber or red, depending on the prevalence of coronavirus, the trajectory of disease and the centre’s assessment of the data’s reliability. Quarantine will apply only to nations rated red.

Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe, will expect to be rated green or amber, with quarantine reserved for locations with records similar to, or worse than, the UK.

The government has already signalled that travellers from France, Spain and Greece will be exempt.

A senior source said the change “will allow those who need to travel for work to do so without the need to self-isolate on their return”.

The mention of “work” indicates that a wide range of business destinations, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, are likely to be quarantine-free.

All inbound travellers will still be required to complete a passenger locator form in order to enter the UK, so they can be traced if necessary.

A government spokesperson said: “Our public health measures at the border were put in place to manage the risk of imported cases and help prevent a second wave of the virus, and will continue to support our fight against coronavirus.

“Our new risk-assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world – giving people the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad and boosting the UK economy through tourism and business.

“But we will not hesitate to put on the brakes if any risks re-emerge, and this system will enable us to take swift action to re-introduce self-isolation measures if new outbreaks occur overseas.”

Separately, a senior Foreign Office source confirmed that the blanket no-go ban will be eased “in countries and territories where the public health risk is no longer unacceptably high”.

The source said: “Implementation of the exemptions will be set out next week, likely beginning on 6 July.”

It is presumed that on the same date, the quarantine rules will be lifted for travellers from “safe” countries.

The quarantine policy must be reviewed on Monday, 29 June. On Wednesday the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, indicated to MPs that a list of countries from which travellers may avoid quarantine would be published on that day.

It was understood that the Foreign Office would lift its blanket no-go advice at the same time.

But the government is now thought likely to delay an announcement until Wednesday, 1 July, with the eased restrictions taking effect from the following week.

The news that certainty about summer plans could be delayed still further has infuriated senior figures in Britain’s travel industry, which is severely weakened because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“We are beyond frustrated,” said a senior executive from a giant travel firm. “We want to take people on holiday and the government won’t let us.”

A spokesperson for Abta, the travel association, said: “The travel sector remains in a perilous state, with redundancies announced each week.

“We need a more comprehensive roadmap as soon as possible that includes time frames for relaxing international travel restrictions too so businesses and customers can plan ahead.

“The process of sending people on holiday is not like turning on a tap; as much advance notice as possible from the government is required for travel companies to restart operations.”

Paul Charles, spokesperson for the Quash Quarantine group, said: “The government has continued to ensure the travel sector is flying through fog.

“There is no visibility over when the industry can take bookings without any risk attached. Consumers are unable to book with confidence.”

Most European Union countries will lift restrictions on incoming tourists from elsewhere in Europe on 1 July."

Pioneering whistleblower laws were passed by the Continental Congress in 1778, and by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, at the height of the Civil War.

Who should be TIME’s Person of the Year for 2019? Cast your vote in the reader poll.

But as important and effective as whistleblowing has become today, its rise is actually bad news for American society in the long term– a symptom of the breakdown of internal checks and balances on our corporations and our government. This current spate of high-level disclosures by whistleblowers coincides with the spread of cultures of secrecy, of outsourcing public goods and services to private contractors, of increasing normalization of conflict of interest and other unethical practices as clever business models, and the weakening of the very concept of public service itself. Watchdogs are disappearing, as regulators are captured, defunded or drowned out by lobbying, as local newspapers cut their staffs, and with fewer attorneys at the Department of Justice willing or able to prosecute white collar criminals. Corporate and government insiders realize that if they don’t speak out, no one will ever learn of the wrongdoing they see.

We publicly celebrate whistleblowers in the news and in films as heroes, but in real life we allow most of them to be permanently blackballed in their chosen fields. This two-faced view toward people with the rare courage to speak truth to power suggests why whistleblowing is so alarmingly easy to politicize. And since the basic currency of whistleblowing is a respect for facts and the rule of law, the act of whistleblowing, like democracy itself, is at hazard in today’s postfact world.

Creating vaccines for new diseases generally take several years -- if they work at all.

“I said by the end of the year, I think it will be a lot sooner than that,” he said Friday, and called development of a vaccine in record time “easy.”

In a nearly hour-long speech in the Rose Garden, Trump jumped from the economy to protests against police violence to the ongoing pandemic, praising those states that have moved quickly to reopen their economies and criticizing those that have kept public health measures in place. He spoke of great progress against the virus, even as cases rise in many states.

“We want the lockdown to end for the states,” he said. “We may have some embers or some ashes or flames [of coronavirus] coming, but we will put them out, we will stomp them out.”

He also inaccurately claimed that the U.S. leads the world in coronavirus cases because it leads the world in testing. While improved testing rates have found more cases, there would be even more cases without ramped up testing as asymptomatic carriers would unknowningly spread the virus.

Trump spoke Friday with top administration officials packed tightly around him, none of them wearing masks. And just before the event began, the White House moved reporters' chairs to be much closer together than the six feet of distance recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.

""I notice you’re starting to get much closer together — looks much better I must say,"" he said.

Economic advisers and officials flanked Trump and no health official spoke at the event.

But while the president spoke, CDC Director Robert Redfield tweeted that the coronavirus is “the most significant public health challenge to face our Nation in more than a century.”

“It is weaving its way through our social consciousness, our outward expression, and our grief,” Redfield wrote.

The U.S. currently has 1.88 million confirmed cases and 108,664 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center."

WASHINGTON — A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund the president’s health care law.

The ruling from US District Judge Rosemary Collyer is a win for House Republicans who brought the politically charged legal challenge in an effort to undermine the law.

At stake is $175 billion the government is paying over a decade to reimburse health insurers for reducing copayments for lower-income people.

The House argued that Congress never specifically appropriated that money and has denied the administration’s request for it. It says the administration is spending the money anyway, exceeding its constitutional authority. The administration has said it is using other, previously approved money.

Collyer issued an order stopping further reimbursements, but said it would not take effect pending an appeal.

House Republicans authorized the lawsuit in 2014 over Democratic objections. The House had already voted dozens of times to repeal all or parts of the law known as “Obamacare,” but most of those efforts went nowhere in the Senate and with President Barack Obama in the White House.

The disputed subsidies help lower-earning people afford out-of-pocket costs such as annual insurance deductibles and copayments when they visit doctors.

The White House had earlier argued that the House had no legal authority to pursue its lawsuit, but Collyer rejected that argument and allowed the case to proceed.

The administration is expected to appeal Thursday’s ruling to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

The 51-year-old was forced to interrupt 'Susan from London' as she suddenly veered off topic during a phone-in about if it was 'wrong' to urge women to take more care if themselves to avoid getting attacked.

Speaking to Susan on line 4, her point started out calmly, stating that she finds it ""inflammatory"" that rape is seen as a female issue rather than it needing to educate young men and boys about correct behaviour.

She said: ""We miss out what young boys need, their education.""

So far so good, but then she tried to add in something else that is troubling her at the moment.

Susan said: ""We also have a another problem,"" before launching to what could have been an epic rant.

She raged: ""We have an amazing amount of white lines in the sky which are chemtrails and I am so sick and tired of looking at them and no one in this country...""

Realising what was happening, Matthew swept in, cutting her off and chastising her on air.

He said: ""Susan, Susan, Susan we're talking about something really seriously and I think you owe to people who've been raped - and as a woman - to stick to the theme.""

While it's a relatively underground belief, the idea behind the chemtrails theory is that the Government and other shady organisations fill the sky with chemical or biological agents designed to placate the masses below.

The Telegraph claim that, ""The trails which arouse the most suspicion are those that remain visible for a long time, dispersing into cirrus-like cloud formations, or those from multiple aircraft which form a persistent noughts-and-crosses-style grid over a large area.""

The paper also explain some of the theories used to explain the lingering white stripes, claiming that ""It is an attempt to control global warming, according to some, while others cite far more sinister goals, such as human population control, psychological manipulation, and military weapons testing.

""The trails, it is claimed, are to blame for health problems and respiratory illness.""

AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The photo has been altered. The woman’s sign said, “Give me liberty or give me death.”

THE FACTS: Social media users are sharing an altered photo of a woman holding a sign at a protest against California stay-at-home orders earlier this month.

The images are identical except for the sign carried by the woman, who is wearing an American flag tank top, hat and sunglasses. In the manipulated photo the woman’s sign spells out the full name of former President Barack Obama, placing a tally of the number of letters contained in each part of his name.

An online conspiracy theory movement called QAnon often uses numbers associated with significant dates or the numbers of letters corresponding to a person’s name to promote baseless claims of an attempted coup on President Donald Trump’s presidency. In this case, the numbers seemed to be an effort to tie Obama to COVID-19 although the number of letters in his name only equals 18.

Social media users posted the doctored image with comments mocking the woman for the math error and promoting a QAnon conspiracy theory with her sign.

The original photo was taken during a protest in Huntington Beach, California, by Jeff Gritchen, a staff photographer for the Orange County Register. In the image, the sign says simply: “Give me liberty or give me death,” a famous quote from Patrick Henry’s speech at the Virginia convention in 1775.

In an email, Gritchen confirmed the image had been edited and said he had seen the altered photo “getting a lot of traction online.”

This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform."

The ban follows a review of the accounts, fan pages and groups affiliated with these individuals that they had previously posted, along with their activities outside Facebook. It includes Jones’ show Infowars, which gained notoriety and drew lawsuits for falsely claiming, among other things, that the 2012 massacre of 20 children and six adults at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School never happened.

Yiannopoulos, who was banned from Twitter in 2016 for a campaign of racial harassment against Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones, has been accused of being an apologist for white supremacists and pedophiles. He has repeatedly denied the accusations.

Farrakhan has been dogged for decades over accusations that he’s anti-semitic. In this year alone, the Nation of Islam leader called Jews ""termites"" and ""liars, cheaters and thieves"" and called the religion ""dirty.""

White supremacist leader Paul Nehlen, right-wing British YouTube personality Paul Joseph Watson and Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, were also banned by Facebook, the largest social network. The company won't restrict others provided they abide by the site's rules, it said.

“We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,” the company said in a statement. “The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive, and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.”

Besides his odious views about Sandy Hook, Jones hosted Gavin McInnes, founder of the violent far-right group The Proud Boys, whom Facebook has designated as a hate figure. The Southern Poverty Law Center considers the Proud Boys to be a hate group. McInnes, who has said he has quit the Proud Boys, has sued the SPLC for defamation.

McInness also has ties with Yiannopoulos and Loomer. Yiannopoulos publicly praised him this year, along with Tommy Robinson, a U.K. far-right activist, whom Facebook considers to be a hate figure. Loomer appeared with Robinson and Canadian Faith Gooly, who has been banned from Facebook, last year.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, Facebook as a private company has the right to remove offensive speech from its sites. Indeed, threats and incitements to violence aren’t protected by the First Amendment. Even so, the civil rights group is worried about the long-term ramifications of the social network's decision.

“In its attempts to police the speech of over two billion people, Facebook runs the risk of censoring those that attack white nationalism, too,"" Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, said in an interview with NPR. ""Further, every time Facebook makes the choice to remove content, a single company is exercising an unchecked power to silence individuals and remove them from what has become an indispensable platform.""

Unfortunately, Facebook and other platforms also have the power to censor content on controversial topics like climate change and abortion rights.

""For the same reason that the Constitution prevents the government from exercising such power, we should be wary of encouraging its exercise by corporations that are answerable to their private shareholders rather than the broader public interest,"" Eidelman said."

Later, the contrail loses its easily recognizable line shape and becomes a wispy cirrus cloud. Here, in a photo taken in 1970, new contrails stream behind the wings of a B-52 bomber and the smaller X-24A plane below it.

Contrails appear in the sky as workers leave the Launch Control Center after the launch of the space shuttle Discovery in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Monday April 5, 2010.

These widespread contrails over the southwestern United States were captured by a satellite on Jan. 29, 2004. The crisscrossing white lines are contrails that form from planes flying in different directions at different altitudes. Each contrail spreads and moves with the wind.

This digital photograph taken through the windows of the International Space Station on May 15, 2002, shows contrails over the Rhône Valley in the region west of Lyon, France. These condensation trails begin as thin lines, then spread, forming cirrus clouds.

Like natural clouds, contrail cirrus cloud can trap long-wave radiation and so warm the Earth. A new study calculates that they trap more energy than any other aspect of air travel, including carbon dioxide emissions. However, the carbon dioxide remains in the air for much longer.

Two contrails streak toward the horizon at Carinthia, Austria, in January 2003. Contrails can last for anywhere from a few hours to days depending on the moisture content of the air.

Senior Senate Democratic aides said details were still being worked out, but votes could come by next week on whether to approve the new money.

In February, President Barack Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funds, but Republicans balked, with some arguing that $1.1 billion is more in line with what is needed. Many Republicans also want any Zika funds to be offset with spending cuts elsewhere.

These are among the details that still have to be worked out, according to aides.

Republican Senator Roy Blunt from Missouri and Democratic Senator Patty Murray from Washington, the two senior senators on an appropriations panel that oversees healthcare spending, have been trying to hammer out a deal.

An aide to Murray said in a statement: “Senator Murray is having conversations with Chairman Blunt and others about the path forward on emergency funding to respond to Zika.”

The aide said Murray still supports Obama’s $1.9 billion request.

Amid congressional inaction, the Obama administration shifted $589 million to help federal agencies prepare for Zika. Most of that money came from a fund to fight the Ebola virus and will have to be replenished, according to officials.

Senator Marco Rubio, however, is one Republican pushing for both immediate, emergency funding and longer-term money to be made available starting on Oct. 1 to battle the disease that can cause severe brain deformities in babies born of infected mothers and other illnesses.

“This is going to be an ongoing issue beyond this year,” Rubio said, adding, “We need to jump on it now.”

There are fears that Rubio’s home state of Florida could be the first place in the continental United States to get hit hard by Zika because of its tropical climate.

“For the first time, I’ve seen high-level conversations about a way forward here in the Senate and that’s a positive development,” Rubio said in a brief hallway interview with Reuters.

Republicans in the House of Representatives are still deeply divided over new funding for Zika, according to two senior aides."

The four-day bombing campaign by the United States and Great Britain, code-named Operation Desert Fox struck military targets throughout the country.

Clinton administration officials said the aim of the mission was to “degrade” Iraq’s ability to manufacture and use weapons of mass destruction, not to eliminate it. When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked about the distinction while the operation was going on, she responded: ""I don't think we're pretending that we can get everything, so this is — I think — we are being very honest about what our ability is. We are lessening, degrading his ability to use this. The weapons of mass destruction are the threat of the future.”

While the bombing was ongoing, the Vanguards of Conquest, a terrorist group, issued a communique to fellow Islamist groups calling for attacks against the United States “for its arrogance” in bombing Iraq.

Some Republican members of Congress accused Clinton of using the airstrikes to divert attention from ongoing impeachment proceedings that had been lodged against him. (The day before the strikes took place, the Republican-led House issued a report accusing Clinton of committing “high crimes and misdemeanors,” related to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. The charges centered on a sexual liaison in the Oval Office with an intern that Clinton at first falsely denied had taken place.)

Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the GOP majority leader, called the airstrikes’ timing “suspect” and “cursory."" Branding the strikes as a ploy to direct attention away from the congressional impeachment initiative, Republicans also predicted that the air attacks would ultimately prove futile in persuading Hussein to comply with the U.N.’s demands. The GOP took the view that only sustained bombardment of Iraq and the direct overthrow of Saddam's dictatorship could put a stop to Iraq’s purported clandestine weapons program.

Clinton, however, in a televised address to the nation on this day, brushed aside Republican criticism. He declared that the Iraqi president was wrong if he thought “the serious debate [on impeachment] would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to face him down.” The president stressed that his decision to launch airstrikes remained critical to America’s vital interests.

Ultimately, public and media attention focused on Clinton’s battle to save his presidency and to avoid being found guilty in an all-but-certain Senate trial. (The Senate acquitted him in February 1999.) Meantime, the strikes failed to intimidate Saddam into allowing weapons inspectors unfettered access to his alleged chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction. Saddam's stance ultimately led George W. Bush, Clinton’s successor, to order an American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 — with consequences that are evident to the present day."

With less than an hour to shake hands on an agreement, Democrats and Republicans averted a crisis by sanctioning a deal that allows the wheels of federal government to tick over for the next five days. Once they elapse, the political skirmishes are expected to erupt into full-scale war. Commentators say the tense talks of recent days are only a dress rehearsal for the clashes that threaten the social reforms Barack Obama has made the main plank of his presidency. The President appeared buoyant after yesterday’s deal, declaring: “The government will be open for business. “Both parties reached an agreement that will allow our small businesses to get the loans they need, our families to get the mortgages they applied for and hundreds of thousands of Americans to show up at work and take home their pay cheques on time.”

Mr Obama had cancelled a weekend with his family to oversee the tense talks that ended with the fund extension. While Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hailed the agreement as “historic”, John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, vowed that over the next decade they would cut government spending by £300billion. For the past six days the two had overseen the behind-closed-door talks under the threat of a national shutdown that would wreck the country’s economic recovery by putting up to 800,000 government employees out of work. The threat still lingers. With America needing to trim its £2trillion budget to avoid a debt default that would upset Wall Street and the financial markets, the question of budget management still haunts Mr Obama and his dreams of a second term in the White House.

The last president to witness a federal shutdown was Bill Clinton, who outfoxed Republican speaker Newt Gingrich in 1996 after a three-week budget crisis.Refusing to cut a deal over cuts that would have had hampered his health care programme, Mr Clinton famously faced his opponent like an old-fashioned gunslinger. In a stand-off in the Oval Office, the President pointed to the chair behind his desk and warned: “If you want to pass your budget, you’re going to have to put somebody else in this chair.” Described as Mr Clinton’s “Gary Cooper moment”, it saw his popularity rocket and carry him to a second term victory. Democrats are expecting the same steely nerves from Obama over months as America continues to polarise over issues such as health care and assistance for the poor and elderly.

Yesterday’s deal saw the Republican’s original attempts to cut £200million from the federal Planned Parenthood programme flounder. The scheme, which offers inexpensive abortions and family planning, is anathema to right-wingers. Yet as their influence grows, as well as the rise of the conservative Tea Party, spending on what are perceived as socialist ideals is likely to cause near warfare between the Democrats, who hold the Senate majority, and the Republicans, who control the House of Representatives. Over the coming months, as Mr Obama’s administration reaches the limits of its borrowing levels, he will need support from both sides. An increase of £600billion is needed to keep the government running until the autumn, say financial analysts, while keeping it going until next year’s presidential election will need £1.2trillion."

Somalis are just the latest example of a tight-knit community in which the highly contagious disease has gained a foothold in the U.S. Similar outbreaks have affected Orthodox Jews and the Amish in recent years.

Medical professionals and state health officials are working to contain the virus, but they expect more people to fall ill in coming weeks. A look at the situation:

Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but as of Tuesday, 34 cases were confirmed in Minnesota. It's the largest outbreak in the state since 1990, when 460 people contracted measles and three died.

Nearly everyone infected is unvaccinated, and all but a few are of Somali descent. So far, 11 children have been hospitalized.

The source of the outbreak is unknown, said Kris Ehresmann, infectious disease director with the state Department of Health.

Nine other states have seen measles cases so far this year, but none has reported an outbreak of Minnesota's magnitude, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Somali children are getting sick because the community has a low rate of immunization for measles, mumps and rubella, Ehresmann said. Unvaccinated children from other communities are also at risk.

According to the Health Department, 42 percent of Minnesota-born Somali toddlers had received the MMR vaccine as of 2017, compared with 88 percent of non-Somali toddlers.

But the rate for vaccination was not always that low. In 2004, 92 percent of Somali toddlers had the MMR vaccine. The community's immunization rate fell sharply to 70 percent in 2008 as some people raised concern about a perceived greater prevalence of autism among Somali children.

A University of Minnesota study that examined 7- to 9-year-olds in Minneapolis in 2010 found no statistical difference between the rate of autism among Somali children and white children, Ehresmann said.

Minnesota law requires that a child be vaccinated before enrolling in child care, early education programs or school. But it also allows exemptions for medical reasons or ""conscientiously held beliefs.""

A 2014 study by the American Board of Family Medicine found 35 percent of Somali parents surveyed believed the measles vaccine causes autism, compared with 8 percent of non-Somali parents.

Research that links the vaccine to autism has been widely discredited. But Anab Gulaid, a University of Minnesota researcher who worked on the autism study, said autism is often diagnosed in children around the same age as they receive their measles vaccine, so some the fears persist.

""It's an emotional issue for people,"" she said.

Other communities with low vaccination rates have also been affected by measles in recent years. Nearly 20 people in the Orthodox Jewish community in Los Angeles were sickened by measles in December. Fifty-eight were sickened in 2013 when the measles swept through Orthodox Jewish communities in New York.

In Ohio, 360 people got the measles in 2014 after unvaccinated Amish travelers visited the Philippines and brought the disease home.

Minnesota health officials say they would like to see at least 95 percent of the population immunized to protect everyone from measles, a highly-contagious disease that can cause respiratory problems, brain swelling, or death.

Dozens of Somali parents attended a recent meeting organized by groups that believe there's a link between vaccines and autism or other injuries. Some in attendance said they would rather face measles, or a child's death, than a lifetime of autism.

Patti Carroll, with the Vaccine Safety Council of Minnesota, said the goal of the meeting was to empower parents.

""We did a presentation that helped the Somalis put the measles and the MMR vaccine into perspective,"" Carroll said. ""It's their right to say no.""

Sophia Mohamed, a New Brighton mother of two who believes her 16-year-old son got autism after receiving the MMR vaccine as a toddler, said public officials need to listen to parents like her.

""We are not against the vaccine, but we want a safe vaccine,"" Mohamed said. ""We have a choice ... I don't need any researcher to tell me. I know. I saw the results.""

Evidence-based research has repeatedly shown no relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism, and there should be no hesitations about vaccines, said Patsy Stinchfield, senior director of infection control at Children's Minnesota hospital.

""In medical science, there is no debate about the safety of vaccines,"" she said.

Stinchfield worked at the hospital during the 1990 outbreak and recalls when an entire hospital floor had to be turned into a measles ward. Two of the three people who died that year were children at the hospital.

The hospital has taken extra precautions.

On Tuesday, two workers sat at a desk outside the clinic's main lobby, assessing all patients who entered for potential measles risks. A negative air filter ran in the background, sucking away contaminated air, while all the clinic's tiniest patients and parents were told to wear masks.

Anyone with symptoms of measles is ushered in through a back door, away from the main lobby.

Amira Hassan, 4, came for a wellness check Tuesday and wore a mask in the waiting room. Her father, Mohamud Hassan, said she's been vaccinated for measles, and he doesn't refuse a vaccine if a doctor says it's OK.

Hassan, who is Somali, said rumors about vaccines persist, but it's best to ask a doctor or someone who knows. He chose vaccination, saying: ""If your child is going to school, you don't want other kids to be affected too.""

Here is an example used in everyday language from CNN.com on Feb. 6, 2002: ""Maybe there was no proof before, but there is now; a secret memo — personally handed to U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney by Ken Lay ex-Enron chairman and CEO, which helps explain why the White House is so skittish about Enron and why Cheney and U.S. President George W. Bush stubbornly refuse to release the records of those energy task force meetings. The memo was obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle and reported exclusively there last week. This is the Enron smoking gun.""

The phrase ""smoking gun"" calls up the image of a killer holding a gun that has just been fired as he stands over the dead body. The origins of the phrase seem to date to the short story ""The Gloria Scott,"" which was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and featured Sherlock Holmes. In the story, Doyle states, ""The chaplain stood with the smoking pistol in his hand.""

The phrase came into prominence in public conversation during the Watergate scandal of the 1970s. In June 1972, then-President Richard Nixon had a conversation in the White House with his aide H.R. Haldeman. In this conversation, he ordered Haldeman to get the FBI to cease investigating the Watergate break-in, coming up with various excuses to use for the order. The conversation was taped. When the existence and content of the audio tape came to light in 1974, it revealed that Nixon had himself been involved in the Watergate cover up and had obstructed justice. This tape was referred to widely as the ""smoking gun"" tape. In fact, the House Judiciary Committee investigating had already been asking ""Where's the smoking gun?"" in its efforts to link Nixon to the initial Watergate break-in and the subsequent cover up.

The phrase was widely revived in 2003 in the search for the weapons of mass destruction that some claimed were being manufactured in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Teams searching for incontrovertible evidence that these weapons existed were said to be looking for the ""smoking gun."" U.N. officials and reporters all used the term with this very specific meaning.

The term ""smoking gun"" has also migrated over to the field of science in recent years. In 2014, a discovery of gravitational waves combined with a new theory regarding the rapid inflation of the universe at its beginnings were roundly cited as the ""smoking gun"" providing the validity of the Big Bang theory."

But a lawyer for Jones recently said the conspiracy theorist is merely playing a character when he speaks via his InfoWars channels. “He’s playing a character,” attorney Randall Wilhite said during a recent pretrial hearing. “He is a performance artist.”

The Austin reports Jones is in the middle of a custody battle, and his ex-wife and mother of his three children, Kelly Jones, has said his fiery rants prove he is not a fit parent. “He’s not a stable person,” Kelly Jones has said, according to the Statesman. “He broadcasts from home. The children are there, watching him broadcast.”

A jury will soon weigh in on whether or not there is a separation between the alleged performance artist and the father of three.

Jones has become an unlikely force in the Donald Trump era. Among his millions of listeners is the President himself, who told Jones his “reputation is amazing” when he appeared on his show during the 2016 primary season.

A number of conspiracy theories peddled by the President, too, appear to have either stemmed from something Jones said or taken off because they were mentioned on the show, including the false notion that former President Barack Obama founded ISIS or that the election was “rigged.”

Jones has said he remains in regular contact with the President, and even recently turned down a trip to the Mar-A-Lago estate, the reports. A Texas judge will allow attorneys to play a selection of Jones’ InfoWars clips during the custody trial."

Thanks to a recent billion-dollar refit, passengers awaiting high-speed trains to Paris or Brussels can sip champagne at the continent's longest bar, or eat oysters and caviar at a fine-dining restaurant. With the value of the pound plummeting, though, Britons heading to Europe are not exactly in a celebratory mood. Trips to Paris used to involve ""a stroll around the shops to see if I could pick up some nice Parisian fashion,"" grumbles Jemima, a 35-year-old sales professional on her way to the French capital late one January afternoon. ""But not now."" Dashing to catch his train to Brussels, company director Andrew Cowgill thinks Britons have even begun ""questioning whether they want to go"" to Europe for vacation. (See 10 things to do in London.)

The strength of the pound has long been a source of British pride  the word ""sterling"" has come to describe something of the highest standard. When the pound plunges, as it did in 1976 and in 1992, the damage to the British psyche is almost as far-reaching as the impact on the economy. And right now sterling's losing its shine. In the past year, the U.K. currency has lost about a fifth of its value against the euro, the currency used in much of the rest of Europe, and 30% against the dollar. Causes aren't hard to come by. Worries over Britain's fast-shrinking economy, plunging interest rates, a wobbly banking sector and creaking government finances have driven traders to dump the pound. ""I would urge you to sell any sterling you might have,"" Jim Rogers, once a business partner of George Soros and now chairman of a Singapore investment company, told Bloomberg on Jan. 20 just before the pound hit a 23-year low. ""I hate to say it, but I would not put any money in the U.K."" (See pictures of the financial crisis in London.)

Having grown faster than Europe's other big economies over the past decade, British GDP will shrink more this year, estimates the E.U. Brits have begun comparing themselves to Iceland, another north Atlantic island buffeted by financial turmoil. When squatters were discovered living in two $20 million Park Lane mansions, it was taken as a powerful reminder of the recessions of the 1970s and 1980s. ""There will be lots more people like me in the coming months,"" said one of the squatters. Britain's opposition Conservative Party says things could get so bad that the country might have to go, cap in hand, to the International Monetary Fund.

That feeling of impending doom is speeding the collapse in sterling's value, and prompting renewed discussion about whether Britain should ditch the pound for the euro, which this month celebrated its first 10 years.

The British public, long a Euro-skeptic bunch, are having none of it. According to a January poll by ICM for the BBC, 71% of Britons remain opposed to adopting Europe's single currency; more than two-thirds said the pound's slide made no difference to their thinking. ""There's a long sentimental attraction to a coinage that has been around for such a large part of our history,"" says Nicholas Mayhew, a professor of monetary history at the University of Oxford's Ashmolean Museum. ""I'd be surprised if all that is lost in a matter of months.""

But sentimental attachment won't fix the problems the country faces today. A feeble pound should eventually give Britain's depressed exporters a boost, but that might not happen until 2010. Because the downturn is global, most manufacturers expect export orders to fall further in the coming months, according to the British employers' organization, the CBI. In the meantime, British holidaymakers used to vacationing in France or Spain are making plans for breaks closer to home. Outside the Bank of England, which moved to its present central London site in 1734, one oil-industry worker with a fondness for European travel says he'll ""just sit tight"" until the pound gets stronger again. Behind him, the city's buses shuttle workers home, with posters on their sides trumpeting the latest movie releases: Slumdog Millionaire, Seven Pounds, The Broken. They almost read like signs of the times.

Its impact on the global economy has been equally catastrophic, as governments have been forced into imposing strict lockdown measures. As economists face a generation-defining challenge on what to do next, all around the world focus is beginning to shift towards finance ministers – like Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the UK – rather than health ministers such as Matt Hancock.

But a warning from Mr Soros – the famed financier and philanthropist who was once credited with ‘breaking the pound’ – appears worryingly relevant today. Speaking to Newsweek in 2012, the billionaire warned of economic collapse and riots on the streets in light of the eurozone crisis of the time. Having bought $2billion (£1.6billion) in European bonds, he said: “The euro must survive because the alternative – a breakup – would cause a meltdown that Europe, the world, can’t afford. “The situation is about as serious and difficult as I’ve experienced in my career. We are facing now a general retrenchment in the developed world.”

His warnings came as US stocks plummeted amid talks intended to resolve Greece's debt crisis faltered. “The worst-case scenario is a collapse of the financial system.” The now 89-year-old also compared the crisis to the fall of the Soviet Union in the early Nineties, claiming a euro collapse could “revive the political conflicts that have torn Europe apart over the centuries”.

His fears appear just as relevant today as they did in 2012, as EU member states have been embroiled in a bitter row over how to split up the financial costs of the pandemic. Italy, for example, has consistently argued for more help from its European partners, as the current crisis was impossible to predict. While Germany and the Netherlands are opposed to the idea as they fear the political implications of having their taxpayers foot the bill for other nations. DON'T MISS

These divisions have opened up old wounds from the 2008 financial crisis. And former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis believes he can explain why – because the wounds never healed in the first place, they were merely hidden from view. In a video posted on his YouTube channel DiEM25 earlier this year, he said: ""Don't let anyone tell you the 2008 crisis ended and that now you have a new one. ""That crisis never ended. It just moved in different forms, travelled from one continent to another. ""But nevertheless it has always been with us. ""The world never went back to some kind of equilibrium after 2008. ""What coronavirus has done, it has deepened and accelerated this never-ending non-stop crisis that began in 2008.""

Mr Varoufakis also shed light on why he thinks the world was presented with the illusion of a recovery after 2011. He added: ""They printed trillions and trillions of notes and threw them at the 0.1 percent at corporations that were already full of money. For example, Apple, Google and so on. ""They boosted inequality massively and stabilised financial markets. But at the same time, they depleted all serious investments in good quality jobs in labour, health, education. ""This is why there has been so much discontent even before COVID-19 arrived on the scene."

In a voice-over, Kelly identifies the man as “Alex Jones, the radical conspiracy theorist”; then there is a quick cut to Jones, sitting at another desk, saying, “I agree with Trump. He agrees with me,” before Kelly continues, “with a new and surprising degree of influence, thanks, in part, to President Trump.” The President is then seen in his Trump Tower office, telling Jones, via a split-screen video, that he, Trump, will not let him down: “You will be very, very impressed, I hope.” Jones nods rapidly, his eyebrows drawn together in an expression of abject gratitude."
28,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions Saddam Hussein's government and senior archaeologists and museum staff members as actors responsible for the decline in Iraqi archaeology.,True,"The article discusses the actions of Saddam Hussein's government in funding the archaeology program, the researchers fleeing, and the policies of the Baath Party.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"BAGHDAD—The Iraq Museum and the State Board of Antiquities, which runs it, are getting a much-needed makeover. But the bigger challenge is to transform Iraqi archaeology into a modern research enterprise.

Saddam Hussein's oil-rich government showered Iraq's archaeology program with money and attention during the 1970s and 1980s. But in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, government funding dried up, researchers fled, and most foreign scientists stayed away. Politics also grew more intrusive, as senior archaeologists and museum staff members increasingly were expected to join the Baath Party, attend weekly meetings, and beat the drum for the repressive regime. The result was a quiet crisis in Iraqi archaeology even before looters descended on the museum.

“Thirteen years of sanctions affected us,” says museum director Nawalla al-Mutawalli. “We've fallen from the top ranks of museums.” The State Board of Antiquities, adds senior board official Rabia al-Qaisi, is eager to “become more technically up-to-date and scientifically current.” The first step in the process is an inventory of the storerooms, now more than half complete, notes Al-Mutawalli. In addition, donated computers and furniture now line the hallways, waiting to be installed.

But reversing the decline will require more than new office equipment. A decade's advances in excavation, preservation, and curatorial techniques by the outside world are unknown inside Iraq, and policies long scorned in the West—such as paying archaeologists bonuses for finding artifacts—are deeply ingrained. There are also cultural issues to overcome. “There is no motivation for work, no sense of initiative,” says Lebanese archaeologist and journalist Joanne Farchahk, who recently spent time at the museum. “They wait for big government to tell them what to do.”

On top of those problems, a cloud hangs over the museum's current management. A series of petitions has criticized Jaber Khalil, the board chair, and other senior managers for alleged corruption. Coalition officials say they see no basis for these complaints, and only one senior manager, a senior Baath Party member who served as Saddam's eyes and ears in the museum, has been forced from her position as head of excavations. Khalil—who is not a Baath Party member but who is related to Saddam's family—is in ill health and would like to retire or return to teaching at the University of Baghdad, museum officials add.

Coalition partners and foreign researchers want to leave management of the board to Iraqis to avoid being labeled colonial interlopers. But Iraqi officials say the door is open to mutually beneficial cooperation. Muayyad Damerji, former State Board chief and now a Ministry of Culture adviser, urged archaeologists gathered last month in London to reopen their Baghdad institutes and hinted that they might be able to resume excavations as early as next spring. Donny George, research director, added that he hopes a streamlined bureaucracy will make it easier for outside scientists to gain the necessary approvals."

It causes burning, pain, and tears when it comes into contact with a person’s eyes. Pepper sprays are available commercially for personal protection against assailants. Law enforcement agencies in the United States use pepper spray during policing and riot control. The use of pepper spray remains controversial. This article examines what is in pepper spray, whether it is dangerous, and how to treat exposure to pepper spray.

What is it? Pepper spray uses a high concentration of the chemical that adds spicy flavor to peppers to irritate the eyes. Pepper spray is a lachrymatory agent, meaning that it stimulates the eyes to produce tears. An oil known as oleoresin capsicum is the main component in pepper spray. Capsaicin is an inflammatory agent in the oil. This is the same chemical that adds the characteristic heat to chilli peppers. However, capsaicin is present in pepper spray at a much higher concentration. The heat of a bell pepper measures 0 on the Scoville Heat Units scale, which is used to measure the “heat” of peppers. A jalapeño pepper scores 2,500 to 5,000 on the same scale. The heat of pepper spray, however, ranges from 2 million units in commercial pepper sprays, marketed for use in self-defense, to 5.3 million Scoville units for police-issue spray. This same ingredient also forms the basis of bear spray, which reduces attacks during human encounters with bears. However, the concentration of capsaicin in bear spray is only 1 to 2 percent. Pepper sprays used in law enforcement reportedly have a capsaicin content of between 10 and 30 percent. As a result, its deployment has often been controversial, particularly when civilian protestors experience pepper spray use, such as during the Occupy Wall Street protests of 2011. Authorities classify pepper spray as a riot-control agent. Article I.5 of the Chemical Weapons Convention bans its use in war.

When a person comes into contact with pepper spray, their eyes will close immediately. They will experience a “bubbling” or “boiling” sensation, followed by temporary blindness and eye pain. The effects last from 30 to 45 minutes, depending on how strong the spray solution is. Pepper spray can also cause:
• the inability to breathe or speak In rare cases, it can cause cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin that indicates a lack of blood flow and oxygen. Apnea and respiratory arrest may also occur. A 1999 study from the North Carolina Medical Journal found that people who breathe in pepper spray could experience acute hypertension, or a sudden increase in blood pressure. This increases the risk of stroke or heart attack.

Since the 1980s, the police have often used pepper spray to subdue violent or uncooperative behavior. When pepper spray hits the face, it temporarily blinds the subject. This makes it easier for police officers to remove suspects from the scene and arrest them. The use of pepper spray is controversial. There have been reports of deaths in custody after police officers used pepper spray. On the other side of the debate, a 2003 study of North Carolina jurisdictions reported that the number of police officers injured on duty decreased after the introduction of pepper spray. During the Occupy protests in 2011, the media began to scrutinize the use of pepper spray by police. Videos emerged showing police officers repeatedly spraying peaceful protestors for prolonged periods, although guidelines state that the spray should be used for no more than one second on any person. The deployment of pepper spray by law enforcement officers can be controversial for other reasons. A 2016 study by Harvard University researchers, for instance, found that, in the U.S., police are 25 percent more likely to pepper-spray African-American people than white people. Pepper spray is known as a “nonlethal weapon,” or a weapon that cannot kill people. However, deaths have occurred following the use of pepper spray. People with asthma have a higher chance of complications. In 2003, a Department of Justice report found that pepper spray directly contributed to the deaths of 2 people out of 63 cases, where suspects held in custody died after pepper spray was used in their arrest. The report attributed the cause of two deaths to pepper spray, citing pre-existing asthma as a contributing factor. The other causes of death were found to be drug use, disease, positional asphyxia, or a combination. However, the same report concluded the following: “Pepper spray inhalation alone does not pose a significant risk for respiratory compromise or asphyxiation, even when combined with positional restraint.” The commercially available pepper sprays can also serve as an effective deterrent during street attacks and assaults."

The investment from Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Planned Parenthood Votes, the organization's political entities, makes it one of the biggest outside spending forces in Democratic politics headed into a cycle in which the party sees a rare opportunity to pick off GOP seats across the map.

It's part of Planned Parenthood's effort to sustain the momentum of the Women's March the day after President Donald Trump's inauguration and turn women's health care and reproductive rights into issues that drive voters to the ballot box to oppose Trump and GOP candidates.

The initial list of targets includes eight states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

It comes on top of $4.5 million spent on last year's governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. The groups are set to announce their plans later Thursday. The targeted states are part of a two-for-one approach of prioritizing states with competitive races this fall for both Senate seats that could help Democrats keep Trump in check and governors' offices that are crucial to the redistricting process after the 2020 Census. Riding the momentum from the #resistance, Planned Parenthood is 'going on the offense' ""This is our last chance to flip some of those governors' seats before redistricting,"" said Deirdre Schifeling, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. ""A lot of those states have governors who have been terrible for women, terrible for access to reproductive health care."" Arizona and Nevada are particularly important: The states represent Democrats' two best chances of picking off GOP-held Senate seats this cycle, with Nevada Sen. Dean Heller seen as vulnerable in a state Hillary Clinton won and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake retiring in what's rapidly becoming a swing state. A handful of House races are likely to join the list of targets, with officials eyeing contests in California, New Jersey, New York and Texas as potential targets. And state legislative races and attorneys general contests are also on a watch list of races that could be added. Planned Parenthood is also spending money in Democratic primaries, including backing Marie Newman in her bid to unseat Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, who opposes abortion rights. Planned Parenthood's political arms argue that reproductive health has been a driving issue in recent elections, citing the group's own polling showing that black voters moved toward Ralph Northam in the Virginia governor's race by 19 points and older voters and moderates also moved in Northam's favor after hearing reproductive health care and rights messaging. In Nevada, the group argues, Republican former Rep. Joe Heck's opposition to Planned Parenthood was a deciding factor in Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto's win in 2016. The emphasis of the digital program, in a nod to the reshaped electorates in Virginia and Alabama's Senate special election, is on engaging with infrequent voters, young people and people of color, especially women. It will begin with efforts to engage with those voters on issues they care about and persuade them that their voices matter in the current political moment and later switch to a focus on elections and individual candidates. The organization is also planning large-scale, state-level training programs for activists. ""We're doing this work in such a way to make sure that we are furthering this activism we're seeing in this moment into long-term electoral engagement,"" Robinson said."

Fighting intensified to the north and south of Saddam’s hometown on Sunday as Iraqi security forces vowed to reach the centre of Tikrit within 48 hours. All that was left of Hussein’s once-lavish tomb were the support columns that held up the roof.

Poster-sized pictures of Saddam, which once covered the mausoleum, were nowhere to be seen amid the mountains of concrete rubble. Instead, Shia militia flags and photographs of militia leaders marked the predominantly Sunni village, including that of Major General Qassem Suleimani, the powerful Iranian general advising Iraqi Shia militias on the battlefield.

“This is one of the areas where IS militants massed the most because Saddam’s grave is here,” said Captain Yasser Nu’ma, an official with the Shia militias, formerly known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces. He said the Isis militants set a trap by planting bombs around the tomb.

Isis has controlled Tikrit since June, when it waged its lightning offensive that saw Iraq’s second-largest city, Mosul, come under their control. The militants were helped in their conquest of northern Iraq by Saddam loyalists, including military veterans, who appealed to Sunnis who felt victimised by Baghdad’s Shia-dominated government.

Isis claimed in August that Saddam’s tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said it was just ransacked and burned, but suffered only minor damage.

Saddam was captured by US forces in 2003 and was executed by hanging in December 2006 after an Iraqi special tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity for the mass killing of Shias and Kurds. His body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace, Ouja, since 2007. The complex featured a marble octagon at the center of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried. The extravagant chandelier at its centre was reminiscent of the extravagant life he led until US forces toppled him in 2003.

Iraqi media reported last year that Saddam’s body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting. The body’s location is not known.

Recapturing Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris river, would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which US officials have said could come as soon as next month.

Concerns are mounting that Iraq’s Shia militias, of which an estimated 20,000 are fighting in Tikrit, will carry out revenge attacks on this and other areas that are home to predominantly Sunni residents.

Amnesty International last year said the militias wore military uniforms but operated outside any legal framework and without any official oversight, adding that they were not prosecuted for their crimes. Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch echoed those concerns, calling on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones. Its statement noted “numerous atrocities” against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces.

Shia militants are increasingly being accused of levelling the Sunni towns they capture from Isis, making it impossible for residents to return. Tikrit has already been heavily damaged in months of violence. A satellite image of Tikrit, released last month by the UN, observed that at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting, with at least 137 completely destroyed and 241 severely damaged.

Local Sunni tribal fighters have formed uneasy alliances with the Iraqi army and Shia militias in the battle for Tikrit, which Iraqi and US officials believe is essential for defeating the Sunni militant group.

Yazan al-Jubouri, a Sunni from Tikrit fighting alongside the Shia militias, said that the Isis militants killed 16 of his relatives and kept his family living in horror.

“We want to take revenge on those Isis militants who killed our children,” he said."

• Healthcare has becomes a prominent part of the 2020 presidential campaign, and the healthcare industry's donations to candidates have come under scrutiny.
• Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has said he won't take funds from drugmakers and health insurers and called on other candidates to follow.
• The healthcare sector, which includes drugmakers, health insurers, doctors, and hospitals, has contributed more than $5 million so far towards the many presidential candidates, according to data from OpenSecrets through the end of June.
• President Donald Trump's re-election campaign was a top recipient of healthcare dollars, and Sanders' campaign ranked in the top five. Read on to see how much every candidate received.

Healthcare is a major issue in the upcoming 2020 presidential election.

It's also become a flashpoint when it comes to presidential campaign contributions, with longtime Vermont Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders saying he won't take donations from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries and calling on other candidates to follow.

So far, the healthcare sector has contributed more than $5 million in total towards the many presidential candidates, from President Donald Trump's re-election campaign all the way to his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, according to new data from the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics's OpenSecrets covering the campaign season through the end of June.

With nearly 30 Democratic contenders gearing up to face off against President Donald Trump, many have said that expanding access to health coverage should be a priority — and some, like Sanders, have pushed for a bigger overhaul of the US healthcare system advocating ""Medicare for All.""

Sanders has said he won't take funds from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries in pursuit of that goal.

The presidential candidate put out a No Health Insurance and Pharma Money Pledge that bars ""knowingly"" taking contributions of more than $200 from political action committees, lobbyists and executives of drugmakers like Merck and Novartis and health insurers like Cigna and Kaiser Permanente. But it does not extend to the average employee. The pledge also does not apply to other healthcare sectors like hospitals.

The stance represents a departure from the 2016 election, when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and Trump both blasted the pharmaceutical industry and its high drug prices, while still taking campaign donations.

Read on to see how much the 2020 candidates have brought in from the health sector so far. We reached out to every campaign for comment, and included responses below if we received them.

The data from OpenSecrets includes contributions from employees at hospitals, health insurers and makers of drugs and medical supplies, as well as professionals like dentists and nurses as part of the healthcare sector.

OpenSecrets doesn't yet have data on Tom Steyer and Joe Sestak, who declared their candidacies more recently. Mike Gravel's contributions aren't included because they're largely small and not categorized, OpenSecrets said."
36,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, who is responsible for coordinating the company's response to the new coronavirus.",True,"The article mentions the actions taken by Facebook to provide accurate and timely information about the new coronavirus, such as directing users to credible sources and removing false claims and conspiracy theories.",False,The article does not mention any threats related to the actions of powerful actors.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections between events or observations.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead the public or cover up information.,"In a time of crisis, it is now probably the single most important source of news for billions of people around the world.

So what is Facebook doing to make sure that it is providing accurate and timely information about the new coronavirus? Plenty, according to Mark Zuckerberg.

In a post last night, Facebook's founder explains that his company has been working closely with health authorities to co-ordinate their response to the virus.

""We're focused on making sure everyone can access credible and accurate information,"" he says.

As part of that effort, any search for coronavirus produces a pop-up directing users to the World Health Organisation or local health authorities for information.

Facebook has also given free ads to the WHO to inform people, and Mark Zuckerberg says the social network will give millions in ad credits to other organisations involved in the battle to contain Covid-19.

But there is also a job to be done battling spam and misinformation.

Facebook's founder says that while it is important that everyone can share their experiences, the firm is removing false claims and conspiracy theories. It is also blocking ads that exploit the situation - ""for example, claiming that their product can cure the disease"".

That is likely to prove a mammoth task, particularly when it comes to information circulating inside Facebook Groups.

Look, for instance, at the Stop 5G UK group. Its members are busy posting conspiracy theories.

""Anyone else think that part of the Coronavirus hoax is to undermine and prevent Brexit from happening?"" reads one post.

YouTube videos with titles such as ""Coronavirus - a Globalist Tool"" are also shared.
• Coronavirus: Should I self-isolate and how do I do it?
• Coronavirus: UK advice, symptoms, tests and treatment - in five graphics

The fact that so many users link to YouTube videos means that Facebook has to rely on the platform to join it in the battle against misinformation.

But despite YouTube's efforts to stop the spread of conspiracy theories, its own app is awash with various ""experts"" from around the world delivering lengthy rants connecting the virus, 5G and global plots to bring in compulsory vaccination.

Some of these appear to break both YouTube and Facebook's rules about advertising bogus cures.

A couple of days ago, I alerted YouTube to one video from a British anti-5G campaigner. He also has an online store offering products such as anti-radiation hoods and tents.

In this case, his video was promoting a Russian USB stick which apparently offered protection against both 5G and the coronavirus. YouTube agreed that this broke its rules, and took it down.

I've seen other ads on Facebook that appear to skirt close to exploiting the situation.

""Stay healthy this flu season with our new carbon filter face mask"" reads one. Yours for just £29.95.

Other ads offer Covid-19 masks, direct from China at £65 for 100.

There is at least some evidence of a fightback from some Facebook group moderators against conspiracy theories.

A member of the Stop 5G UK group posted this complaint about her local community group in Leeds: ""Any 'conspiracy' anything to do with 5G/anything other than mainstream media is being taken down straight away.""

And indeed anyone wanting to join the Leedsplace Facebook group will find this message: ""PCT's - Paranoid Conspiracy Theorists - We respect your right to be gullible but we will not allow PCT's to proliferate on Leedsplace. So if you subscribe to PCT's such as 'vaccines cause autism' or chemtrails are poisoning us or Holocaust denial and use this group to spread misinformation you risk being banned without warning.""

But plenty of other groups built around causes such as opposition to vaccines, actively encourage the spread of conspiratorial material.

And fighting the spread of misinformation is going to get harder, as Facebook encourages its users to retreat to more private corners of its empire.

Who knows, for instance, what is being said about the coronavirus inside WhatsApp groups?

In it, he outlined plans to expand use of end-to-end encryption - a feature at the heart of WhatsApp - across other Facebook services.

But if, as he predicts, the future of communication increasingly shifts ""to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure"", then it will be much harder to stop the spread of dangerous nonsense."

Many more former leaders of our country should issue a joint statement to the world -- more like an apology -- for letting our very stable genius flourish. (“Welcome back, Barack. What took you so long?” column, May 13)

I propose that a letter by the following leaders from both parties be issued: all living ex-presidents and ex-vice presidents, former leaders in the House and Senate, retired judges, former military and intelligence agency leaders, ex-Cabinet secretaries and people who served in federal agencies and on commissions.

They should tell the world that this is not who we are, and the American people that this is not business as usual.

To the editor: We see yet another instance of the Trump administration making up conspiracy theories and lying to the American public to distract attention from its failure to prepare for a pandemic.

Now, the cries are “Obamagate” and “unmasking.” Surely, some of the Trump cultists will believe what is being spread while failing to understand “unmasking” is common.

As former CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell noted, “unmasking is common -- literally hundreds of times a year across multiple administrations.” And, as journalist Andrea Mitchell tweeted, “10 thousand unmasking last year, 17 thousand in 2018. Necessary and routine. Can people please stop trying to gaslight us?”

We should not allow ourselves to be played by the Trump administration’s lies and propaganda.

To the editor: I understand that lying to the FBI, to which former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty, is not legal.

With that said, how were Flynn’s actions any different than those of retire Marine Gen. James Cartwright, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during a leak investigation but was given a full pardon by Obama in 2017?"

That one turned up on my Facebook feed this morning.

As the fast-moving Australian fires have incinerated communities, taken lives and destroyed wildlife, the speed of their progress has been matched only by the conspicuous amplification of online conspiracy theories to explain them.

A few weeks ago, there was a chorus of insistence that the fires weren’t really happening, and communists at, um, CNN were digitally enhancing photos of the blood-red fire skies with the devil’s own brand of MS Paint. Since the fires have expanded, smoke haze has stained skies as far away as New Zealand, and the conspiracy theories have adapted to a changing environment. For taking a visible leadership role in the defence of his burning state, the Labor premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, has been rewarded with anonymous online memes insisting – despite verified evidence to the contrary – on his plunder of firefighting resources, that he bathes in money, and, presumably, marches around his home in slippers made from the skulls of baby seals.

These aren’t even the most pernicious of the rumours. A hazy map that tries to claim the fires are some kind of deliberate scheme to clear land for a high-speed rail is of concern because it directly copies an easily debunked claim made during the California wildfires. Even more concerning are the online conspiracy theories seeping into mainstream discourse. There’s an adamant refrain that Australia’s tiny, powerless Greens party has magically banned hazard reduction burns despite holding but one seat among the 151 in the federal parliament. In truth, you can book a hazard reduction burn – with the assistance of government services – by filling in an online form, but members of Liberal Scott Morrison’s own government have been repeating the “ban” myth for months.

Today, both Donald Trump Jr and Rupert Murdoch’s local News Corp brands have been pushing the “arson emergency” theme to our fires, blaming them on nefarious firebugs. News Corp are citing figures for “arson” arrests that are, politely, inconsistent with those released by the police. Again, the Victorian premier has confirmed police information that not a single fire currently raging in this state has been deliberately lit. Yet the arson myth has already been dogging social media commentary for weeks – and a QUT study reported on Tuesday its appearance is no hapless whisper but conforms to the patterns of a coordinated disinformation campaign.

Of course, it’s not just trollbots but ordinary citizens who have been recruited as campaign megaphones – knowingly or not. Anyone with ad space to sell has long known that people are more susceptible to be persuaded into action when they’re frightened and they’re angry. For unscrupulous political persuaders, there are ready pickings in burning Australia, where real red skies and the consequences of inept federal government response has given the locals much to be frightened and angry about. For the cashed up and willing, disinformation services are for sale: Buzzfeed reports that companies offer to “use every tool and take every advantage available in order to change reality according to our client’s wishes”.

To understand the ruthless waves of disinformation spreading online – and those so willing to spruik their claims – is to understand how the Australian fires have also given the political right much to fear. Commentators elsewhere have made the point that years of weaponising the issue of climate change as a battlefront for a culture war has been a valuable asset for rightwing political movements, electorally and beyond.

In Australia, outspoken climate change denial has provided conservatives electoral access to traditionally Labor blue-collar resource industry communities, who have been made anxious about what “transitions” to a low-emissions economy will entail for their jobs and prospects. The fear the right has so successfully manipulated is that of economic annihilation, yet what the fires have come to represent to Australians is how real economic annihilation is now as close to them as a lit cigarette in a change of wind burning down their home or business.

The science is concluded: it’s climate change that has drawn out the Australian fire season, by heating the temperature and drying the air. The intense disinformation campaign online is a mad scramble from those interests that are vested in ongoing climate denial to confuse and obfuscate the facts of the fires and thereby head off any political pressure for meaningful climate action that may coalesce in their wake.

Disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz refers to what is going on here as “a type of information laundering”. It poses danger not only to democracy, its impact on policy decisions affect our physical capacity to protect communities – whether from fire, or anything else.

If political actors are invested in disinformation, citizens can still minimise its spread. “If there is any doubt about content you’re reading – don’t share it!” says Jankowicz, who recommends a report-block-ban-delete response to online strangers pushing obvious lies. “If someone you love or an acquaintance online is sharing false news, it’s best to approach them in a private setting where stakes are lower – a private phone call, direct message, or face to face conversation,” she recommends.

It’s crucial advice. The bleak reality of the internet means there may always be those willing to insist party sparklers are raining catastrophic fires on Australia from heaven. Just as important as fighting any fire right now is fighting the kind of fear that may make others believe them."

Its mission: helping children ""grow stronger, smarter and kinder"". And to that end, the people behind the US television series have introduced a new character this week.

Julia, the show's latest muppet, has bright orange hair, green eyes and likes to ride the swings with Elmo, the short, furry, red character. But Julia doesn't answer questions right away and gets visibly upset over loud noises. She's autistic, a disorder that affects one in 68 children in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Jeanette Betancourt, Sesame Workshop's senior vice president of US social impact, says it took three years of research and consultations with experts from institutions such as the Yale Child Study Center to bring Julia to life.

""We had a coalition of diverse autism organisations,"" Betancourt told Al Jazeera. ""We discussed our prototype materials ... with families with children with autism [and] with young [autistic] children.""

Julia's introduction is part of ""Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children"", an online initiative launched to raise awareness about autism and reduce bullying in schools and combat the ostracism of autistic children.

For now, Julia, who is described as an old friend of Elmo's, will not appear on the broadcast programme, but rather, in a digital storybook available online and in print - materials associated with the autism initiative.

In addition to the storybook with audio narration, the website also features videos about autism and ""animated aid cards"" that help teach basic skills to autistic students. An app with games and activities is also available.

In one scene in the new online book, Elmo introduces Julia to another friend: Abby. But Julia does not respond to Abby, prompting the latter to say, ""Your friend doesn’t like me.""

""Elmo's daddy told Elmo that Julia has autism,"" Elmo explains. ""So she does things a little differently. Sometimes Elmo talks to Julia using fewer words and says the same things a few times.""

Autistic children have different characteristics: some cannot maintain eye contact, are sensitive to noise and at times cannot talk. Because of this, some groups consider autism a syndrome, while others say it's a different means of expression.

But for the makers of Sesame Street, Julia will help tackle the prevailing problems of stigma and isolation. According to one study, six out of 10 children with autism have been bullied.

""We know that a child with autism is five times more likely to be bullied than a neurotypical child,"" Betancourt said. ""It is our hope that kids with autism will feel more included and understood as the general public becomes more aware of the similarities all children share.""

Some experts believe that creating Julia is a step in the right direction and hope to see Sesame Street expand this initiative.

""Children are especially visual beings and develop while playing and making art,"" said Shireen Yaish, an art psychotherapist and founder of the Kaynouna Arab Art Therapy Center in Amman, Jordan.

""That's why incorporating autism in Sesame Street, which is educational and mainstream, will not only help normalise the fact that there are autistic children, but will also help children understand autism and how to be tolerant and accepting,"" Yaish told Al Jazeera."

The country has reported 86,498 cases and 9,134 deaths as of Saturday, March 28.

But one small Italian town claims to have eradicated coronavirus infections, having now reached zero new cases after implementing a mass-testing programme in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.

The town, Vo Euganeo - population 3,300 - based in the heartlands of the most contaminated area of northern Italy, saw a cluster of cases of COVID-19 in the third week of February and was home to the country's first death from the virus, on February 21.

So, while the draconian measures taken in China to get the coronavirus under control may not be suitable for other countries, could we learn, instead, from this small Italian town?

Following the town's first death from coronavirus, the whole town was put under lockdown.

No one was allowed to enter or leave, while goods (medicines and food) could only reach the town if authorised to do so by the Prefetto, the central government representative in Padua. Then all of the town's 3,300 residents, including those with no symptoms, were tested for the virus starting from March 6.

This allowed quarantining of people who had been infected, before they showed any signs of infection and stopped any further spread of the coronavirus in its tracks.

Within 14 days, the virus had been eradicated from the community. This mass testing revealed that about 3 percent of residents were infected with the virus at that point, and, of these, about half were not showing any symptoms when they tested positive.

After two weeks of a strict lockdown of the entire town and the quarantine of infected patients, only 0.25 percent of residents were testing as infected. Vo Euganeo has not reported any new cases since Friday, March 13.

In the first round of testing, 89 people in Vo Euganeo tested positive. In the second round of testing, the number of positive cases had dropped to six.

Because of a combination of universal testing and lockdown across the entire town, Vo Euganeo managed to avoid the number of cases spiralling out of control, thereby minimising the risk of a huge demand on their health services. In effect, they nipped it in the bud by taking aggressive and decisive action early to stop the spread of the disease.

All of this was achieved with a 100 percent recovery rate for those previously infected.

Writing about this case, Andrea Cristani, a professor of microbiology at the University of Padua in Italy who helped carry out the testing, and Antonio Cassone, the former director of the department of infectious diseases at the Italian Institute of Health, said: ""In the last two weeks, a promising pilot study here has produced results that may be instructive for other countries trying to control coronavirus.

""Beginning on 6 March, along with researchers at the University of Padua and the Red Cross, we tested all residents of Vo, a town of 3,000 inhabitants near Venice - including those who did not have symptoms. This allowed us to quarantine people before they showed signs of infection and stop the further spread of coronavirus. In this way, we eradicated coronavirus in under 14 days.""

Elsewhere in Italy - as in other countries - however, the authorities chose only to test those who already displayed symptoms.

The decision to only test those who presented for treatment with symptoms of the virus was taken by major Italian public health experts, apparently in line with World Health Organization (WHO) suggestions.

But, according to Cristani and Cassone, asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70 percent of all virus-infected people and, still worse, a huge number of them can transmit the virus to others without realising they are doing so.

As shown in Vo Euganeo, full community testing gives a clearer picture of how many people actually have the virus, and how many pass it on.

The key factor is that testing only those who display symptoms of the virus gives only a vague and misleading indicator not only of how many people have caught the virus but also of the overall percentage mortality rates.

Other countries should look closely at the results of the case study in Vo Euganeo.

It may be difficult to implement such a testing strategy right across a major city or indeed the whole of a country, but it may well be possible to implement this approach in pocket areas where infections are spreading rapidly and therefore contain the spread of the virus before the number of cases increases. This would help to avoid the risk of high demand on hospitals.

Governments could identify and isolate coronavirus cluster areas, test everyone in these communities and quarantine each resident - whether they have symptoms or not - and then trace their recent contacts, and test and quarantine those people as well.

Full testing is the only way in which countries will gain a clear picture of the actual numbers who have the virus and, therefore, how many people risk infecting others without even knowing they are doing it.

In the absence of a vaccine, the identification of all carriers (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) appears to be the most effective way to control the pandemic.

The mass testing example in Vo Euganeo echoes the recent statement from the World Health Organisation (WHO).

""We have a simple message to all countries - test, test, test,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, said at a news briefing last week.

""All countries should be able to test all suspected cases. They cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded.""

Rockland County, on the Hudson river north of New York City, has barred unvaccinated children from public spaces after 153 cases were confirmed.

Violating the order will be punishable by a fine of $500 (£378) and up to six months in prison.

The announcement follows other outbreaks of the disease in Washington, California, Texas and Illinois.

Vaccination rates have dropped steadily in the US with many parents objecting for philosophical or religious reasons, or because they believe discredited information that vaccines cause autism in children.

""We will not sit idly by while children in our community are at risk,"" Rockland County Executive Ed Day said.

""This is a public health crisis and it is time to sound the alarm.""

Why has this county taken action?

The outbreak in Rockland County is largely concentrated in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, the New York Times reported. It is believed it could have spread from other predominantly ultra-Orthodox areas around New York which have already seen outbreaks of measles.

Mr Day said health inspectors had encountered ""resistance"" from some local residents, which he branded ""unacceptable and irresponsible"".

""They've been told 'We're not discussing this, do not come back' when visiting the homes of infected individuals as part of their investigations,"" he said.

According to the CDC, there are 314 cases of measles currently reported in the US, with nearly half of those coming from Rockland County.

Dylan Skriloff, the editor of local newspaper the Rockland County Times, told the BBC the number of measles cases in the county had been increasing steadily in recent weeks.

""The first reports came six months ago, and each week we've had a new report with increased numbers,"" he said.

""It's become clear that it's not abating, and the authorities... don't want to accept [this reality] as the new normal.""

Skriloff said that the authorities had been making ""steady progress"" in encouraging religious communities to immunise children but communication had broken down in the last month.

""The rate of immunisation in the religious communities, for young people, it's about 50%-60%, which is not nearly enough.""
• 'Don't be taken in by social media vaccine myths'

Officials said the order, which bans anyone under the age of 18 who has not been vaccinated from places such as schools, shopping centres, restaurants and places of worship, would come into effect at midnight on Wednesday and last 30 days.

However, the order notes that authorities ""will not be patrolling or asking for vaccination records"", just referring those found to violate the order to the District Attorney's Office.

Some critics say that without a plan to enforce the order, it is a useless measure that fails to protect anyone, while others have accused the local government of overreach.

Rockland County has a population of more than 300,000.

Why are there so many outbreaks?

Both Europe and the US are dealing with outbreaks of measles, but why now?

Nothing has changed about the virus; the answer instead lies in human behaviour.

Myths about the vaccine causing autism have been debunked but are still affecting the number of children being immunised. And complacency from a generation of parents unfamiliar with the dangers of measles has also had an effect.

So with every year that goes by, the total number of unvaccinated people grows, often in pockets in some communities. It is like an ever-growing tinderbox just waiting for a spark.

Measles still runs rampant in many parts of the world - it kills around 90,000 people a year. All it takes is a bit of travel for measles to reach those vulnerable pockets and spread like wildfire.

What has happened elsewhere with measles vaccinations?

Measles is a highly infectious disease and can cause serious health complications, including damage to the lungs and brain.

But despite the dangers, vaccination rates are declining in many countries.

In the UK, the government is seeking new legislation to force social media companies to remove content promoting false information about vaccines.

There were more than 82,500 cases in Europe in 2018 - the highest number in a decade and three times the total reported in 2017.

The World Health Organization has declared the anti-vaccine movement to be one of the top global health threats for 2019.

The proposal would see scientists inject the stratosphere – a part of Earth’s atmosphere which is about 20 kilometres above the surface – with reflective sulphites which reflect sunlight back into the cosmos. If successful, it would prevent solar energy from adding to the heating globe which will eventually reduce climate change.

The project, if it is launched, could take up to 15 years to complete. Dr Gernot Wagner, from Harvard University‘s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and co-author of the study published in Environmental Research Letters: “Given the potential benefits of halving average projected increases in radiative forcing from a particular date onward, these numbers invoke the ‘incredible economics’ of solar geoengineering. “Dozens of countries could fund such a program, and the required technology is not particularly exotic.” To get the sulphites into the atmosphere, researchers from Harvard and Yale universities propose using a high-altitude aircraft, balloons or large naval-style guns.

Co-author Wake Smith, a lecturer at Yale College, who was formerly president of the flight training division of Boeing, said: “I became intrigued by the engineering questions around SAI and the many studies that purport to show that modified existing planes could do the job. Turns out that is not so. “It would indeed take an entirely new plane design to do SAI under reasonable albeit entirely hypothetical parameters. “No existing aircraft has the combination of altitude and payload capabilities required.” “We developed the specifications for SAI with direct input from several aerospace and engine companies. It’s equivalent in weight to a large narrow body passenger aircraft.

“But to sustain level flight at 20 kms, it needs roughly double the wing area of an equivalently sized airliner, and double the thrust, with four engines instead of two. “At the same time, its fuselage would be stubby and narrow, sized to accommodate a heavy but dense mass of molten sulphur rather than the large volume of space and air required for passengers.” However, the researchers state this is purely hypothetical for the time being.

Dr Wagner added: “It would also be remarkably inexpensive.” “Solar geoengineering is often described as ‘fast, cheap, and imperfect’. “While we don’t make any judgement about the desirability of SAI, we do show that a hypothetical deployment program starting 15 years from now, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would be technically possible strictly from an engineering perspective. “It would also be remarkably inexpensive, at an average of around $2bn – $2.5bn (£1.5bn – £1.9bn) per year over the first 15 years."""

There is no scientific link between vaccines and autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Darla Shine, wife of White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Bill Shine, is arguing that serious diseases like measles can help fight cancer.

“The entire Baby Boom population alive today had the #Measles as kids,” Shine — who, along with the White House, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment — continued.

Shine went on to claim that she had measles, mumps and chicken pox as a child “and so did every kid I knew.”

However, despite claiming to be an anti-vaxxer herself, Shine said, “my kids had #MMR [the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine] so they will never have the life long natural immunity I have.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the MMR vaccine is recommended in preventing measles, mumps and rubella.

“Children should get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age,” the CDC states.

According to the CDC, more than 70,000 measles cases were prevented in the US between 1994 and 2013 as a result of vaccines.

While many Americans, including Shine, survived the disease after it passed, that hasn’t always been the case.

“In the decade before 1963 when a vaccine became available, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. Also each year, among reported cases, an estimated 400 to 500 people died,” according to the CDC.

There is also no proof that contracting measles can help in the prevention of cancer.

“The wife of a top aide to the president is a health hazard. All by herself. Anti-vaxxers are killers, murdering children with fake science, trying to turn their ignorance into a fatal epidemic,” one social media user tweeted.

Each year the World Health Organization, or WHO, publishes a list of the ten biggest threats to world health to set its agenda for the next 12 months. This is the first year that vaccine hesitancy has made the list."
44,True,The article discusses the 'QAnon' conspiracy group and its connection to President Donald Trump.

Michael Lebron, a New York-based attorney and radio host who goes by the name “Lionel,” shared the photo on Friday morning, with an accompanying video that showed him poring through a White House “swag bag.”

Lebron has grown his online following by sharing speculation about QAnon conspiracy theory. In the social media post Friday, he assured his fans that the president “knows about” the theory.

QAnon, an outgrowth of the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory — which posited that Hillary Clinton and other elites were members of a secretive pedophile ring — has mushroomed in popularity since first appearing as a poster on the 8Chan web forum last October.

In short posts, consisting of “crumbs” of haiku-like phrases, “Q” assures readers that its aim is to expose the child trafficking network and stop a coup by the so-called “deep state.” In Q’s posts, an inevitable “storm” will arrive, revealing that Trump detractors like Clinton and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have already been arrested for crimes against the American people.

Lebron, who posts regular videos on a “Lionel Nation” YouTube channel, has urged viewers to absorb Q’s posts and follow along for clues of the coming “storm.” He also frequently appears on the Russia-funded television network RT, where he is cited as a “legal and media analyst,” and typically offers positive commentary about Trump.

“Q’s it. The bomb. The future. The ignition switch, the connection, the conduit,” Lebron wrote in a July 4 blog post. “It’s like having your own personal Deep Throat, your own Mark Felt. Just imagine that. Better, where Commissioner Gordon summoned Batman through the bat signal, here our Batman summons us when he, she, it or they feel it necessary.”

In other posts, Lebron has called for “The indictment of Hillary Clinton et vir for involvement in large scale criminal enterprises” and “the creation of a permanent committee deconstructing and exposing the official narrative fiction of 9/11. The mythology must be corrected.”

Lebron did not respond for a request for comment, but has posted more than two hours of commentary about his White House visit, with one picture with the hashtag #WWG1WGA — a reference to the QAnon slogan “where we go one, we go all.”

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the photo or meeting.

45,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Dr. Martha Herbert and Dr. Larry Silver as scientists studying the impact of toxic chemicals on brain development.,True,The article discusses the research study conducted by Dr. Martha Herbert and Dr. Larry Silver on toxic chemicals and their impact on brain development.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections between events or observations.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"During the last decade the reported cases of autism and other illnesses related to brain development have dramatically increased not just in the U.S. but around the world. Scientists say the increase cannot be explained by genetics and they believe it's linked to the increase of toxic chemicals in the environment. 



Dr. Martha Herbert is a pediatric neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. She's directing a large research study on toxic chemicals in the environment and their impact on brain development, including autism. ""The genes load the gun,"" she said. ""But the environment pulls the trigger."" 



For years, scientists have believed that autism was genetically based. 



But Dr. Herbert believes environmental factors can either trigger or worsen the illness. 



She says finding those elements early in life and changing them could determine the severity of the disease. ""We have a system in the body called the detoxification system, detoxification is another variant. In detoxification you get rid of things that you don't want either your body's own waste products or things that get in which you don't want to have around,"" she said. ""It can be air pollution, it can be plastics in the food, it can be pesticides that are in so many of our products.""

Dr. Herbert's research involves babies, school age children and adults, with and without autism. 



She is trying to find out how the brain becomes autistic and at what point. 



She has been following Kenzie and Cooper, brothers who don't have autism. Like others in her study, she tests them regularly for toxic chemicals, brain imaging changes and developmental disorders.



""My personal commitment is to test and if it is true then to show that the influence of chemicals on the brain is not just during development but in your whole life,"" Dr. Herbert explained.



Dr. Herbert is not alone in looking at the environment.

Dr. Larry Silver is a Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. He has been researching learning disabilities for more than 40 years. He says he knows enough to be concerned about toxic chemicals in the environment. ""We have increasing concern that the environmental toxins may be contributing to these disabilities and also to the increase in these disabilities,"" he said. 



In the U.S. nearly 3 million people have been diagnosed with autism. While in 1994 one in every 1000 children was diagnosed with the disease, today there is one for every 110.

Jeff Sell at the Autism Society says numbers around the world are similar. ""Genetics alone cannot explain that type of increase in prevalence,"" he said. Two of Sell's four children are autistic, even though there's no family history. ""My boys both have high mercury levels, lead, pcvs,"" he added.



For many years, advocates for autism patients believed the disease is caused by vaccinations, especially the measles vaccine. But several studies found no link between vaccines and autism. 



Now Sell and the Autism Society are pressing to update legislation on toxic chemicals. He says there are more than 82,000 chemicals being released into the environment, but there's good information on only 200. 



He says we are damaging not only the human population, but the world we live in."

Almost two-thirds of the cases were reported in just four countries, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press conference Wednesday at the agency's Geneva headquarters. ""We still have a long way to go in this pandemic.""

The majority of new confirmed cases are coming from the Americas, followed by Europe, according to WHO's daily report. The U.S. reported 45,251 new cases on Tuesday, according to the agency. Russia had the second-most reported cases Tuesday at 9,263, according to WHO.

There are now close to 5 million global cases and roughly 325,000 deaths since the virus emerged in Wuhan, China, less than five months ago, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The WHO has been warning world leaders that there can be ""no going back to business as usual"" following the Covid-19 outbreak, which has upended economies and wreaked havoc on nearly every country around the globe.

The agency has told countries that they will need to manage around the coronavirus for the foreseeable future as cases level off or decline in some countries, while peaking in others and resurging in areas where the Covid-19 pandemic appeared to be under control.

While social distancing measures put in place in numerous countries to slow the spread of the coronavirus have been successful, the virus remains ""extremely dangerous,"" WHO officials have said. Current data show ""most of the world's population remains susceptible,"" they said, meaning outbreaks can easily ""reignite.""

The new record in cases comes as President Donald Trump threatens to permanently pull funding from the agency.

During the press briefing, WHO officials said they are worried their emergency programs will suffer if Trump follows through on his threats.

Most funding from the United States goes directly to the program that helps countries all over the world in ""all sorts of fragile and difficult settings,"" said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies program."
47,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions senior officials at the C.I.A. and the White House as responsible for ignoring the findings from Mr. Nixon's interrogations.,True,The article discusses the actions of senior officials at the C.I.A. and the White House in ignoring the findings from Mr. Nixon's interrogations.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"The findings from Mr. Nixon’s interrogations of Hussein that cast doubt on the Bush administration’s original justifications for the war, Mr. Nixon says, were ignored by senior officials at the C.I.A. and the White House. “The policy makers at the White House and the leadership on the seventh floor at the C.I.A. didn’t want to hear that many of the reasons for going after Saddam were based on false premises,” he writes.

Mr. Nixon’s most scathing criticism is reserved for the C.I.A, which he describes as a haven for yes-men excessively eager to please the White House. When he joined the C.I.A., Mr. Nixon says, he was told that analysts should “dare to be wrong” — in other words, be willing to take chances when the evidence called for counterintuitive reasoning. But he says experience taught him that the C.I.A. didn’t really reward out-of-the-box thinking. “As I found out in the Clinton, Bush and Obama years, the agency’s real operating principle was ‘dare to be right.’”

Mr. Nixon, who left the C.I.A. in 2011 when, he says, the work no longer excited him, depicts a sclerotic agency not much different from the Agriculture Department or any other large bureaucracy, complaining that the agency “was governed by lines of authority that were often clogged by people who got ahead by playing it safe and who regarded fresh thinking as a danger to their careers.” Since he had to submit the book to the C.I.A.’s censors, he doesn’t identify the stultifying bureaucrats and timeservers, although he does reserve special wrath for one boss he names only as “Phil,” who, he says, “as a schmoozer, had few equals.”

Mr. Nixon thoughtfully argues that the C.I.A.’s overeagerness to please the White House has led to a serious degradation in the quality of its intelligence. Virtually the entire analytical arm of the C.I.A. is focused on quickly pumping out short memos on the issues of the day that are immediately read at the White House. But the agency has largely abandoned its tradition of freeing up analysts to engage in deeper, long-term research. As a result, Mr. Nixon writes, few analysts at the agency now know very much about anything. “Expertise is not valued, indeed not trusted.”

The C.I.A.’s brief memos have become like “crack cocaine for consumers of classified information,” Mr. Nixon says. It’s as if the C.I.A.’s analytical branch has been transformed from a college faculty into a cable news network.

The trend toward quick-hitting but shallow intelligence reports — which other former C.I.A. analysts have also criticized in recent years, particularly since 9/11 — makes the agency much more susceptible to manipulation and politicization, and to repeating the kinds of mistakes it made when it inaccurately concluded that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction."
48,False,The article does not suggest any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions the parents of the girl, Terry Poling and Jon Poling, who believe that the vaccines caused their daughter's autism.",True,The article discusses the vaccinations that the girl received and how they may have worsened her underlying condition.,False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,False,There is no mention of a pattern in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"The parents of a girl who won a government settlement described how their hearts were broken as they watched their healthy, red-haired toddler transformed into an irritable, odd-behaving child after she got several childhood shots.

“Suddenly my daughter was no longer there,” said Terry Poling, the girl’s mother, in a news conference Thursday. She and her husband Jon said their daughter Hannah, now 9, has been diagnosed with autism.

The government has agreed to pay the Polings from a federal fund that compensates people injured by vaccines. The amount of the settlement hasn’t been set yet. U.S. officials reject the idea that vaccines cause autism, but they say that in this case the shots worsened an underlying disorder that led to autism-like symptoms.

The Polings said five simultaneous vaccinations in July 2000 led to Hannah’s autistic behavior. She was about 18 months at the time.

U.S. health officials have consistently maintained that vaccines are safe, and the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that there was no change in that position.

“Nothing in any of this is going to change any of our recommendations” about the importance of vaccines for children, said Dr. Julie Gerberding. “Our message to parents is that immunization is lifesaving.”

In the Polings’ first appearance since their case became public this week, the Athens, Ga., couple acknowledged their legal case never got to the point where evidence was argued.

They called on the government to remove thimerosal — a mercury-based vaccine preservative — from all flu shots. Thimerosal has already been removed from other vaccinations given to children.

The Polings, accompanied by Hannah, said that as a toddler, their daughter was a bright child who could whistle on command. But almost immediately after the vaccinations nearly eight years ago, she became feverish and irritable. Then, her behavior gradually changed so she would stare at fans and lights and run in circles.

“It wasn’t like a switch being turned off. It was more like a dimmer switch being turned down,” Jon Poling said.

Rates of women who are opting for preventive mastectomies, such as Angeline Jolie, have increased by an estimated 50 percent in recent years, experts say. But many doctors are puzzled because the operation doesn't carry a 100 percent guarantee, it's major surgery -- and women have other options, from a once-a-day pill to careful monitoring.

• What stresses moms most? Themselves, survey says

Government health officials conceded that the vaccines exacerbated an underlying condition and that she should be paid from the federal vaccine-injury fund.

Autism advocates called Hannah’s case a “landmark decision,” although the Polings’ own attorney disputes that.

“This was not a court decision,” said Clifford Shoemaker, who is based in Vienna, Va. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conceded the case before the court was asked to make a determination, he added.

Government officials wouldn’t discuss why they conceded this particular case, but said people with pre-existing injuries can obtain compensation under the program if they establish that their underlying condition was “significantly aggravated” by a vaccine.

Medical and legal experts say the narrow wording and circumstances probably make the case an exception — not a precedent for thousands of other pending claims.

“This does not represent anything other than a very special situation,” said the CDC’s Gerberding.

Hannah has a disorder involving her mitochondria, the energy factories of cells. The disorder — which can be present at birth from an inherited gene or acquired later in life — impairs cells’ ability to use nutrients. It often causes problems in brain functioning and can lead to delays in walking and talking.

Experts argued over how common the disorder is, and by implication, how many other vaccine cases might be affected.

“Most children with autism do not seem to have a mitochondrial problem, so this association ... is probably relatively rare,” said Dr. Edwin Trevathan, a pediatric neurologist who heads the CDC’s birth defects center.

The United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, a Pittsburgh-based group that raises money for research, says there are more than 100 types of mitochondrial disease, and genetic tests can find only a couple dozen.

The Polings were exploring two theories about what happened to Hannah. One is that she was born with the mitochondria disorder and the vaccines caused a stress to the body that worsened the condition. The other was that the ingredient thimerosal caused the mitochondrial dysfunction, Jon Poling said.

Since 2002, the preservative thimerosal has been removed from shots recommended for young children, except for some flu shots."

Curtis was born, everything was normal -- at least from all appearances. He looked like any other baby, according to his parents Kenneth and Kimberly Curtis, and life was a picnic, they say. But when Morgan had just passed his second birthday, they were hit by a thunderous realization. Despite his happy demeanor and normal appearance, the couple's ""pink, chubby Michelin Man"" was diagnosed as being moderately autistic.

Autism: To many people, the word generates images of acclaimed Hollywood actor Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man -- a sort of idiot with sparks of genius, a savant. But the reality, Kimberly Curtis assures WebMD, is quite different. ""It's hard when they can't tell you how they are or what they are thinking,"" she says. ""It really varies from day to day.""

Autism is a disorder of brain development that is characterized by problems with social interaction, communication skills, a strict routine, and the need for repetitive behavior, such as swaying or watching the same video over and over again. There is no cure, but intensive education can help autistic children develop new skills. Unfortunately, these programs are expensive and can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $100,000 a year for a residential school setting.

But for parents with newly diagnosed children, these day-to-day challenges and expenses are not the only hurdles they must overcome. Often, parents of autistic children also must deal with the simple frustration of not knowing why their child is autistic.

For that reason, Congress has now ordered the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to investigate an alleged link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The IOM is a division of the National Academy of Sciences, an institution whose members serve as scientific advisers to Congress. Meeting this Thursday, Jan. 11, the IOM is charged with the task of looking at whether childhood vaccinations really do cause autism, or if there's another cause out there that hasn't been identified.

The IOM is then required to make a recommendation on what course of action U.S. health authorities should take in terms of recommending childhood vaccinations."

The statement, released on April 29, has uncovered that 11,034 have come back positive, while 1,415 have died from the virus.

Data from geographic information system ArcGIS states that the U.K.'s countries of Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales have amassed 161,145 cases of infection and, as of April 28, 21,678 deaths have been recorded across Britain.

The country’s lawmakers are looking to pass an emergency coronavirus bill, designed to give Scotland increased powers in protecting its 5.47 million citizens from COVID-19. Although many new regulations and laws passed by Members of Parliament in London are in force in the country, areas in which the government has devolved power require new Scotland-specific laws. This includes the courts, businesses and housing regulations.

The Scottish Government admits that there will need to be a ""significant adjustment"" to the operation of public services and businesses. To keep Scottish courts running and dealing with serious criminal trials, everyone from judges, solicitors and lawyers, the accused, witnesses and juries will be able to appear via video link.

The bill also gives renters of homes greater protection from eviction during the pandemic lockdown, with a new minimum notice period that landlords can give tenants of six months.

The Scottish Government sat for one day to pass the new bill at Holyrood in the Scottish city of Edinburgh, with extended voting times to allow lawmakers to practice social distancing while passing their votes.

After the bill has passed, Holyrood will be closed for several weeks to allow the pandemic to pass. The new legislation has a six-month limitation, after which politicians would need to vote to continue the new laws for another six months if necessary.

To assist Britain's National Health Service (NHS) in treating people hospitalized by COVID-19, a new medical facility, NHS Louisa Jordan — named after a First World War nurse — has opened in Glasgow. It has initial capacity for 300 coronavirus patients, with the option to expand to accommodate more than 1,000 people. The facility mirrors the new NHS Nightingale, a huge coronavirus-dedicated temporary hospital in the ExCel conference center in London.

As previously reported by Live Science, researchers at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute and Vaccine Group have begun recruiting 510 healthy 18-55 volunteers in an effort to locate a vaccine for COVID-19. A vaccine won't be ready for several weeks, the researchers said.

In a statement from Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman on April 1, Freeman said that she hoped that NHS Louisa Jordan would not have to be used, but that ""we must prepare for every eventuality.

On Monday, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) published its riff on that theory.

In a paper titled ""The green swan"" the Basel-based institution warns climate change could unleash ""potentially extremely financially disruptive events,"" that could trigger the next global financial crisis. To contain the fallout, the BIS is urging global coordination among central banks, regulators and supervisors including jettisoning backward-looking risk assessments models that are not fit for gauging the far-reaching consequences of climate disruptions.
• Thunberg's message to Davos: 'You have not seen the last of us'
• Climate change is the world's biggest risk, says WEF

The number of extreme weather events has quadrupled over the last 40 years. Only 44 percent of the financial losses caused by those types of events are now covered in the United States. In Asia, it's just 8 percent and in Africa, only 3 percent.

""I think we might be on the brink of observing something that might be behind the next systemic financial crisis,"" Luiz Awazu Pereira Da Silva, one of the paper's main authors, told reporters.

If the more extreme climate scenarios start to play out, central banks, having played a vital role in the financial crisis, might be asked to step in as the ""climate rescuer of last resort"".

""There is no silver bullet,"" Pereira Da Silva cautioned. ""Central banks are not going to save the world again.""

In a forward to the book, the head of France's national central bank, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, added that climate change needed to be part of all economic and forecasting models.

The book said current regulation based on capital requirements for banks will not be able to mitigate the catastrophic effect of climate change on the financial system.

New policy mixes are needed instead, involving governments, central banks and prudential or capital requirements. But that would require unprecedented international coordination at a time when the global framework for finance is ""seriously compromised"", the book said.

Regulators monitor risks by using historical data and assumptions that are now ""largely irrelevant to assess future climate-related risks"".

Assessing the risks, therefore, requires a reset of the regulatory approach, which has already begun in the financial community with the development of forward-looking, scenario-based risk-management methodologies, the book said.

""Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to human societies, and our community of central banks and supervisors cannot consider itself immune to the risks,"" Villeroy de Galhau said."

Vice President-elect Mike Pence told CNN that Flynn ""is no longer associated with General Flynn's efforts or with the transition team and we're focused eyes forward."" The son of the retired officer had been helping his father with scheduling and secretarial work.

The announcement came on the heels of a controversial tweet the 33-year-old (pictured above with his father) wrote about an armed assault on a pizza restaurant in Washington over the weekend. A man named Edgar Maddison Welch was inspired to attack the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria by a viral fake news conspiracy theory called ""pizzagate,"" which claims the restaurant was a front for a pedophilia ring run by political elites, including Hillary Clinton.

Welch managed to fire off one round of his AR-15 in the incident but was arrested before he could injure anyone. Police found two other weapons amongst the man's possessions as he explained he had driven himself to the capital from North Carolina to ""investigate"" pizzagate on his own.

Despite the attempted violence, Flynn Jr. later wrote on Twitter: ""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story.""

He then retweeted numerous other users promoting fake stories about the popular restaurant.

Despite being a professed ""pro-life Democrat,"" Flynn's father was a keynote speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and was mentioned by several Republican hopefuls as a possible pick for national security adviser.

The retired lieutenant general served as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama from 2012 to 2014, but has since become critical of what he sees as a weakening of the US on the international stage due the president's policies. Flynn is no stranger to controversy, having accused Iran of helping plan the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Benghazi, Libya, without offering any evidence. He has also courted scandal by pressing for increased military cooperation with Moscow right after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014."

Those assumptions included the belief that Saddam was determined to preserve his extant WMD capabilities and acquire new ones. And now there were no weapons inspectors to hinder him. The inspectors had also been a moderating influence on Western intelligence agencies; the information they provided, and the mere fact of their presence in Iraq, helped those agencies stick to reasonable suppositions and keep unsubstantiated fears at bay. After 1998 many analysts increasingly entertained worst-case scenarios—scenarios that gradually became mainstream estimates.

Another element that contributed to faulty assessments before the 2003 invasion was Iraqi rhetoric. Imagine that you were a CIA analyst in June of 2000 and heard Saddam make the following statement: ""If the world tells us to abandon all our weapons and keep only swords, we will do that. We will destroy all the weapons, if they destroy their weapons. But if they keep a rifle and then tell me that I have the right to possess only a sword, then we would say no. As long as the rifle has become a means to defend our country against anybody who may have designs against it, then we will try our best to acquire the rifle."" It would be very difficult not to interpret Saddam's remarks as an announcement that he intended to reconstitute his WMD programs.

The final element in the context for our pre-invasion analysis involved discrepancies between how much WMD material went into Iraq and how much Iraq could prove it had destroyed. Before the Gulf War (and to a certain extent afterward) Baghdad imported enormous quantities of equipment and raw materials for WMD. The UN inspectors, with remarkable diligence, obtained virtually all the import figures, either from the Iraqis or from their suppliers. They then asked the Iraqis to either produce the materials or account for their destruction. In many cases the Iraqis could not. The difference between what they had imported and what they could account for was seen as important evidence of an ambitious clandestine WMD program. These are the numbers—of bombs, of liters of precursor chemicals, and so on—that the world regularly heard Bush Administration officials intone during the run-up to the 2003 war.

In hindsight there are legitimate reasons to question these numbers. According to David Kay, a number of Iraqi sources have told the ISG that some of the material that was unaccounted for was diverted from the unilateral destructions that took place from 1991 to 1996. However, it is not clear whether or not any of that material was destroyed later. And it is likely that some of the discrepancies between UNSCOM and Iraqi figures are no more than the result of sloppiness. Saddam's Iraq was not exactly an efficient state, and many of his chief lieutenants were semi-literate thugs with no understanding of esoteric technical matters and little regard for how things should be done—their only concern was that Saddam's demands be met.

The intelligence community's overestimation of Iraq's WMD capability is only part of the story of why we went to war last year. The other part involves how the Bush Administration handled the intelligence. Throughout the spring and fall of 2002 and well into 2003 I received numerous complaints from friends and colleagues in the intelligence community, and from people in the policy community, about precisely that. According to them, many Administration officials reacted strongly, negatively, and aggressively when presented with information or analysis that contradicted what they already believed about Iraq. Many of these officials believed that Saddam Hussein was the source of virtually all the problems in the Middle East and was an imminent danger to the United States because of his perceived possession of weapons of mass destruction and support of terrorism. Many also believed that CIA analysts tended to be left-leaning cultural relativists who consistently downplayed threats to the United States. They believed that the Agency, not the Administration, was biased, and that they were acting simply to correct that bias."

Moonshot to cure cancer? We’ve heard that before. Many times.

If the Obama administration’s moonshot to cure cancer sounds familiar — well, there’s a reason.

Presidents have been promising to do just that for 45 years.

Richard Nixon launched the metaphor that would not die way back in 1971, declaring that “the same kind of concentrated effort … that took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.”

Scientists then were just as skeptical as they are now, arguing that it’s inappropriate to call for a single, triumphal moonshot when cancer isn’t one disease but many. “We aren’t ready to start a countdown to an anticancer blastoff,” Philip Lee, then the chancellor of the University of San Francisco, told the Pittsburgh Press in 1971.

Nixon, of course, also invoked a “war on cancer.” Decades later, with the war still not won, the Clinton administration turned again to that militaristic metaphor.

“We want to be the first generation that finally wins the war on cancer,” then-Vice President Al Gore told the Toledo Blade in 1998. He said science was on the verge of a breakthrough: “For the first time, the enemy is outmatched.”

In the following campaign, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush returned to the space metaphor. He promised to “fund and lead a medical moonshot to reach far beyond what seems possible today,” to cure not just cancer but many ills associated with aging.

Sixteen years later, President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are launching a new effort.

“Research and therapies are on the cusp of incredible breakthroughs,” Biden wrote in a post in Medium this week. “The science is ready.”"

McConnell, as well as the donations made by George Soros to the Center for Popular Democracy.",False,There is no mention of a threat in this article.,True,"The article connects the incidents of women confronting senators and their connection to the Center for Popular Democracy, which has received funding from George Soros.",False,There is no mention of secrecy in this article.,"When Sen. Jeff Flake was accosted by two women in an elevator on Capitol Hill, it was seen as one of the most striking moments of last week’s Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination battle.

In the morning, Flake put out a statement indicating his support for Kavanaugh, but following the elevator incident, he made a dramatic call in the committee room for a one week delay so an FBI investigation could investigate sexual abuse allegations against the nominee.

Flake admitted afterwards that the elevator moment “certainly struck a chord” with him.

Just three days later, three women harassed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as he walked through the terminal at Reagan National Airport.

“How many stories of sexual violence do you need to hear in order to believe woman,” one of the woman asked McConnell during Monday's incident. Video shows McConnell looking straight ahead.

Seemingly organic, powerful protests. But in both instances, the women involved came from a nonprofit called Center for Popular Democracy that has received funding from liberal billionaire George Soros, records show.

Ana Maria Archila, who confronted Flake is the group’s co-executive director.

Tracey Corder, who according to reports, confronted McConnell, is the group’s racial justice campaign director.

Corder also confronted another Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee at the airport Monday.

“I know this is enjoyable to y’all,” Corker said, according to The Huffington Post. “Thank you so much. I appreciate it.”

The news outlet and other media reported that video showed Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., being confronted at Reagan by three women, including Center for Popular Democracy co-executive director Jennifer Epps-Addison.

Soros donated $1.5 million to Center for Popular Democracy in 2016 and 2017 through his philanthropy organization Open Society Foundations, the records show.

FLAKE SLAMS GOP, SAYS HE FEELS LIKE HE DOESN'T BELONG TO ANY POLITICAL PARTY

He also donated in the past two years another $1.2 million to the nonprofit’s sister organization Center for Popular Democracy Action, which helped organize protests at the Kavanaugh hearings in early September that resulted in more than 200 arrests.

A spokeswoman said Open Society Foundations “has long supported the work of the Center for Popular Democracy. The decision to discuss the Kavanaugh nomination with Sen. Flake was obviously a deeply personal one, and Ms. Ana Maria Archila has explained her thinking and motivations for doing so; the decision was entirely independent of OSF’s support. That said, the foundations proudly support the right of all citizens to make their voices heard by their elected representatives—a bedrock principle of our democracy that surely Fox News believes in as well.”

Soros also has ties to a liberal group running anti-Kavanuagh TV ads focused on his accuser Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations. Demand Justice is funded by a nonprofit Sixteen Thirst Fund that has received more than $730,000 from the Soros foundation in 2016 and 2017.

Video of McConnell being confronted was posted on Twitter after being shot by Ady Barkan, a Center for Popular Democracy staffer.

The Center for Popular Democracy did not return a Fox News request for comment.

""He is subject to these kind of protests -- these crazy protests -- all the time on immigration and other issues,"" McEnany said. ""As he said with the immigration protests, this is not about persuasion, this is about intimidation.”

Last week another Senate Republican, Ted Cruz of Texas was forced to flee a Washington restaurant Monday night in a scene caught on video.

One of the groups claiming credit for chasing Cruz was the Antifa group Smash Rascism DC. Reports show members of a union and three other groups took part. None have been linked to Soros.

The activists say they will continue to confront Republican lawmakers as the FBI investigates accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh when he attended a prep school and Yale.

Kavanaugh denies the allegations and has accused Democrats of trying to destroy him.

Archila and the other woman who stopped Flake pleaded with him not to support Kavanaugh’s nomination, describing their own experiences as sexual assault victims.

MICHAEL GOODWIN: KAVANAUGH HEARINGS ARE A NATIONAL DISASTER - AND THE WORST IS YET TO COME

On Monday, Flake told a conference in Boston that the incident was a factor in his request for an FBI probe before a full Senate vote on Kavanaugh.

“That experience, as well as a lot of others,” Flake said. “I got calls and emails and texts from women I never thought I’d hear from in this regard saying: ‘Here’s what happened to me when I was young, here’s what happened to me 30 years ago.’”

Eradicating these people, especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders, as was done in Somalia just now, is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace. Somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical Islamic threat. Only a fool loves war, but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him.

The now largely forgotten ""siege of the embassies"" is vividly recalled in a series of stiff upper lip dispatches from Michael Weston contained in government files newly released by the National Archives. Following the shock invasion of Kuwait by Saddam in August 1990, foreign embassies were given three weeks to transfer their operations to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.

But in a symbolic rejection of Iraq's claim to its oil-rich neighbour, some two dozen missions refused to budge, marking the start of a gruelling stand-off. The hold-outs quickly found themselves cut off by the Iraqis, without electricity or running water and limited communications with the outside world. Those who ventured beyond their embassy gates risked being picked up and forcibly removed to Iraq. In early September, the Foreign Office was finally able to get through to Mr Weston and his remaining colleagues by means of a radio call with then foreign secretary Douglas Hurd.

He found the ambassador in ""good heart"" but concerned about the impact that the deteriorating conditions - with no air conditioning in the sweltering desert heat - would have when it eventually came time to leave.

The ""more ragged and smelly"" they were when they eventually left, Mr Weston warned, ""the greater the propaganda victory for Iraq"". A couple of days later he was able to send a telegram assuring the Foreign Office they should be able to last at least until September 24 - a month after the siege began - and revealing that they had even begun preparing for the celebrations when it was all finally over.

""Our food will certainly hold out 'til then and we should manage for drinking water, if we are careful,"" he said. ""We use very little other water since the swimming pool, though stagnant, is still usable for washing. We are all suffering from prickly heat and the insects and the lack of any fresh food. ""Looking ahead, we are busy bottling our pre-invasion vintage (both red and white) and brewing a special beer to commemorate the relief of the siege, whenever that may be."" Mr Weston admitted however that some of his diplomatic colleagues in other embassies were not proving so robust. ""Morale is more of a problem. None of my colleagues, except the French and Italian, understands why he is obliged to stay on, and they all blame the UK for putting pressure on their governments to keep them here,"" he said."

Residues of paranoia remain. Assembly Speaker Hammadi, for example, who received his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Wisconsin, cannot conceal his distrust of the United States. ''We'd like to see America tighten the screws on the free market to prevent Iran from buying oil and getting arms,'' he says. ''I think it has that much power. But then, maybe the U.S. evaluates that Iran will be in the Western orbit in the long run.''

Iraqi officials insist the restoration of diplomatic relations is a ''normal'' step, a balance to its longstanding relations with the Soviet Union, which supplies most of Iraq's military equipment.

Once critical of the United States for its support of Israel and its reluctance to abandon Iran even after the revolution, Minister Aziz now speaks at length about his satisfaction with America's efforts to stem the flow of arms to Iran and its public recognition that Iraq wants peace.

''We grew up; we matured as politicians,'' says Aziz. ''This does not mean a change of view.''

In his office in Baghdad, Aziz, the ringmaster of Iraq's delicate balancing act, maintains the trappings of the revolutionary. He has hung up the conservative gray suits he donned during high- level talks in Washington last fall and is back to wearing his familiar green fatigues and toting his favorite ivory-handled pistol.

Aziz talks about reconciliation with Egypt, Iraqi's old foe, and says that Iraq has shed its paternalism toward the Palestinians. If that is maturity, it is more a result of the harsh reality of the war and a regional imbalance than any new peace initiative. Iraq remains more concerned with how to balance the Syria-Libya-Iran axis than with how to join Egypt in a search for peace with Israel. Only a few months before Iraq invaded Iran, it unveiled a pan-Arab charter for the decade, rejecting any superpower military presence in the Middle East, North Africa and the Indian Ocean, and charting a course of regional nonalignment.

Iraq is betting on the short memory of the United States. Will anyone remember that Iraq is the same country that sheltered and gave direct aid to Palestinian extremists for years? That Iraq was one the leaders of the ''rejectionist'' Arab nations that refused to countenance any diplomatic arrangements with Israel? That some Iraqi leaders even called for other Arab nations to use the oil weapon and to withdraw their funds from American banks after the 1981 Israeli bombing of its nuclear reactor at Osirak?

No one in Iraq would admit it, but the person most responsible for the current United States-Iraq honeymoon is the Ayatollah Khomeini. If it weren't for his intransigence, the war might have ended a long time ago, Iraq's economy would be back on its prewar track and its vision of itself as the leader of the Arab world revived.

Nothing will change on the war front until Khomeini dies and the shape of the Iranian revolution changes. The wish for Khomeini's death is expressed openly and often. As I was leaving the country, one minister shook my hand, wished me a Happy New Year and said: ''You are welcome again. And may Khomeini die soon.''"

The statement comes on the heels of California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s call for non-essential businesses to shut down effective immediately, and applies to all performers who are shooting with partners who are “not a part of their household.”

According to FSC spokesman Mike Stabile, the call for a moratorium is “just preemptive.” “The Governor and public health authorities have called for shuttering all non-essential businesses, so we’re doing what we can to flatten the curve,” he tells Rolling Stone. “We haven’t had a COVID-19 case we know of anywhere in the adult community.”

This is not the first time that the adult industry has issued a temporary hold on shooting. The industry last issued a one-week moratorium in 2018, after an adult male porn performer tested positive for HIV (he was later found to have contracted the virus off-set).

Porn performers are required to test for STIs every 14 days to curb the risk of on-set transmission, and Stabile notes the testing system will continue during the shutdown. “This isn’t a typical production hold, where we’ve identified a specific threat to the performer pool and are working to isolate it,” he says. “This is the adult industry responding to public health authorities and working with society at large to … protect vulnerable populations and our health care system.”

Yet as Rolling Stone previously reported, adult performers are independent contractors, meaning that they typically do not have health insurance or paid sick leave should they become ill. Like many other independent contractors in other industries, COVID-19 could have a tremendous impact on their finances, forcing them to find other means of income if they are unable to shoot.

Fortunately, many performers already have alternative forms of revenue, such as camming and making custom content for fans. “We’ve been encouraging this from the beginning, and expect we’ll see a shift in this regard,” says Stabile, adding that several companies have offered to help on-board or promote porn performers who wish to move over to those platforms in lieu of shooting. “This is an unprecedented situation, and like all industries, we’re going to have to find a way through this, and help our performers and producers survive,” he says.

Yet it remains to be seen whether everyone who is reliant on income from shoots alone will adhere to the call for a voluntary shutdown. The backlash to the adult industry shutdown is already taking place on social media. “Wow talk about over reach [sic]. This should be a performer choice,” reads one reply, while another says, “Fuck @FSCArmy.”"

No link has been found between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and a mercury-containing compound known as thiomersal that is used in some vaccines. Nevertheless, since 2000, thiomersal has been phased out of most paediatric vaccines in the US. Now a report published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that, despite this, the prevalence of ASD has continued to grow.

The data, from 13 areas in the US, reveal that in 2008, 11.4 kids aged eight per 1000 had an ASD compared with 6.4 per 1000 in 2002 – a 78 per cent increase. “Since the [latest data] came from kids who had vaccines [largely] without thiomersal, this factor plays no apparent role in the increased rates of the disorder,” says Emanuel DiCicco-Bloom of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, New Jersey, who was not involved in the study.

“Increases are likely to reflect better awareness of the condition,” says Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, UK."

According to NHS England, patients between 52 and 98-years-old died in the past 24 hours.

No new deaths were announced in Scotland today, with the death toll remaining at 2,482. It's the first weekday with no registered fatalities from the deadly bug since March.

• Air bridges are expected to be signed off in a crunch meeting today
• All kids should face the front in class to stop coronavirus spreading, the Education Secretary has advised
• The R rate remains below 1 in England

It comes as police warned pubs could face a ""month of New Year's eves"" with violence and drunken disorder when the lockdown lifts.

After four months without drinking in pubs, forces said they were ­bracing themselves for “two weeks of New Year’s Eves” when doors open on July 4.

They expect drunken violence and disorder to breakout on what has been dubbed “Super Saturday”.

Police believe social distancing rules which mean many people won't be allowed in pubs will cause tensions to flare up if drinkers are turned away at boozer doors.

Before the lockdown was brought in forcing pubs and bars to close, Brits ignored social distancing warnings and flocked to their local to have one last hoorah with friends.

People will have to follow strict rules on how the behave once they are inside pubs as well - including no dancing, no hanging out at the bar to order drinks, keeping raised voices down, and abiding by a ""one-in-one-out"" rule in toilets.

And Downing Street has warned of a fresh lockdown after people swarmed to beaches this week on the hottest day of the year.

Sunseekers ignored signs pleading: “Too busy? Head home!” and caused chaos as the heat hit 33.4C.

Boozy brawls broke out, coastal roads were gridlocked and sands strewn with litter.

There were similar scenes at Brighton, Margate in Kent, Camber Sands in East Sussex, and Southend, Essex.

Up to 200 sunbathers fought in front of families at Orcombe Point near Exmouth, Devon. Witnesses claim some were taking drugs.

Some virus limits are due to be lifted from July 4.

But following the mayhem, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “The PM and the government scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.

“If the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will look at having to reverse some of the easements we’ve put in place.”

Chief medical officer Chris Whitty added: “Covid-19 has gone down due to the efforts of everyone but is still in circulation.

“If we don’t follow the social-distancing guidance, then cases will rise again.”"

The dilemmas around how to define deceptive speech and how to check rank duplicity bedevil every modern capitalist society.

Past efforts suggest both key actions to consider and some cautions about how hard the task will be.

The most effective approach depends on a combination of meaningful self-regulation by the business community, innovative fraud policing and the willingness of political leaders and media elites to stand up for truthful public communication. At the moment, perhaps because of the extent to which Americans have come to disagree about what counts as “truth,” each of these requirements seems in short supply.

Anti-fraud efforts have an especially rich history in the United States, connecting such disparate topics as adulterated fertilizers, bogus patent medicines, and fly-by-night mail order firms, endemic investment swindles and bait-and-switch consumer advertising, and, more recently, telemarketing scams and misleading sales pitches for debt products like residential mortgages.

Every generation, Americans relearn that deceptive business practices not only harm investors and consumers, but also hurt honest firms and undermine broader economic confidence. What then to do about it?

One recurring impulse has been to deny the worst liars access to the marketplace. After the Civil War, the American Post Office Department invented the fraud order, which tackled the problem of deceptive long-distance marketing by denying allegedly duplicitous firms access to the mails. In the early 20th century, the new network of Better Business Bureaus began to circulate suggestions to newspapers and magazines that ads from especially dodgy marketers were “not in the public interest.” More recently, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have collaborated on Operation Chokepoint, which has denied sellers of bogus goods and services access to the online payment system.

The problem of fake news has prompted analogous countermeasures, this time implemented by social media companies like Facebook FB, and Google GOOG, GOOGL, . These companies have banned the producers of phony news accounts from using their online advertising services.

Efforts to cast out commercial fabricators from the marketplace have the big advantage of immediate, quick impact. But America’s history of anti-fraud regulation suggests important limitations as well. There is the whack-a-mole problem, since cheats and deceivers often respond to fraud orders and similar tactics by relaunching businesses under different names.

Such summary modes of dispensing justice also clash with American commitments to the rule of law, and so prompt complaints about exercises of raw power that seem more consistent with autocratic regimes. Faced with such critiques, most anti-fraud agencies eventually create procedural protections against unfair treatment: notice of impending bans from access to the marketplace, access to incriminating evidence and an opportunity to mount a defense through formal hearings.

The resulting reforms (in the 1910s and 1920s for mail fraud orders, in the 1950s and 1960s for Better Business Bureau recommendations that media outlets shun specific advertisers) made anti-fraud enforcement fairer. But they did so at the cost of slowing down enforcement actions and diminishing their effects.

The history of American anti-fraud policing suggests there is no magic bullet to the endemic problem of deception in the marketplace or the public square. Criminal prosecutions of the worst offenders can make a difference, though constitutional protections for free speech and the global reach of the internet complicate this potential means of curbing fake news.

Well-conceived public education may be even more important, whether undertaken by government agencies, NGOs or the media. Another emerging strategy to curb bogus news emphasizes this approach. The idea is to rely on crowdsourced tagging on social media of stories as “disputed,” along with work by journalistic gatekeepers to adjudicate such allegations.

Read:The next conversation about fake news needs to be this one

As this example suggests, we will never escape the need to invest trusted arbiters with the authority to label some deceptive practices as illicit. And unless we are willing to tolerate draconian regulatory actions, we will never banish duplicity entirely from our economic or political life.

Our best option is to tailor laws and design institutions with the goal of containing fakery and fraud, an objective that depends as much on the operation of social norms and shaming techniques as it does on formal penalties and the cultivation of savvier consumers of products, investment pitches and news.

This approach is far from perfect. But it can limit the impact of deceitful speech, and so the corrosive threats to our economy and our democracy.

Bush. Republicans counter that the midterm elections will be a referendum on the success of current President Barack Obama, and not on former President Bush. 



Members of the House of Representatives have already left Washington, D.C. to return to their home districts for the August recess, and senators are set to leave at the end of this week. Lawmakers from both parties are already testing out their campaign messages, to see how they will play with voters back home. President Obama may have signaled the strategy Democrats will favor. Speaking at a political event in Atlanta, Georgia, Mr. Obama said Republicans under former President George Bush were the ones who had driven the U.S. economy into the ditch [decline], and now they are asking voters to put them back in charge.



""They have not come up with a single, solitary new idea to address the challenges of the American people,"" said President Obama. ""They don't have a single idea that is different from George Bush's ideas, not one. Instead they are betting on amnesia. That is what they are counting on, that you all forgot.""



Senator John McCain of Arizona was the Republican presidential nominees who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Obama for the White House in 2008. Speaking at a news conference on Capitol Hill Tuesday, McCain told Mr. Obama to stop blaming everything on former President Bush. 



""Look he can keep [saying] BIOB, no matter what it is, blame it on Bush, he can keep that up,"" said John McCain. ""The American people are going to hold him accountable this November, not an administration that went out of power over a year and a half ago.""



Senator McCain also criticized President Obama for, as McCain described it, taking credit for American military success in Iraq. McCain pointed out that Mr. Obama opposed the Bush surge policy of deploying more troops to Iraq back when Obama was a senator running for president. McCain said Mr. Obama was, in his words, so small-minded that he could not give a moment's credit to George W. Bush for success in Iraq. In a speech earlier this week, President Obama reaffirmed that the U.S. is pulling all of its combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this month, saying the withdrawal is as he promised and on schedule.



Analyst Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia says that Democratic candidates have just begun to use the strategy of telling voters that Republicans will take them back to the failed policies of former President Bush, and will likely step up this line of attack as the elections get closer.



""They believe that if they can remind people that this election is not simply a referendum on Obama, but a choice between Obama and the Bush Republicans, that the Democrats will do much better,"" said Larry Sabato.



Sabato said the campaign tactic of targeting an unpopular President from the other political party has plenty of precedents in American history.



""The Democrats including [former Presidents] Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman ran against [former President] Herbert Hoover for decades,"" he said. ""The Republicans ran against [former President] Jimmy Carter for decades. Certainly an unpopular president like [former President George] Bush is good for at least a few elections."" 



Analysts say Democrats are likely to face electoral losses in November, since the party that holds the White House traditionally loses seats during the first midterm elections after a presidential race. And this time around, unemployment is hovering around ten percent across the country and the economy is still in uncertain waters. With public opinion polls showing that President Obama's public approval rating is slipping, Republicans running in House, Senate and gubernatorial races may seek to tie their Democratic opponents to Mr. Obama."

If enough people are immunised, immunisations can also stop pathogens infecting whole populations. This is called herd immunity.

There are also risks to having immunisations. For instance, some people suffer from a mild reaction to the vaccine .

In recent years there has been much controversy surrounding the MMR vaccine. Some people used to think the vaccine - which is a combined treatment against measles, mumps and rubella - could cause autism in children. They decided not to risk letting their child have the vaccine and hoped they would not catch measles, mumps or rubella.

But this meant that, as fewer and fewer children were immunised, the three diseases began to spread more easily and the number of cases began to increase. More recent studies by the World Health Organisation have shown that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Immunisations can never be completely safe and there is always a risk of some side-effect. So, when making a decision, these are some of the factors that need to be considered:
• None when fewer people are immunised, the number of cases of the disease increases
• None the chance of falling seriously ill or dying from the disease may be far greater than the chance of experiencing a serious side-effect
• None using a vaccine may be much cheaper than treating a very ill person"

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a significant genetic component: there is increased risk of ASD in the siblings of affected children. The controversy around MMR vaccine and autism has resulted in some parents delaying giving MMR vaccine to children who have an older sibling with ASD. An ingenious retrospective US study studied the rate of ASD in younger siblings of children with ASD, comparing those who had or had not received MMR vaccine.1 A health plan database was searched for children enrolled from birth to at least 5 years old who had a continuously enrolled older sibling. The prevalence of ASD in children with older siblings was 1.0% (994 of 95 727). Of the 95 727 children with at least one older sibling, 1929 (2.0%) had an older sibling with ASD. The younger sibling of a child with ASD was less likely to have received at least one dose of MMR vaccine than other children (73% vs. 84% at 2 years and 86% vs. 92% at 5 years). MMR vaccine was not associated with ASD in the younger siblings of children with ASD. Indeed, there was a trend towards MMR vaccine being protective: the relative risk of ASD for one dose of MMR vaccine at 2 years was 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–1.20) and for two doses compared with none at 5 years was 0.56 (95%CI 0.31–1.01)."

It presents academic research to unmask those responsible for what Corder has found to be insidious, century-long plot by the elite cabal to undermine the founding principles of the United States of America. The book also describes what average citizens can do to resist their efforts to ""destroy our civilization.""

""In this book, you will learn how divisive rhetoric and emotionally charged propaganda are presenting direct threats to our civil liberties, and how blatant attacks on patriotism, Christianity, and the U.S. Constitution are erasing our national identity,"" Corder says. ""You will also discover how deadly drugs, mass immigration and socialist policies are all being promoted to weaken us as a nation — to destroy our people by bringing chaos and disorder to our lives and our communities and you won't get these explosive truths from the mainstream media, or anywhere else.""

The publication of ""War for Your Worldview: What Every American Needs to Know in the Age of Fake News, Social Engineering, and Mind-Controlling Propaganda"" reminds readers that the war is real and that it is being waged through the manipulation of their minds. However, they can conquer evil with the power of knowledge, common sense and by remaining true to their founding principles.

U.S. forces found Hussein hiding in a ""spider hole"" in the ground near his hometown. He was arrested, and in 2006 was sentenced to death for the murder of 148 Iraqis in 1982, a massacre he ordered in response to an assassination attempt. [Top 10 Battles For Control of Iraq]

On Dec. 30, 2005, Hussein was led to the gallows at Camp Justice, northeast of Baghdad. Leaked cellphone video reveals that Hussein was vocal as he went to his death, talking back to hecklers, defending himself as a savior of Iraq and calling for Iraqis to fight off the Americans. Hussein's body was buried in his hometown of Al-Awja.

Muammar Gadhafi came to power in 1969 and kept an iron grip on Libya until 2011, when he fled Tripoli as it fell to rebels in the Liberian Civil War. His whereabouts were unknown for months, but it seems he had hunkered down in Sirte, his hometown, with a loyal inner circle. As Sirte fell on Oct. 20, Gadhafi and his retinue tried to escape in a convoy, which was bombed by NATO forces.

Gadhafi hid in a roadside drainage pipe, where Libyan forces found him. What happened next is up for some dispute. Initial reports suggested that Gadhafi was killed accidentally in crossfire, but that version of the tale doesn't seem to hold up to evidence, according to a 2012 Human Rights Watch report. Cellphone videos reveal Gadhafi alive and bloodied in captivity, being dragged, beaten and poked with a bayonet or knife. At some point, he was shot in the head. His body was put on display in a freezer in the city of Misrata for several days.

Like his father Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il ruled his country for years before succumbing to a heart attack. Kim presided over a horrific famine that killed hundreds of thousands to millions of North Koreans. The 69-year-old was reportedly traveling by train in 2011 when his heart felled him; he had previously suffered a stroke. [7 Strange Cultural Facts About North Korea]

The cult of personality that surrounds North Korean leaders was in full force after the death, with the North Korean state news agency reporting that the sky glowed red over Mount Paektu, a sacred site, at the moment of Kim's death. At the same time, ice on nearby Lake Chon was said to crack so loudly that heaven and Earth heard."

Well, I have news for Weigel.

To non-Catholics, the majority of us, the Pope’s claim that he speaks with the voice of God is outrageous. He may be a kind and decent man, but he is no more than that. He is a man. Elected to office by other men. Catholic women, a great many of whom are pro-birth control, had no say in his election.

As for Weigel’s claim that our President’s stance on population control is dictatorial, this is arrogance on a monumental level. It is the Catholic Church’s dictum on birth control that is dictatorial. “Increase and multiply” is bringing this planet to ruin and if allowed to continue will starve the world back to the Dark Ages.

Clinton is right. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church are dead wrong on this issue.

Weigel’s commentary (“A Deep Split Between the U.S. and the Vatican”) was mistitled. The real split on population policy is between the Vatican and virtually everyone else, including population experts, governments, global health advocates, and citizens of every nation who care about democracy and autonomy--not to mention practicing Catholics, who overwhelmingly reject the church’s teachings on birth control, and who do not believe in imposing narrow church doctrine on the rest of the world.

Contrary to Weigel’s assertion, the draft document for the Cairo conference is not “bitterly contested” except by representatives of the Holy See and a very few fundamentalist regimes. All other delegates are united behind the draft’s realistic, compassionate and empowering approach to improving women’s status, protecting individual rights, and expanding access to reproductive health care. To describe this consensus with shrieking epithets like “soft totalitarianism,” “eugenic fevers,” and “a truly Orwellian move” is preposterous.

Weigel says it’s a tragedy that Bill Clinton won’t kowtow to what he calls “the world’s greatest moral authority.” Never mind his offensive chauvinism and the fact that millions of people seek moral authority elsewhere. Never mind that poll after poll shows that even most Catholics feel the Pope doesn’t speak for them on matters of reproduction. The real tragedy would be if a politically motivated cadre of religious radicals succeeded in derailing the most progressive and promising approach to population in history. Fortunately, the collective conscience of women’s and population advocates worldwide will not allow that to happen.

I just wanted to applaud you for publishing Weigel’s politically incorrect, but penetratingly sound article. Weigel’s point--that the Western World is arrogantly and immorally exporting the failed notions of its sexual revolution to the Third World--gets little play in the big media. Thanks for giving it some."

Charles Schumer, Rep. Brad Sherman, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.",True,"The article discusses the details of a bad bank concept, executive compensation limits, talks on the bad bank idea, pricing of assets, government guarantees and insurance on troubled assets, capital injections, and the use of TARP funds.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,"The article connects events and actions related to the bad bank concept, government guarantees and insurance on troubled assets, and capital injections.",False,The article does not suggest any secrecy.,"The Obama administration is still struggling with the details of a bad bank concept that is expected to be part of a package of industry and consumer measures to be unveiled next week, according to a source familiar with the situation.

What’s likely to be unveiled Wednesday on executive compensation limits, may not be as tough as expected, according to an industry source, who played down its impact.

“They’re still trying to solve the bad bank [pricing] thing,” an industry source said. “It’s not ready for prime time.”

When asked if that could lead to a delay in next week’s announcement, the source said, “Anything they roll out would seem hollow without a bad bank concept.”

Representatives of the Obama administration and the financial services industry capped three days of talks on the bad bank idea and other measures to ease the credit crunch Sunday, following speculation Friday that the pricing issue had become a major hurdle.

Another source—this one on Capitol Hill—didn’t believe a decision had been made as of Tuesday.
• TARP Executive Pay Limits to Be Set at $500,000

The bad bank concept—namely a government entity to buy, hold and eventually sell bad, or toxic assets, from financial firms to help clean up their balances sheets and spur new lending—has attracted growing support since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke proposed it in a major speech three weeks ago.

Nevertheless, it has been dogged by debate and doubt over how to price the assets, which some estimate could total $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion and which fall into two broad categories—non-performing and illiquid.

Like with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s plan for an auction process to absorb the assets, the big challenge has been how to find a happy median between what the government is willing to pay and what firms are prepared to sell for, especially given the assets’ depressed value in the current market.

The bad bank concept is one of several options under consideration by the Obama administration. Apparently, there is currently sufficient support to continue the previous administration’s capital-for-equity plan, as well as the recently implemented “ring fence"" concept.

Somewhat similar to the bad bank concept, it involves government guarantees and insurance on troubled assets which stay on the firm’s book. The Fed and FDIC recently used such as approach with Citigroup and Bank of America . Similar to the bad bank concept, it involves government guarantees and insurance on troubled assets which stay on the firm’s books. The bad bank concpet actually removes the assets from the institution's books. Both measures are meant to clean up firms' balance sheets and spur new lending.

It’s also unclear how much support the bad bank concept—and indeed more aid to financial firms in general—has among Democrats in Congress, where the party holds sizable majorities.

Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), asenior member of the Senate Banking Committee, Tuesday joined the skeptics, telling CNBC the bad bank approach would be ""hugely expensive"" and added he prefers government guarantees of such assets.

Rep. Brad Sherman (D.Calif.), a ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee who opposed the original TARP plan, is adamantly opposed to anything but capital injections, which he says give the government its best potential return on investment through preferred stock and warrants.

“I’m trying to get people to say we don’t buy toxic assets, we buy preferred stock,"" said Sherman. “With the ring fence or bad bank you know what you’re paying but would anyone know the value of what you are receiving?” Sherman has made his position known to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

Though the Obama administration does not need Congressional approval to use the remaining $350 billion of the original $700 billion in TARP approved last fall, sources on Capitol Hill say it will probably want to get their support in principle in the event new appropriations are needed to fund future government aid efforts. There’s already growing talk of a so-called TARP 2 or 3.

And that’s one reason why the issues of executive compensation and lending practices for firms taking part in the aid program are so intertwined with the advancement of new initiatives.

Congressional Democrats had made it clear to the new administration that they want significant government funding to aid consumer borrowers, small business and the housing industry, following their anger and disappointment over Paulson’s administration of the TARP program, which was seen as too generous to and too lenient on Wall Street firms."

Hundreds of people, mostly soldiers, have been reportedly killed in the fighting between rival armed groups since Thursday, raising fears of a slide back into all-out conflict in the five-year-old country. At least 272 people have died, a health ministry source told the Reuters news agency early on Sunday. ""Monday morning began much as Sunday morning began in Juba,"" Al Jazeera's John Hendren, reporting from the capital, said. ""Fighting began in Jebel, southwest of the city; there's also been fighting in Gudele, to the east of the city; and now there are mortar rounds being heard in the downtown area,"" he added. ""What this means is that the ceasefire government officials had talked about - the unilateral government-led ceasefire - has not been carried out.

""The members of the Security Council urged an immediate end to the fighting by all concerned and demanded that President Kiir and First Vice President Machar do their utmost to control their respective forces, urgently end the fighting and prevent the spread of violence,"" the council said in a statement on Sunday.

Expressing ""shock and outrage"" at attacks on UN compounds, which killed and wounded Chinese and Rwandan peacekeepers, the council also demanded that civilian sites be protected and warned that ""attacks against civilians and UN premises and personnel may constitute war crimes"".

Al Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York, said delegates expressed ""deep concern"" about the recent upsurge of violence in Juba and discussed ways to make the work of the 14,000 peacekeepers ""easier"" and ""safer"".

""Also discussed during the meeting was the impact on civilians, a large number of whom are reportedly sheltering in UN facilities,"" Hanna said.

More than 1,000 people fled to a UN compound in Juba as heavy fighting broke out, and two UNMISS sites in the capital were hit by small and heavy arms fire, the UN said in a statement.

Following a localised firefight between rival military factions on Thursday night in Juba, major fighting erupted on Friday outside the presidential compound as Kiir was meeting with Machar, a former rebel leader and currently first vice president. The fighting quickly spread throughout the city.

An Al Jazeera correspondent who was inside the presidential compound during that attack later saw bodies of soldiers on the lawn and reported that thousands of displaced residents were trying to find safety amid the chaos.

INTERACTIVE: How far has South Sudan come since independence?

Kiir and Machar both appealed for calm as the fighting engulfed parts of the city, and amid confusion as to whom exactly was responsible.

On Sunday, a day after the country reached the fifth anniversary of its independence, residents of Juba's Gudele and Jebel districts reported heavy gunfire near the barracks where Machar and his troops have their headquarters.

Gunfire was also heard from the area near the airport, which local sources said had closed.

South Sudanese Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth laid the blame for the fighting on opposition forces loyal to the vice president, Machar, while Taban Deng, the minister of mining, called for opposition forces to join a unilateral ceasefire.

""Our people have suffered so much, they don't need any more suffering even for a minute. This is a call to our generals in both armies that they should ceasefire immediately,"" Deng said at a news conference in Juba on Sunday.

Al Jazeera's Hendren said the violence meant ""that the hopes of peace were dimming"" in the country

""After another day of intense battles, the people of South Sudan await word on whether the next step is ceasefire or continued fighting,"" Hendren said.

South Sudan was founded with optimistic celebrations in the capital on July 9, 2011, after it gained independence from Sudan in a referendum that passed with close to 100 percent of the vote.

The country descended into conflict in December 2013 after Kiir accused Machar, his former deputy who he had sacked earlier that year, of plotting a coup.

Civil war broke out when soldiers from Kiir's Dinka ethnic group disarmed and targeted troops of Machar's Nuer ethnic group. Machar and commanders loyal to him fled to the countryside, and tens of thousands of people died in the conflict that followed. Many starved to death.

A peace agreement signed in August saw Machar rejoin the goverment and his forces re-enter Juba as the first step towards integration into a national army."

His letter to the Financial Times urging Russia to devalue sparked the whole emerging crisis of this summer.

He is currently in the UK to publicise his new book which has just been serialised in The Times.

On Monday, he warned that the UK would be left out of the development of the European Union by not signing up to the euro.

He warned that the pound would be vulnerable to international speculators if the UK did not join the single currency.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4's World at One, he said there should be some link made between the euro and the dollar before sterling joins up.

News Peg: In addition to Jones, the FDA sent warning letters this week to seven other companies that have falsely claimed to sell products that can treat or cure COVID-19. The companies include Idaho company Herbal Amy and televangelist program The Jim Bakker Show. The products cited included teas, essential oils (including CBD oil), tinctures and colloidal silver products. According to the FDA website, “currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19,” though several medications are in clinical trials.

Key Background: A 2018 profile of Jones in the German magazine Der Spiegel reports that two-thirds of Jones’ funding comes from selling his products. Though Jones has promoted conspiracy theories such as the false claim that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax, he gained legitimacy through his relationship with President Donald Trump, who has retweeted InfoWars tweets and appeared on Jones’ online show in 2015. Apple banned the InfoWars app from its store in 2018, and last month Google Play followed suit. Facebook and Twitter have also banned Jones from their platforms.

But its early decline against the greenback, which it is widely expected to challenge eventually as the world's reserve currency, continues to dominate the headlines. Moreover, the fact that euro coins and notes will not enter into circulation until 2002 has fuelled the feeling that its arrival is an overhyped non-event.

But away from the public eye, the euro is having an impact on corporate Europe, and more quickly than most commentators expected.

The new currency did not alter the way business is transacted overnight, but it has accelerated changes which were already under way as European firms belatedly respond to globalisation.

The surge in hostile take-overs - until recently an entirely alien phenomenon to continental Europe - the infusion of seed capital into high-tech start-ups and the quickening moves toward the establishment of a pan-continental stock exchange all owe something to the new currency.

The most dramatic and visible impact of economic and monetary union was provided by Deutsche Telekom's decision to aim at least half of its planned 10-billion euro share offering at small investors in the 11 euro-zone countries.

This is the first time any company has moved beyond its own borders to sell shares to individual investors and DT's chief executive Ron Sommer directly linked the move to the arrival of the euro. ""This approach breaks new ground in Europe and signals a new way forward at a time when European states are growing together within the framework of economic and monetary union,"" he said.

DT's move underlines a fundamental shift in thinking over the past few months. It was only a year ago that the Spanish telecoms group Telefónica pulled out of a planned cross-border sale to retail investors.

The euro's arrival has set in train a domino effect across corporate Europe which is forcing firms to abandon decades-old business practices.

While the single market prompted firms to rationalise their production, distribution, sales and marketing, the single currency is forcing them to rethink the way they finance and run their operations.

The euro is rapidly creating a giant single capital market, compelling companies to compete for funds on a Europe-wide basis and enabling financial institutions to be more selective in providing loans.

There is a long way to go, as Europe's financial markets are much more fragmented than almost any other sector. Barely one-fifth of financial assets in the UK, Europe's most open nation, are invested abroad, while the figure in Germany and France is under 5%.

The euro's arrival has allowed investors to select stocks in the 11 euro-zone countries without currency risks, freeing them to focus on corporate management, strategy, margins and profits. This in turn is forcing companies to improve returns by selling non-core businesses and contemplating mergers with - and take-overs of - rivals they would not have considered in pre-euro times.

The frenzied merger and acquisition activity of the first five months of the year, the growing popularity of share buy-backs and the increased emphasis on shareholder value is testimony to the influence of the new currency.

There is already evidence that monetary union has led to radical changes in the way companies raise finance, with an increasing number of firms switching from bank finance to bonds, following the introduction of the euro and the flanking fall in interest rates.

The volume of euro-denominated corporate bond issues in the first quarter of 1999 was seven times higher than in the same period last year. More significantly, the average credit rating of the corporate bonds bought by investors tumbled sharply after the introduction of the new currency, suggesting that they are less risk-averse.

Europe's corporate bond market trails way behind that of the US (at the beginning of the year it was worth around 150 billion euro compared with h1 trillion across the Atlantic), but the gap is sure to narrow.

The strong likelihood that low euro-zone interest rates are here to stay is forcing Europe's growing pool of high-worth professionals to seek more rewarding outlets to finance their retirement.

Many are turning to Europe's booming secondary stock markets such as Germany's Neuer Markt, which are providing finance for high-tech start-ups which previously relied on venture capitalists in the United States.

Germany, until very recently a no-man's land for equity capital, has seen a record 40-plus initial public offerings in the first four months of 1999.

The net inflow into European equity funds totalled h85 billion in 1998, nine times more than in 1996, with individual investors rather than pension funds fuelling the boom, according to Merrill Lynch. And lower transaction costs, the end of currency risks, price transparency and lower interest rates mean Europe can look forward to a US-style equity culture.

The successful launch of the euro has also accelerated plans to establish a pan-European stock market: the Frankfurt and London exchanges recently agreed to extend their bilateral talks to the Amsterdam, Brussels, Madrid, Milan, Paris and Zurich bourses.

With the euro less than six months old, it is too early to deliver a verdict on its impact. But there is no doubt that it has changed Europe's corporate mind-set.

It is hard to imagine Olivetti's audacious bid for Telecom Italia, the ferocious battle between Bernaud Arnault and François Pinault for Gucci, and the current rash of other hostile take-overs happening in the days before the single currency was launched.

The euro may eventually topple the dollar from its perch, but right now it is helping to 'Americanise' corporate Europe."

The actual number of AIDS deaths is difficult to determine. But it appears priests are dying of AIDS at a rate at least four times that of the general U.S. population, according to estimates from medical experts and priests and an analysis of health statistics by The Kansas City Star.

The deaths are of such concern to the church that most dioceses and religious orders now require applicants for the priesthood to take an HIV-antibody test before their ordination.

For the nation's 60 million Catholics, served by 46,000 priests, the AIDS issue goes straight to the heart of church doctrine, which teaches compassion and forgiveness but also considers homosexual relations a sin and opposes the modern practice of ""safe sex.""

In a nationwide confidential survey of 3,000 priests by The Star, two-thirds of the more than 800 responding lauded the church for being caring and compassionate to priests with AIDS. Often, the church covers medical costs, gives them a place to live and cares for them until they die.

Most priests, however, said the church failed to offer an early and effective sexual education that might have prevented infection in the first place.

""Sexuality still needs to be talked about and dealt with,"" said Rev. Dennis Rausch, a priest with AIDS who runs an AIDS ministry program for Catholic Charities in the Archdiocese of Miami.

""I've been trying to get into the seminary here for the last several years to do an awareness course for the guys, so when they come out, they at least have some knowledge.""

Moreover, by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the breaking of celibacy vows as shameful, the church has scared priests into silence, some say.

""I think this speaks to a failure on the part of the church,"" said Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of Detroit. ""Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn't know how to handle their sexuality, their sexual drive. And so they would handle it in ways that were not healthy.

""How to be celibate and to be gay at the same time, and how to be celibate and heterosexual at the same time, that's what we were never really taught how to do. And that was a major failing.""

American censors took exception to parts of the film, specifically scenes featuring sodomy between Saddam Hussein and Satan. Consequently, the film was substantially cut, and was given an R certificate, meaning those under the age of 17 have to be accompanied by an adult.

A Christian website, crosstalk.com, describes the film as “intentionally immoral, with the most vile content in the history of mainstream movie-making; 340 counted obscenities… 14 profanities and many disgusting bodily functions, including vomiting, bloody violence… extreme sex including homosexuality and paedophilia… this is a blasphemous, evil movie. EVIL.”

In the UK, the film has been granted a 15 certificate, allowing anyone over that age to see it unaccompanied, and not a frame was chopped.

A spokesman for the BBFC explained: “You can’t really generalise, but the Americans are very strict about sexual material above all else. We didn’t have a problem with anything in the film.”

Ironically, the film’s full title is South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut and pokes fun at the hypocrisy of most censorship regarding war, violence and sex.

Trey Parker, who together with Matt Stone create South Park, hit out at the current “climate of fear” in the wake of the Columbine massacre and the hypocrisy of the US censors, he declared: “It’s just scary – going through the trailer process and getting the notes back (from the censors) that say, ‘You just can’t fart.’ It’s like, the shot of the guy shooting the M60 and all these people getting shot – that was OK. But the guy farting has to go.”

The movie is released in the UK on August 27."

On the morning of June 17, 1972, five men were arrested after breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. The media, led by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, doggedly pursued the story, exposing wiretaps, secret documents, and hush money. President Richard Nixon denied involvement in the scandal, declaring, “I am not a crook,” in a nationally televised press conference. But the White House cover-up failed. Faced with almost certain impeachment, Nixon resigned from his second term in office on August 9, 1974.

The White Sox shocked the nation when they threw the World Series. Nearly a century ago, some members of the Chicago White Sox baseball team accepted a bribe—as much as $100,000 (about $1.4 million today)—to deliberately lose the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Suspicions arose in the first game after uncharacteristically sloppy pitching by the White Sox, who were heavily favored to win. “I don’t know why I did it,” pitcher Eddie Cicotte testified before a grand jury. “I must have been crazy.” He and seven other players, including “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, were indicted on nine counts of conspiracy but acquitted by a jury. They were banned from the game for life.

Many made claims to be the grand duchess of Russia, but all of them were frauds. It was a gruesome crime: In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries executed Russian tsar Nicholas II, the empress, and their five children. But did Anastasia, the youngest daughter, escape? Several impersonators exploited this hope, most famously Anna Anderson, an Anastasia look-alike who filed an unsuccessful suit in 1938 to try to prove her identity—and claim an inheritance. Anderson, who had supporters as well as detractors, died in 1984. A posthumous DNA test found she was unrelated to the Romanovs and appeared to confirm she was a Polish factory worker named Franziska Schanzkowska.

A famous swindler lends his name to a fraudulent scheme that still endures. In 1919 Italian immigrant Charles Ponzi built a pyramid scheme around international postal reply coupons. Ponzi, who brought in $250,000 a day at the peak of his scheme (about three million dollars today), conned investors into sending him millions of dollars, promising eye-popping returns. Ponzi’s scam—paying one investor with money from others—unraveled in August 1920, when he was charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. In 2008 modern-day Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff was arrested after bilking investors—including Steven Spielberg, Sandy Koufax, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Elie Wiesel—out of billions.

A gifted showman, P. T. Barnum exploited the public’s desire to be amazed. At his first spectacle, in 1835, showman Phineas Taylor Barnum touted Joice Heth as George Washington’s 161-year-old nursemaid. Crowds came gawking to see “the greatest natural & national curiosity in the world.” Barnum profited from the public’s hunger for entertainment by planting embellishments and lies in newspapers. His fabrication about Heth blew up after her death, when an autopsy found her to be no more than 80 years old. Barnum’s flair for fake news culminated when, in ill health, he arranged for the publication of his own obituary so he could read it before he died.

Piltdown man, a clever fabrication of a human ancestor, created a sensation. In 1912 fossil enthusiast Charles Dawson and his collaborator Arthur Smith Woodward, a geologist at the British Natural History Museum, announced the unearthing of humanlike skull fragments and an apelike jawbone from a gravel pit near Piltdown, England. Just a few years earlier, Dawson had written to Smith Woodward, saying he was “waiting for the big ‘find.’ ” But Piltdown man, initially hailed as the missing link connecting ape to human, was a fraud: The bones were stained to resemble ancient fossils, and the teeth, from an orangutan, had been filed down to appear human."

After effusively praising Barr after her reboot was an immediate ratings success, he was notably silent after her show was abruptly cancelled Tuesday following her shockingly racist tweet aimed at former Obama administration advisor Valerie Jarrett.

“Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?”

After the comedienne’s eponymous reboot premiered in March, Trump called Barr to congratulate her for her successful revivial, and thank her for a show “about us.”

“I called her yesterday. Look at her ratings! Look at her ratings!” Trump said in March while in Ohio to deliver a speech on infrastructure. “I got a call from Mark Burnett, he did The Apprentice. He’s a great guy. He said, ‘Donald, I called just to say hello and to tell you did you see Roseanne’s ratings?’ I said, how big where they? They were unbelievable. Over 18 million people. And it was about us.”

But since Barr’s Ambien-fueled Twitter rant began Monday night, Trump did not speak out — or tweet — about the cancellation until around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. He declined to bring it up during a Nashville rally Tuesday evening, although he did take time out to bash both Hillary Clinton and JAY-Z.

“The only way she [Clinton] filled up the arena was to get JAY-Z,” Trump told the crowd. “And his language was so filthy it made me look like the most clean-cut human being on Earth.”

Just hours before those comments, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders also dodged repeated questions about Trump’s reaction to Roseanne‘s cancellation, noting that he’s too “focused” on important issues to take time out to comment on Barr.

“Look, as you know, the president has been extremely focused,” she said, before ticking off priorities including North Korea, the economy and rebuilding the military. “That’s what he’s spending his time on; not responding to other things.”

“The president’s simply calling out the media bias,” she said. “No one’s defending what she said. The president is the president of all Americans and he is focused on doing what is best for our country.”"

On the tape, the speaker described the U.S. occupation of Iraq as the beginning of an occupation of Persian Gulf states for their oil and makes other references to events in the last few months.

A CIA official said a technical analysis of the audiotape compared it to samples known to be of bin Laden's voice and showed that ""it is likely him.""

Reacting to the CIA's analysis, a senior Bush administration official said, ""It is another reminder. There has been a lot of progress, but the war on terror continues.""

The voice on the tape called on Muslims to overthrow regimes in the Middle East that are working with the United States or participating in peace efforts with Israel.

The speaker referred to other recent events such as the December 1 launching of an unofficial peace plan by Israelis and Palestinians in Geneva, Switzerland, and the November 8 suicide bombing of a residential compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The bombing killed 17 people, most of them Arabs. A Saudi official said the blast had the earmarks of bin Laden's terrorist network.

""My message to you today is in reference to stressing the importance of the continuation of Jihad to fend off the conspiracies that have been and are still being plotted against our nation,"" the speaker on the tape said.

""Especially that now some of those conspiracies have become clear by way of the occupation of Baghdad by the crusaders and those heretics that are supporting them under the pretext of WMD [weapons of mass destruction].""

Unlike previous tapes attributed to the al Qaeda leader, the latest one began with the speaker stating that he is bin Laden.

He called on Muslims to form a council to run the Middle East and lead a jihad against governments in the region.

The voice said that ""it is imperative that those governments have to be brought down,"" because in working with the ""infidels"" they ""shed the blood of their brothers and sisters.""

Persian Gulf leaders, the speaker said, are not capable of defending the Islamic nation. ""There is no dialogue except with weapons,"" he said.

The speaker said the U.S.-led war in Iraq was part of a ""religious and economic war"" to control the Arab world. ""Today, Baghdad; tomorrow, Riyadh,"" he said.

In the first two of three segments on the audiotape, the speaker accused Americans of seeking to change the ""beliefs, values and curricula of the Muslims so that they become more tolerant as they claim.""

""Clearly put this is an economical and religious war. The occupation of Iraq is but an episode in the series of the Zionist and crusaders' campaign,"" he said. ""Then will come the total occupation of the rest of the countries of the Gulf in preparation to spread hegemony and control over the whole world.

""The Gulf and its countries is but the key to control the world in the view of the super powers due to the huge oil reserves.""

Citing the Geneva initiative and the ""road map"" for Middle East peace backed by the United Nations, European Union, Russia and United States, the tape called on Muslims to fight all efforts at achieving peace with Israel.

""If you don't take them on in Jerusalem, they'll take your two holy sites,"" the speaker said, referring to Mecca and Medina.

The previous tape likely containing bin Laden's voice aired October 18, U.S. officials said. The officials said references on that tape indicated it had been recorded at some point during the previous three months.

A senior U.S. official said the recent decision to put the nation on heightened terror alert was based on intelligence showing a risk ""for the holidays and beyond.""

""We are now into 'beyond,' "" the official said.

Administration officials decline to say how much longer they intend to keep the nation at alert level orange, the second highest point on the color-coded system. Some sources said information suggests a heightened level of risk for some weeks to come.

But finding a way to power these tiny robotic helpers is a challenge because clean, lightweight and compact fuel sources are hard to develop.

Now, a team of engineers from the East China Normal University in Shanghai may have found a solution: They've developed a chemical motor for lightweight robots that can glide along the surface of a body of water. The findings are described in an October study published in the journal Langmuir.

The chemistry-based minimotor works because of a phenomenon called the Marangoni effect, which describes what happens when two liquids with strong surface tensions interact. The most famous example of the Marangoni effect is the so-called ""legs"" that run down the side of a glass of wine after the liquid in the cup is swirled. Because of this effect, liquids slip and slide alongside each other instead of mixing together. [Biomimicry: 7 Clever Technologies Inspired by Nature]

The team from Shanghai found that concentrated droplets of a solution of polyvinylidene fluoride and dimethylformamide (PVDF/DMF) interacted this way when placed in water — instead of dissolving into the water, the droplet would sit on the surface and spin rapidly, not unlike a motor.

The team tested out the new chemical motor two ways. First, they put tiny lightweight paper rockets and paper goldfish into a petri dish of water and dropped some PVDF/DMF on their tails. The mock minibots immediately started zipping around the dish in wide circles as the droplet spun around like a propeller.

The scientists also tried to use a PVDF/DMF droplet to generate electricity. To do so, they placed a four-armed stirrer that was hooked up to an electromagneton top of a spinning droplet. As the stirrer whirled, it generated electricity. Because the chemical motor doesn't give off any pollution, the researchers said this sort of technology could lead to a new source of clean energy. But, as the arms of the stirrer cut through the water and the droplet, the surface tension of the water decreased, causing the PVDF/DMF ""motor"" droplet to disperse throughout the water and slow to a halt.

The new study was a so-called proof of concept, meaning that its main goal was to see if the idea worked. Indeed, the chemical motors aren't quite ready for industrial use, as the current version can propel a paper rocket for only a couple of minutes. But the scientists said they are optimistic that further exploration of the Marangoni effect could lead to a fleet of lightweight, energy-efficient aquatic robots skimming across the water."

The atlas, which dates back to the 19th Century, is the global reference book for observing and identifying clouds.

Last revised in 1987, its new fully-digital edition includes the asperitas after campaigns by citizen scientists.

Other new entries include the roll-like volutus, and contrails, clouds formed from the vapour trail of aeroplanes.

Since its first publication in 1896, the International Cloud Atlas has become an important reference tool for people working in meteorological services, aviation and shipping.

The first edition contained 28 coloured photographs and set out detailed standards for classifying clouds. The last full edition was published in 1975 with a revision in 1987, which quickly became a collector's item.

Now, embracing the digital era, the new atlas will initially be available as a web portal, and accessible to the public for the first time.

The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) publishes the atlas, and also has the final say on the contents, including the addition of ""new"" clouds and cloud features.

This time around 12 new terms have been added. The best known of these is asperitas, meaning rough-like in Latin, as the clouds can look like the tossing of the waves at sea when viewed from below.

These clouds were first recorded over Iowa in the US in 2006, but soon a torrent of similar images from around the world began to pour in to the Cloud Appreciation Society, a citizen science body.

They began to lobby the WMO for official recognition of the cloud type. But the fact that it has now been officially included came as something of a surprise.

""Back in 2008, I thought the chances of this becoming official were really minimal,"" said Gavin Pretor-Pinney, president of the society.

""At first the WMO were saying they had no plans to do a new edition, but over time I think they began to realise there is an interest among the public in clouds and there is a need for that interest to be an informed one, there's a need for this authoritative work.""

Asperitas becomes the first addition of a new recognisable term since 1953. In addition several other supplementary features of clouds have also been added including cavum, cauda (known as a tail cloud), fluctus and murus (known as a wall cloud).

In terms of the way the WMO classifies clouds, they have also added one new ""species"" - the volutus, or roll-cloud, a low horizontal tube-shaped cloud mass that appears to roll about a horizontal axis.

A key element in the evolution of the atlas has been the impact of technology. People all over the world are able to capture and exchange images on their smart phones of fleeting cloud formations.

""People don't have to be an official weather observer, they don't have to be schooled in the finer points of the International Cloud Atlas, they just go 'that's amazing' and take a picture and send it to us, and being in the centre of that network we can spot a pattern,"" said Gavin Pretor-Pinney.

The atlas also includes a recognition of the processes that can lead to cloud formation, so the clouds that arise from wildfires are now classified as flammagenitus.

Similarly patches of cloud that are formed over forests and over waterfalls are classified, but also one of the most widely seen features in the sky, contrails formed from the exhausts of airplanes, are given greater recognition.

""In the modern day you will look up to the sky and see clouds made by airplanes. Once they are made they can linger for days,"" said BBC meteorologist John Hammond.

""It's one example of how crucial knowledge of cloud physics is - it's not just an aesthetic, our knowledge of clouds is still fairly limited.""

The new atlas also recognises some weather features that not everyone might agree can be seen as clouds. These include rainbows, halos, snow devils and hailstones.

""There is a blurred edge between what is a cloud and what is a sheet of hail falling from the sky,"" said John Hammond.

""There are grey areas around the edge of this. All types of optical effects can be defined as clouds, be they halos or snow devils or rainbows, but I'm a little bit old-fashioned and I struggle with the inclusion of rainbows as clouds.""

Hammond believes that there will be many new entries in the future as long as the public remains engaged in the subject and he believes the opening up of the atlas via a web portal is a very good thing towards that end.

Gavin Pretor-Pinney from the Cloud Appreciation Society agrees that opening up the atlas is a huge positive.

""The value of the atlas is that it draws our attention to the sky and by learning the name of the formations, that is the way we pay attention to and value what we see around us.

""By giving a language to the forms of our atmosphere we are helping people to value our atmosphere and to pay attention our impact on it.""

Along with the rest of the world, bond guru Bill Gross has watched as negative interest rates unfurled in Europe and then took root in Japan.

He's not keen on their land grab, and in his latest monthly investment outlook, he compares their migration to Japan with the spread of the dangerous Zika virus.

Negative interest rates -- in which banks are charged interest to keep their money parked -- are an ""enigma"" to almost every investor on the planet, says Gross, who's scratching his head over the phenomenon like a lot of people.

""Why would someone lend money to a borrower with the certainty of getting less money back at a future date?"" Gross questions.

He continues: ""Several years ago even the most Einsteinian-like economists would not have imagined such a state but now it seems an everyday occurrence, as central banks plumb deeper and deeper depths like drilling rigs expecting to strike oil, if only yields could be lowered another 10, 20, 50 basis points.""

Negative interest rates pose a threat to banks, says Gross, since their profit margin is pressured when yield curves flatten and their net interest rate margin (the difference between what a bank makes on lending and pays on deposits) narrows.

If you ask Gross, battered bank stocks look more like they're ""permanently damaged"" by stricter regulations, massive write-offs and tighter margins and less like a ""screaming sector ready to be bought.""

Negative interest rates are also a menace to people who are trying to save or invest money for college, retirement or medical expenses, says Gross. It doesn't matter if you plunk your money in a bank or a Treasury bond, the returns are ""inadequate"" compared to what you could historically expect and what their risk level is.

Gross, who manages the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, has long complained about the monetary policy set by central banks around the world and their impact on yield.

Central banks have resorted to negative interest rates in an attempt to encourage banks to do more lending, which will hopefully spur economic growth. The Bank of Japan was the latest to join the bandwagon when it pushed interest rates below zero in January."

Just as FBI whistleblower Mark Felt called out Richard Nixon’s systemic criminality and Karen Silkwood disclosed the massive risks of nuclear power, so today whistle-blowers are explaining how Cambridge Analytica helped to corrupt our elections or how Big Pharma hooked our nation on opioids. In 2019, a whistleblower revealed startling facts about President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, triggering impeachment proceedings.

Whistleblowing is based on celebrated American ideals, such as the freedom of expression, the right and duty of citizens to warn of public wrongdoing, and the importance of the individual conscience. Pioneering whistleblower laws were passed by the Continental Congress in 1778, and by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, at the height of the Civil War.

Who should be TIME’s Person of the Year for 2019? Cast your vote in the reader poll.

But as important and effective as whistleblowing has become today, its rise is actually bad news for American society in the long term– a symptom of the breakdown of internal checks and balances on our corporations and our government. This current spate of high-level disclosures by whistleblowers coincides with the spread of cultures of secrecy, of outsourcing public goods and services to private contractors, of increasing normalization of conflict of interest and other unethical practices as clever business models, and the weakening of the very concept of public service itself. Watchdogs are disappearing, as regulators are captured, defunded or drowned out by lobbying, as local newspapers cut their staffs, and with fewer attorneys at the Department of Justice willing or able to prosecute white collar criminals. Corporate and government insiders realize that if they don’t speak out, no one will ever learn of the wrongdoing they see.

We publicly celebrate whistleblowers in the news and in films as heroes, but in real life we allow most of them to be permanently blackballed in their chosen fields. This two-faced view toward people with the rare courage to speak truth to power suggests why whistleblowing is so alarmingly easy to politicize. And since the basic currency of whistleblowing is a respect for facts and the rule of law, the act of whistleblowing, like democracy itself, is at hazard in today’s postfact world.

At the other extreme, some of Clinton’s defenders assert that the only connections between Watergate and the current matter are that the intern, Monica Lewinsky, has been residing at the Watergate and that Lucianne Goldberg, the literary agent who seems to be the source of some of the allegations, was a spy for the Nixon campaign in 1972.

From a historian’s perspective, the truth appears to lie between these extremes, but closer to the belief that the two scandals are not very much alike.

The similarities are obvious: In both cases there was the possibility that the president was involved in obstruction of justice. Both Nixon and Clinton made public declarations of innocence. Both attempted to divert attention to “more important” matters. Each made the claim that the charges against him were instigated by his political opponents. And there is the fact that a substantial number of Americans feel a visceral hatred for Clinton, much as many did for Nixon.

But the differences appear, at least at this point, to be much greater than these surface similarities. Much of the confusion stems from the unfortunate use of the term “Watergate” to describe the multifaceted wrongdoing of the Nixon administration. The name has left much of the public with the assumption that the Nixon scandal was about a single event, a “third-rate burglary” and the subsequent attempts to cover it up. This erroneous belief makes it easy to think that an alleged attempt to hide a sexual affair may be in the same league.

The fact is that the actions that led President Nixon to resign to avoid being impeached and removed from office went far beyond the break-in and bugging at the Democratic national headquarters at the Watergate complex in 1972.

An abbreviated list of what came to be subsumed under the catch-all name “Watergate” includes burglarizing the office of the psychiatrist of Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the secret Pentagon Papers; sending out a “mugging squad” to attack Ellsberg; using the IRS, the FBI, the CIA and other federal agencies to harass and intimidate political opponents; planning a break-in at the Brookings Institution; forging cable messages intended to implicate President Kennedy in the 1963 assassination of South Vietnamese President Diem; exchanging government favors for campaign contributions; “laundering” money raised through illegal contributions; concluding a series of real estate deals that made Nixon a millionaire while in office; arranging government-funded improvements on Nixon’s private residences; and infiltrating and sabotaging the campaigns of political rivals.

While obstruction of justice can be viewed as an issue in both cases, there is a huge difference between what Nixon was trying to cover up and what Clinton is alleged to be trying to cover up. In Nixon’s case, it was a long series of crimes that threatened the American constitutional system. What Clinton is accused of trying to hide, however sordid, is certainly not a threat to the Constitution. It is probably not even a crime. Perjury and subornation of perjury are, of course, crimes, but if Clinton were ever shown to have committed these offenses, these would be his only crimes. In Nixon’s case, numerous criminal activities of a wholly different and more serious type were involved.

Nixon’s were, unquestionably, the sort of “high crimes” referred to in the Constitution; can the same reasonably be said of the allegations against Clinton?

If all the things of which Clinton has been accused by his opponents — using political power for personal enrichment, misusing FBI files to obtain “dirt” on political opponents, paying off witnesses in exchange for silence, exchanging favors for illegal campaign contributions — were ever shown to be true, the Clinton affair might begin to approach the scope of Watergate. But all of that remains in the realm of speculation. Independent counsel Kenneth Starr has thus far been unable to make any of these charges against Clinton stick.

People in the news media do a disservice to the public’s understanding of history when they link events of vastly different magnitudes. Watergate was much more than “a third-rate burglary.” So far, we have no proof that the latest addition to Starr’s amorphous investigation was even a third-rate sexual affair.

Ex-Members Reveal Why They Left Church Where a Teen Was Killed – and Why They Believe It's a Mind-Controlling Cult

Former Word of Life Christian Church member Nathan Ames wasn’t the least bit surprised to learn of the Oct. 11, 2015, beating death of 19-year-old Lucas Leonard inside the insular congregation in Chadwicks, a small hamlet located just six miles outside of Utica, New York.

According to Ames, the Word of Life Christian Church – where nine congregants allegedly kicked, whipped, and punched Lucas and his 17-year-old brother, Christopher, who survived the merciless, 12-hour blitz – had lost its luster, transforming from a place of worship to a house of torment.

“There were a lot of good things that had been going on at the church, but it slowly and increasingly got controlling,” Ames, 26, tells PEOPLE. “People were being mentally abused over time and they’d become sheltered from the outside world as a result. It got to the point where, if you watched television, you shut the commercials off because you didn’t want any external influences.”

Ames, who claims to be working on a book about his experiences in the church, tells PEOPLE his parents decided to exit the congregation 13 years ago, soon after the death of its founder, Jerry Irwin.

“Obviously, people who didn’t accept the Irwins and what they were professing were ostracized from the pulpit,” Ames explains – noting that, once the church was left to Irwin’s descendants, it became much more restrictive. “We were told we couldn’t talk to anybody. You’d go to church, but you couldn’t talk to anyone. They’d use manipulation and mind games to control people.”

For more on the story of the Leonard family and the investigation into the Word of Life Christian Church, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.

In this week’s issue, PEOPLE delves deeper into the vicious alleged murder of Lucas Leonard, and goes behind the brick walls of the mysterious church to discover what life was like for its members.

“Normal churches are not like this,” Ames insists. “This is not what a real church is. It’s sad that people see this and think that’s what church is. I think it’s a cult simply because mind control was used, and because the Irwins made claims that they were the only way to heaven. People believed that.”

“I remember the Irwins yelling at people as they tried controlling every aspect of the members’ lives,” Handville tells PEOPLE. “They’d always have people working on various projects to keep them busy. That’s a mind control technique; they’d have people cleaning the church building or making repairs to it. I can remember church leaders telling wives their husbands had badmouthed them. They told husbands about their wives and turned kids against their parents. They fostered an environment of bitterness.”

The breaking point for Ames’ parents, he claims, came when church members were told they would need permission from church leaders to do just about anything.

“It got to a point where you couldn’t answer your phone,” Ames says. “You’d get a call from someone, but before you could pick up the call, you’d give to call the Irwins and get permission to talk to that person. This kind of control didn’t happen overnight, but was the byproduct of slow indoctrination.”

“We were told people would be going to hell if they were not part of the church,” Ames claims. “For years after I left, I was worried I was going to go to hell. I don’t know why we believed the Irwins were the only way to get to heaven, but they would tell us they could see into our homes and that they were incapable of doing wrong or sinning.”"

“The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program,' a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,” Trump wrote online in a pair of posts. “We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter).”

“'Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europe’s problems’ said Col. Tony Shaffer. We will stop this craziness!” Trump added in a third post, referencing Shaffer’s appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.”

Eight people were killed and 11 more injured on Tuesday when a driver in a truck drove down a New York City bike path, brandishing air guns and yelling “God is great” in Arabic. The driver, who is in police custody, has been identified as Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan who came to the U.S. legally in 2010.

New York’s ABC affiliate reported that Saipov came to the U.S. via the Diversity Visa Lottery, a program that offers visas to individuals from nations that otherwise have relatively few immigrants in the U.S. The program’s origins are based in a 1990 bill introduced by Schumer, who was then a member of the House, that was then absorbed into a larger immigration bill co-sponsored by 32 lawmakers, a group that included Schumer and six Republicans.

In a statement issued later Wednesday morning, Schumer accused the president of politicizing Tuesday's attack and urged him to push for more anti-terrorism funding from Congress.

“I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America. President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution — anti-terrorism funding — which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget,"" Schumer said. “I’m calling on the president to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding.”

Later Wednesday morning, Schumer took to Twitter to criticize the president in a series of posts by drawing a contrast between Trump’s handling of the attack and former President George W. Bush’s response in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

“President Trump, where is your leadership? The contrast btwn Pres Bush’s actions after 9-11 & Pres Trump’s this am couldn't be starker. President Bush, in a moment of national tragedy, understood the meaning of his high office & sought to bring our country together,” Schumer wrote. “After 9/11, 1st thing Pres Bush did was invite Sen @hillaryclinton & me to the White House & pledged to do all in his power to help our city.”

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio agreed, telling CNN's ""New Day"" that ""the last thing the president or anyone else should do is politicize this tragedy ... the last thing we should do is start casting aspersions on whole races of people or whole religions or whole nations. That only makes the situation worse.""

Trump has argued for an overhaul of the nation’s immigration system, advocating for a dramatic cut in the number of refugees admitted by the U.S., “extreme vetting” of those entering the U.S. and the implementation of a merit-based system for immigrants.

Schumer and the president have clashed frequently throughout Trump's first months in office, with the president pinning multiple nicknames on the Senate minority leader, including ""head clown"" and ""cryin' Chuck Schumer,"" in response to criticism from the New York senator. But the pair has also shown glimmers of being able to work together, most notably in September when it seemed Trump had struck a deal with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on an immigration deal.

Schumer was caught on a hot C-SPAN microphone at the time, remarking that ""he likes me,"" an apparent reference to his negotiations with Trump. The warm feelings appear to have been short-lived though and the immigration deal that had apparently been struck has stalled, if not fallen through completely.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday expressed condolences to the victims, noting that a Belgium citizen was killed in the attack.

“Once again, we've seen the evil face of terror in our own borders, but this is a face that knows no borders, and certainly Belgium, Europe and other countries have to deal with this evil that confronts us from time to time,” he said."

Jeff Flake’s senate seat, is in deep to the same sleazy data mining firm that accessed the private information of more than 50 million Facebook users and, according to a British news report, was caught on tape outlining how it could nail politicians by way of bribes and Ukranian sex workers.

And you thought Ward’s kookiest association had to do with chemtrails.

This same firm, Cambridge Analytica, was used by Donald Trump’s presidential campaign to “harvest” (as they say) the information from unwitting Facebook users and use it to influence voters. That's 50 million victims.

It turns out that the political candidate mostly likely to follow in the muddy footsteps of the Trump campaign is ... Kelli Ward.

According to Open Secrets, the political action committee supporting Ward's campaign, KelliPAC, paid Cambridge Analytica $450,000 in August.

And the connection doesn't end there.

This firm apparently was funded by big time Republican donor named Robert Mercer and the one-time White House insider and Trump pal Stephen Bannon.

According the British news report, an executive for Cambridge Analytica says one way they might get dirt on a politician is to “send some girls around to the candidate’s house.” He said Ukrainian girls “are very beautiful” and that he finds it “works very well.”

Not only did the billionaire Robert Mercer and his pal Steve Bannon fund Cambridge Analytica but Mercer also is responsible, in large part, for Kelli Ward.

According to a report on the KelliPAC website, Mercer donated $300,000 to the PAC this time around. Her website adds, “Mercer and his wife Diana donated $700,000 to this PAC in 2016 when Ward faced off against another Trump critic Sen. John McCain.”

Does that jibe with Ward's purported values?

According to her campaign website, Ward believes in “traditional principles and values.” She believes in “faith"" and ""love of God.""

Does this fit in with family values?

How does that conform with Ward's supporting PAC taking a million dollars from a man who backed a firm that accessed the private information of more than 50 million Facebook users and boasts of using bribes and Ukranian sex workers to get politicians?

Should a families values candidate be in any way associated with a firm that operates that way?

Shouldn't that bother a believer of ""traditional principles and values?""

Shouldn’t a person of faith, who lives in accordance with “traditional principles and values,” want to see that money returned?

A group that supports the elimination of most opt-outs launched a television ad campaign in opposition to the referendum question last week, and critics of the law will begin airing ads this week, as well.

“The message is very simple: We have to protect our kids, and schools need to be a safe place for our kids,” said Dr. Laura Blaisdell, a pediatrician and co-chair of Maine Families for Vaccines, which supports the law.

Every major medical organization in Maine supports the law, she said. Removal of nonmedical exemptions for vaccines protects community health, prevents infectious disease outbreaks and protects people with impaired immune systems, she said.

But groups that want to restore philosophical and religious exemptions contend that parents, not lawmakers, should be responsible for making medical decisions for children.

Mainers will get the final say on March 3 on a law that ends nonmedical vaccine opt-outs by September 2021 for students at public and private schools and universities, including nursery schools, and for health care facility employees. It’s part of a trend of states tightening rules on vaccine exemptions in response to growing numbers of unvaccinated children.

The campaign mirrors the emotional debate in the Maine Legislature.

Fighting the medical establishment with the so-called “People’s Veto” referendum is a multipartisan assortment of Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Independents and others, including parents who believe in vaccines but also support “medical choice.”

“This is the only issue that we all exclusively agree on,” said Cara Sacks, campaign manager of Yes on 1 Maine to Reject Big Pharma.

Much of the messaging from groups that support the right to opt out of vaccinations has focused on criticism of the pharmaceutical industry. Critics say linking the vaccines to big pharma is disingenuous because vaccines account for a small fraction of pharmaceutical revenues even though they account for billions of dollars in sales across the globe.

The pharmaceutical industry contributed to the major ad buy to encourage people to support the changes. The TV ads backfired by raising concerns about pharmaceutical meddling, Sacks said.

The Legislature’s action last year came against the backdrop of a spike in whooping cough cases in Maine.

Maine has one of the highest rates of nonmedical vaccine exemptions in the nation, and officials warned that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rate among kindergarteners had dropped below 94%. That means half of kindergarten classes are below the “herd” immunity level of 95% immunization, state officials said.

Rep. Ryan Tipping of Orono, who sponsored the bill, said no one wants to see a situation like the one on Samoa where a measles epidemic swept across the island last year because of low vaccination rates. The nearby U.S. territory of American Saomoa began mass immunizations in response.

“We know what kind of trouble that can happen with measles outbreaks. There are places that have been completely devastated by it. A lot of people don’t want to see that happen in Maine,” he said."

The vaccine in question, marketed as Gardasil and Cervarix, prevents infection of HPV, the human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted virus that is the primary cause of cervical cancer and a major cause of anal, vaginal and penile cancers. The HPV vaccine, approved by the FDA in 2006, is recommended for girls ages 9 and older, before they become sexually active.

In a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. physicians, some doctors reported they are opposed to the vaccine on moral grounds or have concerns about its cost, safety or efficacy. Although those in opposition represent a minority, many provided insightful written explanations as to why they are reluctant to recommend the vaccine to patients. [5 Dangerous Vaccination Myths]

A survey analysis, conducted by the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla., is detailed online in the Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology. The researchers, led by Susan Vadaparampil, say that because a doctor's recommendation is a driving force behind a parent allowing a child to receive this largely non-mandatory vaccine, understanding doctors' concerns is crucial to improving vaccination rates.

Most sexually active men and women will acquire at least one strain of HPV in their lives, and half of sexually active young adults under age 25 are infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Only certain strains of HPV cause cancer, however, and most cervical infections can be detected by a pap smear and treated before becoming cancerous. Nevertheless, each year more than 12,000 women develop cervical cancer. Worldwide there are about a half million cases annually and 250,000 related deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

The HPV vaccine isn't the first vaccine associated with a sexually transmitted disease. The hepatitis B virus is spread primarily through unprotected sex. The ""HepB"" vaccine is given to infants and lasts upwards of 25 years. HepB lacks controversy, though, because children can acquire the liver-damaging hepatitis B non-sexually through infected members in their household. [Quiz: Test Your STD Smarts]

The HPV vaccine, on the other hand, is chiefly about sex and has all the buzzwords to make it controversial: teenage girls, cervix, vagina and penis.

The doctors' survey indicated that some physicians — particularly family physicians, as opposed to gynecologists and pediatricians — echoed complaints voiced by some parents: that the vaccine given to preteens or young teenagers promotes promiscuity, lulls girls into a false sense of security, and discourages them from seeking regular gynecological screening.

There is no evidence to support these concerns, the researchers said. In fact, general vaccine usage dictates otherwise: No one knowingly steps on dirty nails, emboldened by the power of a tetanus shot. Also, studies reveal that teenagers are more aware of other common and immediate hazards of unprotected sex: HIV, gonorrhea and teen pregnancy. Thus teenagers would not have unprotected sex based solely on protection offered against something that prevents cancer decades down the line.

However, Vadaparampil said the concept that girls would neglect future screening deserves further investigation, because this would have serious consequences.

Most doctors concerned about the vaccine cost — more than $100 for each of the three required shots, although usually free for the uninsured — were not against the HPV vaccine, but rather wanted to reduce the financial burden imposed on parents. As for safety and efficacy, many doctors said that these concerns would likely diminish over time.

Fewer than 45 percent of girls in the target group between ages 13 and 18 have received one or more of the three shots, according to the CDC. That's less than half of the vaccination rates for most childhood vaccines. The average age of sexual debut for U.S. girls is 17.4.

The percentage of girls who complete the HPV vaccine series is dropping, according to a paper published last month in the journal Cancer. This surprised the researchers, from the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, who thought they'd uncovered a rise in vaccine rates.

In essence, the older the girl, the less likely she will seek her follow-up shots. Girls most likely to get three complete shots, spaced out over the course of a year, were ages 9 to 12. But even for this group, the rate is falling: In 2006, 57 percent of preteens who got the first shot got the next two; in 2009, only 21 percent did the same, the study showed.

The two studies combined suggest the need to have girls vaccinated as early as possible — young enough to maintain a three-shot schedule, and young enough to view the vaccine with innocence for what it is, a cancer preventative, not a magical condom.

The report said that 19.4 million children did not get fully vaccinated from preventable diseases, an increase of 700,000 on 2017. The UN agencies said there had been a ""dangerous stagnation of global vaccination rates, due to conflict, inequality and complacency.""

The report further warned that 2019 could present an even bigger crisis. Initial data suggested the number of measles cases had increased by 300 times since the first quarter of 2018.

WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said ""vaccines are one of our most important tools for preventing outbreaks and keeping the world safe.""

""It's often those who are most at risk – the poorest, the most marginalized, those touched by conflict or forced from their homes - who are persistently missed,"" he added. ""Far too many are left behind.""

A previously almost eradicated illness, measles, has been sharply on the rise, the report detailed. Cases of the measles disease more than doubled since 2017, to 350,000. Cases had before fallen by 80% between 2000 and 2017.

The report also said other preventable diseases, like tetanus and diphtheria, had not been vaccinated against sufficiently.

WHO have partially blamed the ""anti-vaxx” movement for the increase in diseases such as measles, senior figures at WHO have said. The movement alleged wrongly that vaccines were linked to an increase in conditions such as autism.

The director of WHO's vaccines department, Kate O'Brien, said in Geneva that the UN was ""concerned about the proliferation of misinformation (and) outright false information,"" online.

The German Federal Center for Health Education said in April they worried about the effect misinformation was having on adults and children and their decisions to take vaccines or to miss it. The government plans to make a measles vaccination compulsory.

The report did also detail some positives. Polio, it said, has almost been eradicated across the world, with only Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan seeing endemic levels of the disease.

Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Edward Snowden's book, ""Permanent Record.""

Is the U.S. government hiding the existence of aliens? According to whistleblower Edward Snowden, the answer is no.

The former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor wrote about his discoveries – or lack thereof – in his recent memoir “Permanent Record” and again confirmed it during an interview on the podcast “Joe Rogan Experience.”

He also said on the podcast that ""there probably are aliens"" but dismissed the conspiracy theories that say the U.S. government is working overtime to conceal them.

Snowden, who is living in exile in Moscow, said he combed through databases before leaving his job at the NSA and found no evidence that would substantiate the conspiracy theories.

“I went looking on the network, right,” he said on Wednesday's episode. “I couldn’t find anything. If it’s hidden, and it could be hidden, it’s hidden really damn well, especially for people on the inside.”

US government sues Snowden over new memoir: 'Intelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit.'

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in September against Snowden, saying his memoir violates nondisclosure agreements he signed with the CIA and NSA.

The internationally recognized whistleblower made headlines when The Washington Post and The Guardian published stories based on his leaks detailing the U.S. government's mass surveillance program, including access to the cellphone records of millions of Americans.

Snowden said that he does not regret his actions and that he wants to return to the United States."

That is the conclusion of a new set of studies into what's become known as geo-engineering.

This is the so far unproven science of intervening in the climate to bring down temperatures.

These projects work by, for example, shading the Earth from the Sun or soaking up carbon dioxide.

Ideas include aircraft spraying out sulphur particles at high altitude to mimic the cooling effect of volcanoes or using artificial ""trees"" to absorb CO2.

Long regarded as the most bizarre of all solutions for global warming, ideas for geo-engineering have come in for more scrutiny in recent years as international efforts to limit carbon emissions have failed.

Now three combined research projects, led by teams from the universities of Leeds, Bristol and Oxford, have explored the implications in more detail.

The central conclusion, according to Dr Matt Watson of Bristol University, is that the issues surrounding geo-engineering - how it might work, the effects it might have and the potential downsides - are ""really really complicated"".

""We don't like the idea but we're more convinced than ever that we have to research it,"" he said.

""Personally I find this stuff terrifying but we have to compare it to doing nothing, to business-as-usual leading us to a world with a 4C rise.""

The studies used computer models to simulate the possible implications of different technologies - with a major focus on ideas for making the deserts, seas and clouds more reflective so that incoming solar radiation does not reach the surface.

One simulation imagined sea-going vessels spraying dense plumes of particles into the air to try to alter the clouds. But the model found that this would be far less effective than once thought.

Another explored the option of injecting sulphate aerosols into the air above the Arctic in an effort to reverse the decline of sea-ice.

A key finding was that none of the simulations managed to keep the world's temperature at the level experienced between 1986-2005 - suggesting that any effort would have to be maintained for years.

More alarming for the researchers were the potential implications for rainfall patterns.

Although all the simulations showed that blocking the Sun's rays - or solar radiation management, as it is called - did reduce the global temperature, the models revealed profound changes to precipitation including disrupting the Indian Monsoon.

Prof Piers Forster of Leeds University said: ""We have found that between 1.2 and 4.1 billion people could be adversely affected by changes in rainfall patterns.

""The most striking example of a downside would be the complete drying-out of the Sahel region of Africa - that would be very difficult to adapt to for those substantial populations - and that happens across all the scenarios.""

Despite the risk of catastrophic side-effects from geo-engineering, the study authors believe that research should continue just in case runaway warming leaves no other options.

Prof Forster said: ""If we were in a really desperate situation, trying to cool the temps for a 10-20 year time period, there could be some merit in those circumstances in introducing solar radiation management to give you a 10-20 year time period.""

According to Prof Steve Rayner of Oxford University, it is easier to devise the technology than to understand its effects or how its use should be governed.

""If you were just thinking of the capability of putting sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, that you could do in less than two decades - whether you would know it was smart to do it in less than two decades is another question.

""We don't know enough - we have a few islands of knowledge in a sea of ignorance and it's absolutely worth knowing more. There is the potential that some of these technologies may be part of a broader tool kit of ways in which we can better manage climate change.

""People decry solar radiation management as a band-aid but band-aids can be useful for healing.""

Geo-engineering has long been one of the most controversial aspects of the debate about solutions to climate change and few experiments have been conducted in the field.

One of the largest, known as Lohafex, was an Indian-German experiment in 2009 which involved dumping six tonnes of an iron solution into the South Atlantic to encourage plankton to bloom - trapping carbon which would then be sent to the seabed when the organisms died. Results showed limited success.

Another proposal for the trial flight of a balloon in Britain, as part of geo-engineering research for the SPICE project, attracted stiff opposition from environmental groups and was cancelled.

It would have been the precursor to a test of a technique for pumping sulphate aerosols into the atmosphere in an effort to bounce solar radiation back into space and cool the planet."

Both sides are mistaken. Washington's policy traces an even longer, more shrouded and fateful history. Forty years ago, the Central Intelligence Agency, under President John F. Kennedy, conducted its own regime change in Baghdad, carried out in collaboration with Saddam Hussein.

The Iraqi leader seen as a grave threat in 1963 was Abdel Karim Kassem, a general who five years earlier had deposed the Western-allied Iraqi monarchy. Washington's role in the coup went unreported at the time and has been little noted since. America's anti-Kassem intrigue has been widely substantiated, however, in disclosures by the Senate Committee on Intelligence and in the work of journalists and historians like David Wise, an authority on the C.I.A.

From 1958 to 1960, despite Kassem's harsh repression, the Eisenhower administration abided him as a counter to Washington's Arab nemesis of the era, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt -- much as Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush would aid Saddam Hussein in the 1980's against the common foe of Iran. By 1961, the Kassem regime had grown more assertive. Seeking new arms rivaling Israel's arsenal, threatening Western oil interests, resuming his country's old quarrel with Kuwait, talking openly of challenging the dominance of America in the Middle East -- all steps Saddam Hussein was to repeat in some form -- Kassem was regarded by Washington as a dangerous leader who must be removed."

On the tape, the speaker described the U.S. occupation of Iraq as the beginning of an occupation of Persian Gulf states for their oil and makes other references to events in the last few months.

A CIA official said a technical analysis of the audiotape compared it to samples known to be of bin Laden's voice and showed that ""it is likely him.""

Reacting to the CIA's analysis, a senior Bush administration official said, ""It is another reminder. There has been a lot of progress, but the war on terror continues.""

The voice on the tape called on Muslims to overthrow regimes in the Middle East that are working with the United States or participating in peace efforts with Israel.

The speaker referred to other recent events such as the December 1 launching of an unofficial peace plan by Israelis and Palestinians in Geneva, Switzerland, and the November 8 suicide bombing of a residential compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The bombing killed 17 people, most of them Arabs. A Saudi official said the blast had the earmarks of bin Laden's terrorist network.

""My message to you today is in reference to stressing the importance of the continuation of Jihad to fend off the conspiracies that have been and are still being plotted against our nation,"" the speaker on the tape said.

""Especially that now some of those conspiracies have become clear by way of the occupation of Baghdad by the crusaders and those heretics that are supporting them under the pretext of WMD [weapons of mass destruction].""

Unlike previous tapes attributed to the al Qaeda leader, the latest one began with the speaker stating that he is bin Laden.

He called on Muslims to form a council to run the Middle East and lead a jihad against governments in the region.

The voice said that ""it is imperative that those governments have to be brought down,"" because in working with the ""infidels"" they ""shed the blood of their brothers and sisters.""

Persian Gulf leaders, the speaker said, are not capable of defending the Islamic nation. ""There is no dialogue except with weapons,"" he said.

The speaker said the U.S.-led war in Iraq was part of a ""religious and economic war"" to control the Arab world. ""Today, Baghdad; tomorrow, Riyadh,"" he said.

In the first two of three segments on the audiotape, the speaker accused Americans of seeking to change the ""beliefs, values and curricula of the Muslims so that they become more tolerant as they claim.""

""Clearly put this is an economical and religious war. The occupation of Iraq is but an episode in the series of the Zionist and crusaders' campaign,"" he said. ""Then will come the total occupation of the rest of the countries of the Gulf in preparation to spread hegemony and control over the whole world.

""The Gulf and its countries is but the key to control the world in the view of the super powers due to the huge oil reserves.""

Citing the Geneva initiative and the ""road map"" for Middle East peace backed by the United Nations, European Union, Russia and United States, the tape called on Muslims to fight all efforts at achieving peace with Israel.

""If you don't take them on in Jerusalem, they'll take your two holy sites,"" the speaker said, referring to Mecca and Medina.

The previous tape likely containing bin Laden's voice aired October 18, U.S. officials said. The officials said references on that tape indicated it had been recorded at some point during the previous three months.

A senior U.S. official said the recent decision to put the nation on heightened terror alert was based on intelligence showing a risk ""for the holidays and beyond.""

""We are now into 'beyond,' "" the official said.

Administration officials decline to say how much longer they intend to keep the nation at alert level orange, the second highest point on the color-coded system. Some sources said information suggests a heightened level of risk for some weeks to come.

For the voiceless and downtrodden, as well as anyone with a penchant for waving handwritten protest signs, Anonymous is a light in the darkness of what some may see as an oppressive New World Order controlled by the rich, powerful and immoral.

To them, the group is an ominous threat, a sleeping digital dragon that, when awakened, can wreak immense damage.

Defining Anonymous as a group may be a bit misleading, because there's no membership application, no initiation rituals and no certification or diploma that confirms someone as Anonymous. But there are some very real behaviors and customs within Anonymous.

Anonymous has spawned a whole set of mores and social norms and quirks of language, much of it documented in the Encyclopedia Dramatica.

Or, at least, during the mid-20th century communist-hunting era, the bureau thought she was a bit of a communist. But, says the Atlantic Wire, the feds could never quite pin her down.

According to the Associated Press, who got access to the documents through a Freedom of Information Act request, the files “show the extent the agency was monitoring Monroe for ties to communism in the years before her death in August 1962.”

The records had been available previously, but they were heavily redacted. The new re-issue saw some of those black marks taken away.

Monroe’s file begins in 1955 and mostly focuses on her travels and associations, searching for signs of leftist views and possible ties to communism. One entry, which previously had been almost completely redacted, concerned intelligence that Monroe and other entertainers sought visas to visit Russia that year. The file continues up until the months before her death, and also includes several news stories and references to Norman Mailer’s biography of the actress, which focused on questions about whether Monroe was killed by the government.

All 104 pages of Monroe’s two-part file are available online on the FBI’s The Vault, a site that houses all the documents released by the agency because of Freedom of Information Act requests.

The doctor, Van Koinis, may have left children unvaccinated, the Cook County Sheriff's Office said.

Van Koinis expressed regret for his actions but his note was ambiguous.

Officials are investigating if the much-loved paediatrician forged records so that anti-vaccination parents could obtain documents required for schools.

Dr Koinis reportedly wrote that he had become averse to immunisation in his last decade of work.

""He was incredibly regretful for what he did and it was the only thing he mentioned in the suicide note. It was this and only this,"" Chicago Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told US media, adding that the note was ""cryptic"".

""The biggest issue is parents who are under the impression their children are immunised when they are not,"" Sheriff Dart told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Former patients of Dr Koinis are now being advised to talk to a physician about their vaccination records.

Blood tests can determine if patients have received some immunisations, but not all, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Dr Koinis, who died in September last year, was highly regarded in his community in Chicago, with more than 1,000 reviews and a five-star rating on a physician ranking forum.

Several parents have defended him following the latest revelations, saying they had never heard him express anti-vaccine beliefs, and others say they witnessed him administer shots.

""My children and I love him so much. He is like part of our family,"" one woman, who said she had been bringing her children to Dr Koinis for 23 years, wrote on Facebook, the Washington Post reported.

Although McCarthy’s accusations created a momentary controversy, they were quickly dismissed as mere sensationalism from a man whose career was rapidly slipping away.

Senator McCarthy first made a name for himself in 1950 when he charged that over 200 “known communists” were in the Department of State. During the next few years, he alleged that communists were in nearly every branch of the U.S. government. His reckless accusations helped to create what came to be known as the Red Scare, a time when Americans feared that communists were infiltrating all aspects of American government and life. Despite the fact that McCarthy never managed to unearth a single communist, his ability to whip up public hysteria and smear opponents as communist sympathizers made him front-page news for several years. By 1954, however, his power was slipping. His earlier charges had been leveled at the Democratic administration of President Harry S. Truman, and Republicans had embraced McCarthy as a useful weapon. When Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower stepped into the presidency in 1953, however, McCarthy’s wild accusations became a nuisance and source of embarrassment to the Republican Party.

Sensing that his base of power was eroding, in 1954 McCarthy embarked on a spectacularly unsuccessful effort to recapture public support by opening investigations into alleged communist infiltration of the U.S. Army. By early June 1954, the McCarthy-Army hearings had been going on for nearly a month. This was the first opportunity for the American public to get a firsthand view of McCarthy, as the hearings were televised. His bullying style and hysterical behavior quickly turned off the audience. In a desperate attempt to regain momentum, McCarthy charged that communists had also infiltrated the CIA and atomic weapons industry. No one took the charges seriously, and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, his brother, CIA Director Allen Dulles, and President Eisenhower brusquely dismissed McCarthy’s accusations as reckless and without basis.

Just a few weeks later, McCarthy was thoroughly disgraced when the lawyer for the U.S. Army, Joseph Welch, gave him a devastatingly effective tongue-lashing, which ended with Welch asking the senator whether he had any sense of “decency” at all. The McCarthy-Army hearings collapsed soon thereafter, and the U.S. Senate voted to censure McCarthy. He died, still holding office, in 1957."

Undergoing vaccination against the pathogen may be an effective way to prevent the condition. Could a routine childhood vaccination reduce the incidence of type 1 diabetes? The exact reason a person develops this condition is unknown, but experts believe that a complex relationship between many genetic and environmental factors is at play. A longstanding theory has implicated certain infections in early childhood as a trigger for type 1 diabetes — particularly in children who are genetically susceptible. One such infection is rotavirus. Infection with rotavirus causes gastroenteritis, also known as stomach flu. In infants, rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis. Writing in the journal PLOS Pathogens, Dr. Leonard C. Harrison — a professor at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research at the University of Melbourne in Australia — and colleagues present data that underpin their theory of a link between rotavirus and type 1 diabetes. They point to two studies in particular that show a drop in new type 1 diabetes cases in children who received the rotavirus vaccine.

Experts are warning that the number of people living with type 1 diabetes is on the rise. In 2009, a group of European scientists published the results of a multicenter study that looked at almost 30,000 newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes in children under the age of 15. Based on these data, they predicted a “doubling of new cases of type 1 diabetes in European children younger than 5 years […] between 2005 and 2020.” In Australia, Dr. Harrison writes, environmental factors very likely played a vital role in this increase. “An interesting observation in the Australian context that may be relevant to [rotavirus] as a candidate environmental factor relates to the practice of mothers “rooming-in” with their newborns,” he notes. “This was introduced in the 1970s and entailed mother and baby remaining together rather than separating the baby to a communal nursery at night.” Infections with rotavirus were common in newborn nurseries. Having babies stay with their mothers delayed their exposure to the virus. Dr. Harrison cites research in mice suggesting that the timing of rotavirus exposure may be crucial. When genetically susceptible newborn mice became infected with the virus, they did not go on to develop type 1 diabetes. However, animals exposed to rotavirus at a later time did.

If infection with rotavirus during early infancy does trigger type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible people, what happened when health professionals introduced the rotavirus vaccine as part of the recommended immunization schedule? “We hypothesized that if natural infection with [rotavirus] was a causative factor in [type 1 diabetes], then [rotavirus] vaccination would alter the incidence of [condition],” Dr. Harrison explains. Looking at the 8 years before the introduction of the vaccine into the Australian National Immunization Program in 2007 and the subsequent 8 years, the team saw a drop in the number of new type 1 diabetes cases. According to their earlier JAMA Pediatrics paper, the data showed a 15% reduction in new type 1 diabetes diagnoses in children ages 0–4. However, there was no difference in rates among children ages 5–14. Another study paper in the journal Scientific Reports reported similar results. Having analyzed data from nearly 1.5 million children in the United States between 2001 and 2017, the study authors reported a 41% reduction in new cases of type 1 diabetes during this time in children who received all doses of the rotavirus vaccine. This was not the case for those who only received some of the shots or who never underwent vaccination. However, Dr. Harrison points out that not all studies have come to the same conclusion. For example, a population study of 495 Finnish children did not find a significant change in the risk of type 1 diabetes when the scientists compared vaccinated and unvaccinated children. “Environmental factors promoting the increase in [type 1 diabetes] incidence on particular genetic backgrounds are likely to be ubiquitous and multiple,” conclude Dr. Harrison and colleagues. “That [rotavirus] may be one such factor is supported by several lines of evidence […], to which we can now add an association between [rotavirus] vaccination and a decrease in [type 1 diabetes] incidence.” “This may be the first clear example of primary prevention of [type 1 diabetes].”"

Exposure to global debt securities is attractive to investors wanting to diversify fixed income positions held in the domestic market with bonds issued by foreign entities.

Within international bond mutual funds, managers select certain global debt positions with varying maturity dates, country exposure, and overall default risk exposure to reduce the potential for loss within a portfolio while attempting to earn a modest return. Investors who want to participate in the international bond market through mutual funds should understand the risks by reviewing the current prospectus for the below funds, which have been the favorites among investors in 2020.

The PIMCO International Bond Fund seeks to provide investors with maximum total return through the preservation of capital and prudent investment management of a portfolio of fixed income securities. The fund's managers invest at least 80% of fund assets in fixed income holdings that have economic ties to foreign countries. The majority of investments made within the mutual fund include investment grade securities, although fund managers have the flexibility to invest up to 10% of investor assets in junk bonds with B ratings or higher. With an inception date of 1997, the fund has net assets of $12.4 billion as of Feb. 29, 2020 and a 10-year annualized return of 5.14%.

The Pimco Emerging Markets Local Currency and Bond Fund seeks high-yield and currency appreciation by actively managing a portfolio of local currency denominated debt in emerging market locations. The primary investment assets are the government bonds of emerging market countries. Pimco believes this fund adds portfolio diversification as emerging market debt has had a low correlation with standard fixed-income assets, such as U.S. Treasuries.

The fund began trading in 2006, has net assets of $1.8 billion as of Feb. 29, 2020, and a 10-year average annual return of 2.53%. The top 10 currency exposures in the fund are Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Russia, Thailand, U.S., Poland, South Africa, Malaysia, and Colombia. The effective maturity of holdings is 8.96 years. The fund has an adjusted expense ratio of 0.90%.

The Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Debt Fund seeks high levels of total return by investing its assets into the debt of emerging market countries, with the bulk of concentrations in Latin America (30.4%), Middle East/Africa (26.3%), Central and Eastern Europe (18.1%), and Asia (16.4%). The top countries include Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, Ukraine, and Egypt. 75% of the debt holdings range from B to BBB rated.

The fund started in 2003 and as of Feb. 29, 2020, the fund has net assets of $1.6 billion, a 10-year average annual return of 6.47%. The fund has a net expense ratio of 0.85%.

The T. Rowe Institutional Emerging Markets Bond Fund is a riskier fund whose investments may include the lowest-rated bonds, some of which may be in default. There is more volatility in these bonds due to the instability of the political landscape in the emerging market countries

The fund's managers invest in a variety of securities, including futures, swaps, and other derivatives. The fund's net assets as of Feb. 29, 2020, was $492 million, with a 10-year average annual return of 6.44%. The fund primarily invests in corporate and sovereign debt. Country exposure includes Mexico, Ukraine, Turkey, Egypt, Serbia, Argentina, and Peru. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%.

The GMO Emerging Country Debt Fund has an objective of achieving total return in excess of its benchmark, which is the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global Diversified. The main investments are that of sovereign debt. The goal is to focus on bottom-up issue selection, to find debt that has similar characteristics to the J.P. index but with better long-term total return prospects.

The fund began trading in 1995 and as of Jan. 31, 2020, has a net asset value of $4.4 billion with a 10-year return of 9.30%.

The devices were discovered between Jan. 24, 2018, and Feb. 24, 2018, according to the FBI's timeline, which adds details about the timing and type of device used.

The FBI released the statement Monday morning, recounting the case and adding details of the bureau's role and the evidence against the man, some of which have not been previously reported.

The convicted bomber is described by the FBI as a ""terrorist sympathizer"" who was radicalized by reading propaganda from Anwar al-Awlaki, Osama bin Laden and others.

Wesley ""Dallas"" Ayers, 28, was sentenced in March to more than 30 years in federal prison and another 5 years of supervision after release. He pleaded guilty to using, attempting to use, and threatening to use weapons of mass destruction; possession and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime; and to the use of an explosive device during the commission of a felony.

Ayers is being held at a federal detention center in Illinois with an anticipated release date in 2044, according to online records.

The Independent Mail and The Greenville News has previously reported many of the details of the case, including that one device was a teddy bear pipe bomb and that the investigation began after an Anderson County man was injured by a small explosive device found in a basket in a roadway.

Arabic writing from that basket device referenced Osama bin Laden led investigators to call in federal officials, who sent investigators to Anderson County. A tip came in about a similar bomb previously noticed but not reported to authorities and another bomb-like object was found, according to the FBI.

On Feb. 15, 2018, a basket with a teddy bear was placed on an Anderson County road, according to the FBI statement. The teddy bear had nails and a pipe bomb inside

Bomb technicians disabled that bomb, found a hoax three days later and then disabled a final bomb on February 24, according to the FBI's timeline.

The major break in the case came from a man who told police he knew someone was making bombs and investigators were able to link Ayers to the bombings, according to the FBI.

A warrant and a search of the home Ayers shared with his girlfriend resulted in evidence that included bomb components and wiring identical to that found in the deployed devices, as well as two guns and ""a type of vest known to be used by suicide bombers,"" according to the FBI.

“We knew based on all the evidence that he was not done deploying these devices,” said Special Agent Christopher Derrickson, a supervisor in the FBI Columbia office. “If he had not been caught, there would have been more.”"

The concept of artificially reflecting sunlight has been around for decades, yet this will be the first real attempt at controlling Earth's temperature through solar engineering.

The project, called Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), will spend $3 million to test their models by launching a steerable balloon in the southwest US 20 kilometers into the stratosphere. Once the balloon is in place, it will release small particles of calcium carbonate. Plans are in place to begin the launch as early as the spring of 2019.

The basis around this experiment is from studying the effects of large volcanic eruptions on the planet's temperature. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted spectacularly, releasing 20 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. The sulfur dioxide created a blanket around Earth's stratosphere, cooling the entire planet by 0.5 °C for around a year and a half.

As scientists, governmental agencies around the world, and environmental groups grow increasingly worried of our collective ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change, the idea of geoengineering a solution has become more accepted. The ultimate goal is to reduce the warming on Earth. This can be done by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sucking CO2 from the atmosphere, or limiting the sunlight that reaches Earth's surface.

The first two methods are actively discussed and implemented to various degrees. The recent commitment of G20 members (with the United States as the sole rejector) to the Paris Agreement will act to solve the source of the problem by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sucking CO2 from the atmosphere and locking it away in Earth's crust, called CO2 sequestration, has been implemented and deployed. For instance, Royal Dutch Shell has built large carbon sequestration facilities with the Canadian and Australian governments.

The third method, blocking out sunlight has been controversial in the scientific community for decades. The controversy lies in the inability to fully understand the consequences of partially blocking out sunlight. A reduction in global temperature is well understood and expected, however, there remain questions around this method's impact on precipitation patterns, the ozone, and crop yields globally.

This is precisely why the Harvard research team intends to spray tiny chalk (calcium carbonate) particles into the stratosphere in a controlled experiment. Computer models can only go so far in predicting the impacts this geoengineering technique, it is time for a real world test. With funding in part by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the Harvard team will begin to answer the remaining questions as early as the spring of 2019.

While the potential negative effects are not fully characterized, the ability to control Earth's temperature by spraying small particles into the stratosphere is an attractive solution largely due to its cost. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report estimated that the continual release of particles into the stratosphere could offset 1.5 °C of warming for $1 billion to $10 billion per year.

When comparing these costs with the global reduction in fossil fuel use or carbon sequestration, the method becomes very attractive. Thus, scientists, government agencies and independent funders of this technology must balance the inexpensive and effectiveness of this method with the potential risks to global crops, weather conditions, and drought. Ultimately, the only way to fully characterize the risks is to conduct real-world experiments, just as the Harvard team is embarking upon."

FBI Assistant Director Jay Cochran, who helmed the bureau's laboratory division at the time, responded that he was unable to find any records of such an examination. Byrne, touting his group's affiliation with the Academy of Applied Science in Boston, requested an examination of what he saw as an exciting new sample.

""Briefly, we do not often come across hair which we are unable to identify and the hair that we have now, about 15 hairs attached to a tiny piece of skin, is the first that we have obtained in six years which we feel may be of importance,"" Byrne wrote.

Cochran responded that while the FBI laboratory focused on criminal investigations, ""occasionally, on a case-by-case basis, in the interest of research and scientific inquiry, we make exceptions to this general policy.""

""With this understanding, we will examine the hairs and tissue mentioned in your letter,"" he added. The sample was analyzed with processes including ""transmitted and incident light microscopy,"" ""a study of morphological characteristics such as root structure, medullary structure and cuticle thickness,"" scale casts and direct comparison ""with hairs of known origin under a comparison microscope."" But the results were not as Byrne had hoped. ""It was concluded as a result of these examinations that the hairs are of deer family origin,"" Cochran wrote to Academy of Applied Science Executive Vice President Howard Curtis early the following year. The results and sample were returned to Curtis for safekeeping until Byrne was anticipated ""back from Nepal within a week or two."""

The World Health Organization estimates that 117 million people worldwide will miss out on vaccinations for preventable diseases due to COVID-19. Closer to home, the Canadian Paediatric Society is worried that Canadians will fall behind on their vaccination schedules. Vaccines are one of the most important public health tools at our disposal. Ignoring vaccinations can have dire consequences.

I am a historian of medicine. I study the history of infectious diseases and vaccination. In recent months, I have focused my research on the understudied effects of the 1918 flu pandemic on public health in Canada.

The experience of the 1918 influenza should act as a warning for provincial public health programs. My research shows that in the years after the 1918 flu, Canada suffered a series of outbreaks of smallpox and typhoid after vaccination took a backseat to the pandemic.

Provincial governments need to have a plan to get children back on track when COVID-19 subsides, or run the risk of creating an environment ripe for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.

Before the 1918 flu, local public health programs were temporary, and workers were volunteers. In 1923, the Health Board of Québec provided financial support to create permanent public health units. As part of this, it instituted a hygiene week, when the government educated communities about the importance of public health measures, including vaccination. Ontario followed suit, in 1924, when the chief officer of health helped develop full-time public health units for the province.

Though it may seem that the 1918 flu directly spurred the development of permanent public health units and sophisticated routine vaccine programs, the truth is more complicated. My study of public health reports shows that after the 1918 flu, cases of smallpox and other preventable diseases spiked.

In 1920, Canada had 2,553 cases of smallpox, compared to a baseline of a couple hundred a year. Cases continued climbing to a peak of 3,300 in 1927, before declining to near zero in the 1940s. In 1923, Cochrane, Ont. had an outbreak of typhoid with 800 cases and 50 deaths. With a population of 3,400, cases represented almost a quarter of the population.

Outbreaks in the wake of 1918 flu

It is difficult to track vaccination uptake in the early 1900s, because records of vaccination during this period were spotty at best. Nonetheless, these lapses in public health expose failures to maintain adequate vaccination levels in communities across Canada in the wake of the 1918 flu, which interrupted many aspects of life including commerce, religion and vaccination.

After the 1918 flu, however, public health officers did not take measures necessary to make up for lost time and missed vaccinations. It was not until several outbreaks had occurred, such as the one in Cochrane, that public health authorities regained control over preventable diseases.

Getting infectious diseases under control meant ensuring shots were administered as part of routine vaccination programs. This was a messy process and it did not happen all at once. However, by 1940 Toronto acheived the distinction of being the first city with a population over 500,000 to report no cases of smallpox. Toronto achieved this by tracking vaccinations closely and by advertising smallpox vaccination at the same time every year.

Today, Canadian vaccination programs are threatened by vaccine misinformation, rejection and apathy. At the same time, a growing number of Canadians are hesitant to vaccinate. These factors leave Canada with slim margins on maintaining herd immunity, which refers to the point at which the percentage of people immunized ensures protection of the whole community from disease. Even before COVID-19, Canada has had outbreaks of measles in under-vaccinated communities. In 2019, Canada reported 113 cases of measles.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created many problems that will need attention. Already provinces are creating step-by-step plans to reopen their economies. What is needed now is for provinces to create step-by-step plans for identifying and contacting those who have fallen behind on their vaccinations."
124,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions various actors, such as Ann Coulter, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Susan Sontag, Michael Moore, and Oliver Stone.",True,The article discusses the actions and statements of the mentioned actors.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"On any important issue, you can expect to hear a vigorous argument between liberals and conservatives. But when it comes to dealing with the Sept. 11 attacks, the most noteworthy debate is the one going on among people on the left and other people on the left.

In that discussion, some commentators have shown a firm grasp of reality and unapologetic patriotism. Others, however, have been striving mightily to make themselves into national laughingstocks.

There are plenty of conservatives, of course, who have used the opportunity to permanently disqualify themselves from ever being taken seriously again--including Ann Coulter, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. But for sheer volume of imbecility, it's hard to outdo the blame-America-first crowd of mindless peaceniks and twitchy conspiracy theorists. The New Republic, a moderately liberal political weekly, has been running a regular feature called ""Idiocy Watch,"" highlighting particularly lamebrained comments, and the forum has so far been dominated by lefties.

In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorism, writer Susan Sontag found herself barraged with criticism for decrying the ""self-righteous drivel and outright deception being peddled by public figures and TV commentators,"" while assailing our ""cowardly"" approach to war.

Weeks later, her bout of temporary insanity is beginning to look permanent. ""I don't like throwing biscuits and peanut butter and jam and napkins, little snack packages produced in a small city in Texas, so we can say, `Look, we're doing something humanitarian,' "" sneers Sontag in an interview with the online magazine Salon. She fears that the government is about to deport all Muslims and declare martial law, which is about as likely as Susan Sontag being appointed secretary of defense.

Humorist Michael Moore, who made the anti-capitalist movie ""Roger & Me,"" finds reasons to yuk it up. ""Finally, the bombs are raining down on Afghanistan, and as Martha Stewart says, that's a good thing,"" he brays on his Web site. ""Yesiree, I say, BOMBS AWAY! Rockets red glare. We are all WHITE WITH FOAM!"" I don't know about you, but I laughed till my ribs hurt.

Professional moviemaker and amateur paranoid Oliver Stone saw the terrorist attacks as the fault of the Republican Party. ""Does anybody make a connection between the 2000 election and the events of Sept. 11?"" he asked at a recent panel discussion in New York, which I take to mean that the terrorists were bitter that Al Gore didn't win.

Stone searched hard and found something good to say about Osama bin Laden and Co.: ""The new world order is about order and control. This attack was pure chaos, and chaos is energy. All great changes have come from people or events that were initially misunderstood, and seemed frightening, like madmen.""

Does it seem odd to you that Oliver Stone would feel affinity with madmen? Me neither.

Fortunately, you can find plenty of left-of-center commentators who prefer their country and its ideals over those of the enemy. At the New York forum, writer Christopher Hitchens lambasted Stone as a ""moral idiot, as well as an intellectual idiot."" The attack, he said, was ""state-supported mass murder, using civilians as missiles.""

The Nation magazine, perhaps the best-known organ of leftist thought, published a column by Katha Pollitt on why she refused to let her daughter decorate their living-room window with an American flag--which Mom regards as a symbol of ""jingoism and vengeance and war."" (The daughter retorts that the flag ""means standing together and honoring the dead and saying no to terrorism."" Where does she get such ideas?)

But many other Nation contributors have taken a sharply different view from Pollitt's. Writing in the latest issue, Princeton professor Richard Falk agrees with those who fault the U.S. as an imperialist power, but says that critique is ""dangerously inappropriate in addressing the challenge posed by the massive crime against humanity committed on Sept. 11."" The American role in world affairs, he argues, ""cannot be addressed so long as this movement of global terrorism is at large and prepared to carry on with its demonic work.""

Nation columnist Eric Alterman has no charity toward those who feel no patriotism at a time like this. Some of them, he says, ""really do hate their country. These leftists find nothing to admire in its magnificent Constitution; its fitful history of struggle toward greater freedom for women, minorities and other historically oppressed groups; and its values, however imperfectly or hypocritically manifested in everyday life."" For Alterman, ""patriotism requires no apologies.""

Those who feel differently--who can't take their own country's side when it is under attack by murderous foreign theocrats--should find themselves disgraced and ignored long after this struggle is over. In wartime, as leftists like Alterman understand, stupidity is not forgivable."

The United States reported more than 55,000 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the largest daily increase any country has ever reported, according to a Reuters tally.

Coronavirus cases are rising in 37 out of 50 U.S. states including Florida, which confirmed more than 10,000 new cases on Thursday. That marked the state’s largest daily spike so far and a level that exceeded single-day tallies from any European country at the height of the outbreak there.

In a major policy reversal, Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Thursday decreed that face masks must be worn in all counties with over 20 coronavirus cases, billing the measure as a requirement to avoid another economic shutdown.

For over two months, Abbott ignored calls by the Democratic leaders of Texas’ metropolitan areas to mandate mask wearing. Wearing face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus is unpopular among Abbott’s conservative Republican base in Texas, but he said in a video released on Thursday that the action was now absolutely necessary.

“We must do more to slow the spread without locking Texas back down,” Abbott said. “We are now at a point where the virus is spreading so fast, there is little margin for error.”

Britain will end coronavirus quarantines for people arriving in England from more than 50 countries, including Germany, France, Spain and Italy - but not the United States.

The move, effective July 10, clears the way for millions of British tourists to take summer holidays without worrying about being quarantined when they return. Those arriving from higher risk countries will still have to self-quarantine for 14 days under a rule which has angered airlines and travel companies.

The full list of countries has not yet been published. New Zealand is included, as are the Vatican and Britain’s overseas territories such as the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar. The United States remains on the “red list”. [

Japan will not reintroduce a state of emergency to tackle the novel coronavirus, a government spokesman said, as cases in Tokyo rose to a two-month high driven by the spread of the virus in the capital’s night spots.

Tokyo reported 124 new cases on Friday, up from 107 the day before, partly due to increased testing among nightlife workers in the Shinjuku and Ikebukuro districts.

Japan’s infection rates remain far below many other countries but the rising number of cases and the possibility of renewed restrictions have put the authorities and businesses on edge.

‘King of the road’ rules again

Thousands of jeepneys, flamboyantly decorated jeeps that serve as cheap public transport across the Philippines, were back on the streets of Manila on Friday, bringing relief to companies and commuters who have struggled with coronavirus curbs.

An estimated 55,000 of these large, multi-coloured trucks, dubbed “the kings of the road”, crawled through Manila’s gridlocked roads on a typical day before being forced to a halt 15 weeks ago when the government imposed a coronavirus lockdown.

Just 6,000 were back in business on Friday, operating at half capacity under strict social distancing rules. In pre-pandemic times, jeepneys routinely carried up to 15 passengers who sat knee-to-knee on twin benches in the windowless vehicles, choked by exhaust fumes."

Under that law, $3 billion has been paid to the vaccine injured while liability-free drug companies enjoy profits from a multibillion dollar market.

U.S. health officials now recommend 69 doses of 16 vaccines for every child. States mandate up to 15 of them — twice as many as 30 years ago.

With 95% of U.S. kindergarteners fully vaccinated and one child in six learning disabled, one in 10 asthmatic and one in 50 living with autism, educated parents and health care professionals are asking legitimate questions about why so many highly vaccinated children are so sick. They're examining vaccine science shortfalls and wondering why Americans are coerced and punished for declining to use every government-recommended vaccine while citizens in Canada, Japan and the European Union are free to make choices.

Vaccines carry two risks: a risk of harm and a risk of failure to prevent disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admit that U.S. pertussis outbreaks are not due to a failure to vaccinate but failure of the vaccine to confer long-lasting immunity.

The Institute of Medicine acknowledges major gaps in scientific knowledge about how and why vaccines cause injury and death and who will be more susceptible to suffering harm. Vaccine risks are not shared equally by all because ""no exceptions"" vaccine mandates discriminate against and penalize those vulnerable to vaccine complications.

Public health officials and pediatricians are not infallible. What is considered scientific ""truth"" today may not be true tomorrow. When doctors cannot predict who will be harmed by a vaccine and cannot guarantee that those who have been vaccinated won't get infected or transmit infection, the ethical principle of informed consent becomes a civil, human and parental right that must be safeguarded in U.S. law.

Non-medical vaccine exemptions immunize individuals and the community against unsafe, ineffective vaccines and tyranny.

Despite the meltdown, globalization has been good, he said. ""Globalization lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and created the potential for hundreds of millions more to share their destiny.""

But it's not clear how international commerce and finance will be reorganized coming out of the recession, Carney told the International Economic Forum of the Americas in Montreal.

Carney proposed an agenda for fixing the failures that caused the recession, saying ""the next wave of globalization needs to be more firmly grounded and its participants more responsible,"" in part because a belief in markets has been weakened by policy-makers and private players who didn't always live up to their responsibilities.

Carney suggested the ""new world order"" needs:
• More transparency to avoid problems such as inadequate disclosure on securitized products.
• More efficient markets that are less susceptible to extreme price movements, which contributed to companies failing and the global economy crashing.
• More prudent regulations, such as new capital requirements for banks, to help smooth the credit cycle.
• Ensuring all countries accept responsibility for promoting a better international monetary system, which could include allowing their exchange rates to adjust.

The decisions made in the recovery could influence how open, equitable, and prosperous the new world order will be, he said.

'More to come'

Carney said there are still major adjustments being made to inventories, investment growth will be negative into 2010, G7 unemployment will rise and excessive levels of private debt must still be cut.

""Although global demand and trade levels appear to be approaching bottom, and inventory and labour adjustments have already been substantial, there is still more to come,"" he said.

Governments have fought the economic shortfall with more spending, but they need to develop realistic exit strategies to avoid stifling the recovery, Carney said."

Carne Ross, who was a first secretary at the United Nations in New York for the Foreign Office until 2004, told MPs: ""A lot of facts about the run-up to this war have yet to come to light which should come to light and which the public deserves to know."" There were also assessments by the joint intelligence committee which had not been disclosed, Ross told the Commons public administration select committee.

He told the inquiry that the intelligence made it ""very clear"" that Saddam Hussein did not pose a significant threat to the UK, as was being claimed at the time by ministers, and that tougher enforcement of sanctions could have brought his regime down.

He said he tried to inform ministers about his misgivings over the developing momentum towards war, taking them aside during their visits to New York or having brief conversations in their car to the airport.

But he said he was aware that speaking out too often or too openly - even in internal debates - about his concerns about the government's policy direction would damage his career by winning him a reputation as a ""naive troublemaker"".

Ross's evidence, by video link from New York, came days after Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time, used the first ministerial veto under the freedom of information act to ban the release of cabinet minutes on the decision to go to war.

""I feel very strongly that there has still not been proper accountability and scrutiny into what happened in Iraq,"" Ross said.

""There should be a full public inquiry or parliamentary inquiry into the decision-making that took place. Hutton and Butler are by no means sufficient to that purpose and it is disgraceful that the government pretends that they are... if we had those systems of accountability and scrutiny then leaking and other more aberration behaviour from civil servants would be less necessary.""

He was one of four ""whistleblowers"" who yesterday gave evidence to the committee.

They also included Katharine Gun, a former GCHQ translator who revealed the organisation was tapping phones of countries that were against the Iraq war; Brian Jones, the most senior expert on chemical weapons at the Defence Intelligence Staff; and Derek Pasquill, a former Foreign Office official who leaked documents about rendition and Muslim groups who were hostile to the UK receiving government money.

Jones and Ross never leaked any information to the press. Jones instead complained to his superior that he thought the intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction was being exaggerated but was told that there was ""one secret piece of information which could not be shared with [him]"" because it was too sensitive.

He told MPs that when the WMD dossier was published and he saw the difference between the foreword by the prime minister and the contents he ""thought the intelligence services were going to be crucified"".

But he instead he found that most MPs, with a few exceptions, supported the government. ""I feel that you gentlemen [the MPs] have been either deliberately or accidentally misled and these incidents have not been followed up. I think that there has been a great laxity and that won't encourage people like me or my colleagues to come to you,"" he said.

Tony Wright, the chairman of the committee, agreed with the allegation. ""I think you are absolutely right to castigate parliament, which I think has behaved abysmally in this matter - endless bleating about the need for an inquiry but a complete failure to insist upon one,"" he said.

Gordon Brown has promised to look at an inquiry after all the troops come home from Iraq."

On the morning of June 17, 1972, five men were arrested after breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. The media, led by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, doggedly pursued the story, exposing wiretaps, secret documents, and hush money. President Richard Nixon denied involvement in the scandal, declaring, “I am not a crook,” in a nationally televised press conference. But the White House cover-up failed. Faced with almost certain impeachment, Nixon resigned from his second term in office on August 9, 1974.

The White Sox shocked the nation when they threw the World Series. Nearly a century ago, some members of the Chicago White Sox baseball team accepted a bribe—as much as $100,000 (about $1.4 million today)—to deliberately lose the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Suspicions arose in the first game after uncharacteristically sloppy pitching by the White Sox, who were heavily favored to win. “I don’t know why I did it,” pitcher Eddie Cicotte testified before a grand jury. “I must have been crazy.” He and seven other players, including “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, were indicted on nine counts of conspiracy but acquitted by a jury. They were banned from the game for life.

Many made claims to be the grand duchess of Russia, but all of them were frauds. It was a gruesome crime: In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries executed Russian tsar Nicholas II, the empress, and their five children. But did Anastasia, the youngest daughter, escape? Several impersonators exploited this hope, most famously Anna Anderson, an Anastasia look-alike who filed an unsuccessful suit in 1938 to try to prove her identity—and claim an inheritance. Anderson, who had supporters as well as detractors, died in 1984. A posthumous DNA test found she was unrelated to the Romanovs and appeared to confirm she was a Polish factory worker named Franziska Schanzkowska.

A famous swindler lends his name to a fraudulent scheme that still endures. In 1919 Italian immigrant Charles Ponzi built a pyramid scheme around international postal reply coupons. Ponzi, who brought in $250,000 a day at the peak of his scheme (about three million dollars today), conned investors into sending him millions of dollars, promising eye-popping returns. Ponzi’s scam—paying one investor with money from others—unraveled in August 1920, when he was charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. In 2008 modern-day Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff was arrested after bilking investors—including Steven Spielberg, Sandy Koufax, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Elie Wiesel—out of billions.

A gifted showman, P. T. Barnum exploited the public’s desire to be amazed. At his first spectacle, in 1835, showman Phineas Taylor Barnum touted Joice Heth as George Washington’s 161-year-old nursemaid. Crowds came gawking to see “the greatest natural & national curiosity in the world.” Barnum profited from the public’s hunger for entertainment by planting embellishments and lies in newspapers. His fabrication about Heth blew up after her death, when an autopsy found her to be no more than 80 years old. Barnum’s flair for fake news culminated when, in ill health, he arranged for the publication of his own obituary so he could read it before he died.

Piltdown man, a clever fabrication of a human ancestor, created a sensation. In 1912 fossil enthusiast Charles Dawson and his collaborator Arthur Smith Woodward, a geologist at the British Natural History Museum, announced the unearthing of humanlike skull fragments and an apelike jawbone from a gravel pit near Piltdown, England. Just a few years earlier, Dawson had written to Smith Woodward, saying he was “waiting for the big ‘find.’ ” But Piltdown man, initially hailed as the missing link connecting ape to human, was a fraud: The bones were stained to resemble ancient fossils, and the teeth, from an orangutan, had been filed down to appear human."

In public appearances, he likened the large number of children with autism, which he alleges is linked to unsafe vaccines, to a holocaust.



""I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word 'holocaust' to describe the autism epidemic,"" said Kennedy, the son of former U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.

Medical experts and scientific studies dispute that vaccines are causing autism, but the legislation has sparked an emotional debate on the issue.

 is helping an American geologist to survey large areas cheaply for promising

 oilfields. Frederic Siegel of George Washington University in Washington

 DC uses passive detectors bured in the ground to measure the radioactivity

 of the uranium that reaches the surface.

Siegel used the technique, known as thermoluminescence radiation dosimetry,

 to survey the Shenping oil pool in northeastern China in 1985 and 1986,

 and has just completed work in the Takla area, a desert in western China.

Oxidised uranium is immobilised in the environment where hydrocarbons

 are trapped, explains Siegel. Water ascending through the ground is blocked

 by petroleum deposits but works it way to the edge of the deposit from where

 it continues to rise.

But at the edge it picks up enough hydrocarbon gases and radioactive

 particles to be detectable at the surface. A ring of faintly radioactive

 water is then detectable at the surface marking the edge of the deposit.

To measure this radiation – which is in the form of gamma rays – the

 survey team uses dozens of tiny chips 3-2 millimetres across made of either

 lithium fluoride or calcium sulphate enclosed in polyethylene bottles. For

 the Shenping survey, the team buried the chips in the ground spaced at one

 per square kilometre. They were left there for 110 days, then dug up and

 analysed.

Gamma rays from uranium ionise atoms in the chips while they are in

 the ground. The atoms remain ionised until the chips are unearthed and heated.

 When the chips are baked, electrons return to their original positions and

 emit a photon of light. From the amount of light emitted, the team can determine

 how much uranium there is in the ground and can construct a contour map

 of uranium abundance which will show the ring pattern around petroleum reserves."

However, this list is made up of traders famous for being traders. The lives of the world's most famous traders are colored by both triumph and tragedy, with some exploits achieving mythological status within the industry. The list begins with legendary traders of history and progresses to those of the present day.

Jesse Lauriston Livermore (1877–1940) was an American trader famous for both colossal gains and losses in the market. He successfully shorted the 1929 market crash, building his fortune to $100 million. However, by 1934 he had lost his money and tragically took his own life in 1940.

WD Gann (1878–1955) was a trader who used market forecasting methods based on geometry, astrology, and ancient mathematics. His mysterious technical tools include Gann angles and the Square of 9. As well as trading, Gann wrote a number of books and courses.

Hungarian-born George Soros (born 1930) is the chairman of Soros Fund Management, one of the most successful firms in the history of the hedge fund industry. He earned the moniker “The Man Who Broke the Bank of England” in 1992 after his short sale of $10 billion worth of pounds, yielding a tidy $1 billion profit.

James Rogers, Jr. (born 1942) is the Chairman of Rogers Holdings. He co-founded the Quantum Fund along with George Soros in the early 1970s, which gained a staggering 4200% over 10 years. Rogers is renowned for his correct bullish call on commodities in the 1990s and also for his books detailing his adventurous world travels.

Richard J. Dennis (born 1949) made his mark in the trading world as a highly successful Chicago-based commodities trader. He reportedly acquired a $200 million fortune over ten years from his speculating. Along with partner William Eckhardt, Dennis was co-creator of the mythical Turtle Trading experiment.

Paul Tudor Jones II (born 1954) is the founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, one of the world's leading hedge funds. Tudor Jones gained notoriety after making around $100 million from shorting stocks during the 1987 market crash.

John Paulson (born 1955), of the hedge fund Paulson & Co., rose to the top of the financial world after making billions of dollars in 2007 by using credit default swaps to effectively sell short the US subprime mortgage lending market.

Steven Cohen (born 1956) founded SAC Capital Advisors, a leading hedge fund focused primarily on trading equities. In 2013, SAC was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with failing to prevent insider trading and later agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine.

David Tepper (born 1957) is the founder of the wildly successful hedge fund Appaloosa Management. Tepper, a specialist in distressed debt investing, has made several appearances on CNBC where his statements are closely watched by traders.

Nicholas Leeson (born 1967) is the rogue trader who famously caused the collapse of Barings Bank. Leeson served four years in a Singapore jail but later bounced back to become CEO of Irish football club Galway United.

The dramatic and varied life stories of the world's most famous traders have made compelling material for books and movies. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, a fictionalized portrayal of Jesse Livermore's life, is widely viewed as a timeless classic and one of the most important books ever written about trading. Rogue Trader (1999), starring Ewan McGregor, is based on the story of Nick Leeson and the collapse of Barings Bank. (For related reading, see ""The Most Famous Forex Traders Ever."")"

Four of them are still up, and on Tuesday, another was surfaced at the top of my feed. The captions on all the videos question the validity of the attack and claim that it was a false flag carried out by the U.S. government.

The top of my Instagram Explore page also featured a racist caricature of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, exaggerating her features and darkening her skin; a post about Hillary Clinton being a pedophile; a 4chan screenshot talking about a “beta Jew”; and yet another Christchurch false-flag post. My Explore page was littered with posts containing hashtags such as #PedoVore, #TheGreatAwakening, #WWG1WGA, #QAnon, #Spygate, #Pizzagate, and #TheStorm.

Given the velocity of the recommendation algorithm, the power of hashtagging, and the nature of the posts, it’s easy to see how Instagram can serve as an entry point into the internet’s darkest corners. Instagram “memes pages and humor is a really effective way to introduce people to extremist content,” says Becca Lewis, a doctoral student at Stanford and a research affiliate at the Data and Society Research Institute. “It’s easy, on Instagram, to attach certain hashtags to certain memes and get high visibility.”

Indeed, 344,000 Instagram posts currently include the hashtag #QAnon; 262,00 include the hashtag #WWG1WGA, a QAnon conspiracy phrase; 166,000 include the hashtag #Pizzagate. As of Tuesday afternoon, three of the top 12 Instagram posts featuring the hashtag #vaccines were promoting anti-vaccine messages—after Facebook announced last week that it would diminish the reach of anti-vaccine information on Facebook and Instagram. (Notably, these numbers don’t capture thousands of posts from private accounts. Many of Instagram’s biggest far-right meme accounts are private—a well-known tactic for fueling growth, but also a way to avoid scrutiny from outsiders and to prevent being reported.)

In December, Wired reported that Instagram had become the “go-to” social network for the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm notorious for meddling in U.S. elections. A report commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee declared that “Instagram was perhaps the most effective platform for the Internet Research Agency” to spread misinformation. “Instagram has the power of Twitter to broadcast out, but the infrastructure of Facebook supporting it,” says Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia University who directs a center on digital forensics. “It has the best of all platforms.”

And its mechanisms are more inscrutable. Last year, the company restricted API access—the service that processes requests for Facebook data from remote applications—following several Facebook data-breach scandals. According to Albright, this has stunted research efforts focused on the spread of misinformation and extremism. Just last fall, Albright’s research revealed that anti-Semitism on the platform was rising. He says he would be unable to carry out similar research today due to the recent API restrictions. “The ability for me to do a network analysis or look at how accounts are connected has basically gone away,” he says.

Meme pages aren’t the only types of accounts bent on leveraging Instagram to radicalize young people. As The Daily Beast reported last fall, Instagram has become a haven for far-right figures such as Alex Jones, who has found a home on Instagram. Jones’s Infowars videos have flourished on IGTV, Instagram’s home for more long-form video content, where networks of accounts repost them."

Mr Obama also reacted to the Justice Department dropping its criminal case against Mr Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, saying he worried that the ""basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.""

More than 78,400 people with Covid-19 have died in the United States and more than 1.3 million people have tested positive, according to the latest estimates from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Mr Obama's comments came during a Friday call with 3,000 members of the Obama Alumni Association, people who served in his administration. Mr Obama urged his supporters to back his former vice president, Joe Biden, who is trying to unseat Mr Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

""What we're fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy - that has become a stronger impulse in American life.

""Administration intimidation of witnesses, congressional cowardice, and media caution,"" the authors say. They believe that the ""establishment media"" have not pursued the story strenuously enough because their practitioners are ""reluctant to find themselves at odds with"" the Government.

It is ironic, then, that the authors rely on the very sources they scorn for nearly every statement in this slim but heavily footnoted volume. ""Cocaine Politics"" is not written or reported but rather assembled. The authors have done no important original interviews. Their work consists mainly of information from other books (including my own), newspaper clips, Government releases, court records and transcripts of Congressional hearings (chiefly those of the Iran-contra committees and Senator John Kerry's subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations). It is a sort of treasury of great conspiracy charges, a compilation of just about anything anyone has ever said that supports the central theme.

Just about every ""establishment journalist"" who covers the drug issue, and most law enforcement agents as well, would probably agree with the authors' premise that American policy on drugs reeks of hypocrisy and cynicism. No doubt about it, many Government officials lie, dissemble or delude themselves. Still, uncorroborated or disputed allegations are just not good enough, whether the source is a jailbird or a secretary of state. Using slim evidence to tar hated groups as drug traffickers is neo-McCarthyism, whether it is the right attacking Cuba or the left accusing the contras.

To accept the major premises of this book, you have to believe that (1) most crooks tell the truth and (2) nearly all Government officials lie all the time, and lie competently -- except when they are whistleblowers or prosecutors vouching for the credibility of some crook who is being used as a Government witness (in which case the snitch's word becomes holy writ). You must also believe that (3) much of the evil in the world is part of a grand design concocted in Washington.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Republican challenger says he believes an unfounded right-wing online conspiracy theory dubbed “pizzagate.”

Paul Nehlen voiced his opinion during an online question-and-answer session with voters earlier this month on Reddit. He was asked, “What are your thoughts on Pizzagate?”

In response, Nehlen wrote, “I believe it is real.”

The conspiracy theory claims Democrats harbor child sex slaves at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C. The false internet rumor led a gunman to fire an assault weapon inside the pizzeria in December.

Nehlen did not explain in the Aug. 3 session why he believed the conspiracy theory. But he tried to explain himself in a series of Twitter messages Monday to The Associated Press.

“I believe in the broader possibility that there are those in positions of power to which laws do not equally apply to them, and therefore, I pray (Attorney General Jeff) Sessions unleashes the full power of his assets to root out and prosecute EQUALLY those who prey on children, including human trafficking narco-terrorists, and those in positions of power,” Nehlen said.

In the same Reddit conversation from earlier this month, Nehlen disparaged another person in the online conversation as “amazingly retarded.” The original comment that elicited the response from Nehlen was deleted. Nehlen told AP on Monday he was being sardonic.

Nehlen lost to Ryan by 68 points last year and is seeking a rematch next year. Nehlen ran to the right of Ryan last year and initially won praise from then-candidate Donald Trump, who later backed Ryan.

Ryan campaign spokesman Zack Roday said Nehlen “has consistently proven himself irrelevant” and said Nehlen’s “retarded” remark was “wrong and it is hurtful.” Roday also said Nehlen should not “trade in conspiracy theories.”

This story has been corrected that Trump initially praised Nehlen but didn’t endorse him."

Convincing the people of Iraq that the former dictator’s sons, Uday and Qusay, are dead is critical for the occupying US forces. Since gaining control of Iraq, guerrilla action by groups still loyal to Saddam has continued to claim the lives of US soldiers.

Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, commander of the US troops in Iraq, says that dental records for the younger son Qusay show a 100 per cent match with his purported body. Uday’s body shows a 90 per cent match to dental records due to some damage to the teeth from gunfire.

X-ray records of bullet injuries to Uday during a 1996 assassination attempt have also bolstered the US military’s identification of Saddam’s first-born son. “We have no doubt that we have the bodies of Uday and Qusay,” Sanchez told a news conference in Baghdad on Wednesday.

The pair, notorious for their brutality, were the US Central Command’s most-wanted men after Saddam himself. They were killed in a fierce six-hour battle at a villa in Mosul, northern Iraq. Their hiding place was reportedly revealed by a local informant.

Sanchez says the bodies have been shown to four former senior Iraqi officials, including Saddam’s presidential secretary, Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti, the most senior aide in US custody. They confirmed the identification, Sanchez says.

The US military is even reported to be considering issuing photographs to help convince sceptical Iraqis that Uday and Qusay are truly dead. Pictures taken in the aftermath of the raid apparently show the bodies as clearly recognisable, despite being badly shot.

The bodies of two other people killed in the attack on the villa have not yet been identified, but are reported to be those of Qusay’s 14-year-old son Mustapha and a bodyguard. Autopsies will be carried on all the bodies, which are now at a US military base in Baghdad, says Sanchez.

DNA tests are planned to give further confirmation of the identification. The US military has previously indicated that it has samples from Saddam and his sons. However, Sanchez declined to answer a question about the source of these original DNA samples.

Experts previously contacted by New Scientist say the identity of a person could be conclusively proven if DNA from that person exactly matched stored samples obtained from personal possessions, such as a hairbrush or a toothbrush.

Such a test would compare DNA from the cells’ nucleus – the odds of a chance match is estimated at one in a billion. But the provenance of the reference sample used is critical. “How do you know if it’s really his?” cautioned Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensic scientist and DNA expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.

A second way, he said, would be to use living relatives to provide DNA samples for comparison. This has the advantage that scientists can be certain of where the samples have come from, but the DNA match is less sure."

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and visiting Venezuelan counterpart, Hugo Chavez, watched as officials from both countries signed 11 agreements promoting cooperation in areas including oil, natural gas, textiles, trade and public housing.

Among the agreements, Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA said the South American country was forming a joint shipping venture with Iran to aid in delivering Venezuelan crude oil to Europe and Asia. It said in a statement that the agreement for a joint venture also would help supply Iran ""due to its limited refining capacity.""

Both presidents denounced U.S. ""imperialism"" and said their opponents will not be able to impede cooperation between Iran and Venezuela.

Iran's state TV quoted both Ahmadinejad and Chavez as calling their relationship a ""strategic alliance"" that would eliminate the current global order.

""Iran and Venezuela are united to establish a new world order based on humanity and justice,"" Ahmadinejad said, repeating his predictions that those who today seek ""world domination are on the verge of collapse.""

Chavez said this is a time of ""great threats"" that make its necessary to swiftly ""consolidate strategic alliances in political, economic, technological, energy and social areas,"" according to the state-run Venezuelan News Agency.

Details of the latest accords were not released, and Chavez said some agreements went beyond those put on paper. He said a Venezuelan delegation will soon travel to Iran to follow up on the agreements.

Iran has become the closest Middle East ally to Chavez's government as the left-leaning leader has sought to build international alliances to counter what he sees as U.S. economic and political dominance.

""Imperialism has entered a decisive phase of decline and ... is headed, like elephants, to its graveyard,"" Chavez said, according to the Venezuelan state news agency.

Chavez has staunchly defended Iran's nuclear energy program, siding with Tehran by insisting it is for peaceful uses and not for nuclear bombs.

U.S. officials have worried Iran may be using its civilian nuclear program as a cover to develop atomic weapons. Four rounds of U.N. sanctions, as well as broader severe U.S. and European Union sanctions have not persuaded Tehran to halt the program.

Chavez also has plans to develop a nuclear energy program in Venezuela and last week signed an agreement for Russia to help build a reactor.

Without mentioning the countries' nuclear ambitions, Chavez said his government demands respect for Iran's sovereignty and that ""those who think they are most powerful and want to impose their will on the world respect Iran.""

Chavez's trip to Iran was his ninth as president. Before coming to Tehran, he made stops in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Later Wednesday, Chavez arrived in Syria, and is due to travel next to Libya and Portugal.

Iran and Venezuela both belong to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. In recent years, the two oil-producing countries have also set up joint ventures to produce cars, tractors and bicycles in the South American country."

It openly discusses the topic of brainwashing and criticizes the omission of current developments.,"It’s eerie to have this article, which argues brainwashing is a pointless Cold War term only bounded about for political purposes and with no analytical purchase either on the past or on today, with no reference at all to the recent waves of forced-confession spectacles which are the results of months of “brainwashing” (exchange with another word if you don’t like it), surely the polar opposite of “individuals’ active attempts to re-examine their own ideas,” — whether or not that was an original sense of this word xinao, as the article says it was.

Worse, if you don’t like the term “brainwashing,” then what will you call the violent conversion therapy currently practiced on hundreds of thousands of concentration camp detainees in Xinjiang?

Even if Mitchell is right that “the term is used frequently by ideologues of all stripes to define the opinions of those whom they disagree with as the result of external mind control rather than an independent thought process,” how is it remotely possible to even write on this topic without touching on the massive campaign forcing people at gunpoint, in the Xinjiang camps, to regurgitate CCP dogma and then denounce themselves and deny their identity day out and day in — as copiously documented by numerous witnesses — surely a full-throated contemporary revival of Maoist CCP torture-brainwashing?

The idea of “an independent thought process” as an alternate explanation for why people change their mind, whatever its usefulness elsewhere, cannot be a suitable framework for understanding the fate of Chinese dissenters paraded on TV when their CCP torturers have tormented them enough to be satisfied with their parroting performance, — or, worse, for understanding the fate of the thousands of people now being reduced to broken zombies in the Xinjiang camps.

I would have thought that it should be impossible for any scholar free to speak their mind, to touch on this topic of brainwashing today without touching on these dramatic current developments so obviously rooted in the undeniable – whatever you want to call it.

This article, in purposefully omitting what is happening today, and refusing to touch on how the massive crimes of today are so obviously built on the past torture practices under Mao, refashioned to target dissenters and ethnic minorities today – in effect sidelining such questions by suggesting it is all somehow about cold war residues – to me comes across as intellectually dishonest.

Sorry if I am blunt here, but we live today, and we must face the horrors of today, not hide from them – or hide them under a “Cold War” carpet."

In foreshadowing an open-ended military and diplomatic offensive, secretary of state Colin Powell plainly expects unquestioning cooperation from all countries, great and small. This blunt message to all and sundry is: now we cut the crap. You are either for us or against us. We are going to win. Back us - or you, too, will lose.

These propositions demand urgent scrutiny - for despite Mr Bush's initial caution, here is the looming, daunting prospect of superpower unleashed, of Prometheus unbound. And America's friends must think hard and fast about what they are getting into. Did the world really change this week? For the American people, yes, without doubt. They discovered in the most awful fashion that they were vulnerable, en masse, to foreign enemies; and that their government could not protect them. For other nations that have long lived with terrorism, only the scale changed. But for Americans, the illusion of safety shattered. A culture of impunity in which US governments act abroad with little fear of direct consequences at home was smashed as utterly as Manhattan's doomed towers.

Is the US now justified in demanding unstinting support? Yes, but that support cannot be unthinking, too. It is incumbent upon Mr Bush to define the threat he would eradicate and the scope of the measures he might employ. The options in the shadowy world he is about to enter range from a full-scale, Gulf war-style mobilisation against Afghanistan to aerial attacks and special forces incursions. In prospect too, perhaps, is a return to Reagan era covert operations, snatch squads, secret funds, state subversion, and even political assassination. And as far as can be ascertained now, such activity may not be confined to crushing Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. This uncontained American campaign potentially leads to the very gates of Damascus, to Tehran and even more likely, to Saddam Hussein's Baghdad.

The danger that others will exploit America's war for their own purposes is also apparent. Russia, for example, says it is happy to help crush terrorists, especially the Chechen variety. Israel is already acting as if it had received a green light for intensified repression in the Occupied Territories. Pakistan, pivotal in any Afghan operation, will doubtless want a quid pro quo, perhaps over its links to Kashmiri terrorism. And what will China's price be? Silence on Tibet? In Washington, meanwhile, another woeful prospect is the predicted collapse of congressional opposition to Mr Bush's rogue-bashing missile defence plans.

That Nato, the UN, G8, and the EU have rallied to America's banner is only right. The US deserves every sympathy and should be supported in taking all reasonable measures to find and punish this week's culprits. But international institutions, like governments, have a broader duty in the dangerous days ahead to deflect and mitigate the wilder lunges of this wounded superpower. Whether they can do so, given America's present mood, will give us a first measure of Mr Bush's crusading new world."
145,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,The article does not mention any specific actors responsible for the meningitis A epidemics or the development of the vaccine.,False,The article does not discuss any malicious actions or motives.,False,The article does not mention any threats related to the meningitis A epidemics or the vaccine.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"For a century, epidemics of meningococcal A meningitis, a bacterial infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, have swept across 26 countries in sub-Saharan Africa killing and disabling young people every year. The disease is highly feared on the continent it can kill or cause severe brain damage within hours.

But just 5 years after an affordable meningitis A vaccine was introduced, its use has led to the control and near elimination of deadly meningitis A disease in the African “meningitis belt.” In 2013, only 4 laboratory-confirmed cases of meningitis A were reported by the 26 countries in the belt, which stretches across the continent from Senegal to Ethiopia.

The meningitis A vaccine for Africa, MenAfriVac, was developed in response to a plea for help from ministers of health in sub-Saharan Africa after an outbreak of meningitis A in 1996 infected over 250 000 people and killed over 25 000 in just a few months. The vaccine costs less than US$ 0.50 a dose and wherever it has been rolled out, meningitis A has disappeared.

“We have nearly eliminated meningitis A epidemics from Africa, but the fact is the job is not yet done,” said Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, Director of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at WHO. “Our dramatic gains against meningitis A through mass vaccination campaigns will be jeopardized unless countries maintain a high level of protection by incorporating the meningitis A vaccine into their routine childhood immunization schedules.”

The findings are reported in a special collection of 29 articles in the journal ""Clinical Infectious Diseases"" —with guest editors from the former Meningitis Vaccine Project, a partnership between WHO and the international health non-profit organization, PATH. The supplement, titled “The Meningitis Vaccine Project: The development, licensure, introduction and impact of a new Group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine for Africa,” was sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

In the opening article of the supplement, WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, together with public health leaders from PATH UNICEF Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India, among others, called the vaccine a “stunning success.” As of today, the vaccination campaigns reached more than 237 million people aged 1 through 29 years in 16 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, and Togo). Of the 26 countries in the African meningitis belt, 10 still need to fully roll out vaccination.

“Our partnership allowed us to develop an affordable, tailor-made vaccine for use against meningitis A in sub-Saharan Africa in record time and at less than one-tenth the cost of a typical new vaccine,” said Steve Davis, president and Chief Executive Officer of PATH. “The global community should not risk squandering this amazing lifesaving investment.”

Before 2010, meningitis epidemics were becoming more frequent and widespread throughout Africa, placing a great burden on individuals, families, and the health systems of affected countries.

MenAfriVac was introduced as an improvement over older polysaccharide vaccines, which can only be used after epidemics have started, do not protect the youngest children or infants, do not alter disease transmission and provide only short-term protection. Scientists found that 90% of individuals who were vaccinated with MenAfriVac still had protective antibodies in their system 5 years later. Studies show that this is a good predictor of even longer-term protection that scientists will continue to track.

An added benefit is that the vaccine also boosts protective immune responses to tetanus, a painful bacterial disease that can cause involuntary muscle tightening and spasms sometimes strong enough to fracture bones. Tetanus cases in newborn babies have fallen by 25% in countries that completed Meningitis A campaigns in 1 through 29 year olds, according to one of the studies in the collection.

“Countries now need to decide how best to sustain the protection that initial mass vaccination campaigns provided,” said Dr Marie-Pierre Preziosi of WHO, a member of the team that developed the vaccine. “Our experience from other vaccine-preventable diseases has shown that if we let our guard down, these diseases will severely rebound.”

A modelling study has shown that if no subsequent immunization programme was implemented after a large one-off vaccination campaign, countries could expect to see “catastrophic resurgences in disease”, after approximately 15 years.

“The world came together to create tremendous health impact with this vaccine,” said Dr Marc LaForce, who worked on the development of the meningitis A vaccine. “We need to ensure that we finish the job with meningitis A and apply the lessons learned to the next generation of meningitis vaccines for Africa.”"

That world is the field of nanotechnology, the realm of atoms and nanostructures. Nanotechnology i­s so new, no one is really sure what will come of it. Even so, predictions range from the ability to reproduce things like diamonds and food to the world being devoured by self-replicating nanorobots.

In order to understand the unusual world of nanotechnology, we need to get an idea of the units of measure involved. A centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter, a millimeter is one-thousandth of a meter, and a micrometer is one-millionth of a meter, but all of these are still huge compared to the nanoscale. A nanometer (nm) is one-billionth of a meter, smaller than the wavelength of visible light and a hundred-thousandth the width of a human hair [source: Berkeley Lab].

As small as a nanometer is, it's still large compared to the atomic scale. An atom has a diameter of about 0.1 nm. An atom's nucleus is much smaller -- about 0.00001 nm. Atoms are the building blocks for all matter in our universe. You and everything around you are made of atoms. Nature has perfected the science of manufacturing matter molecularly. For instance, our bodies are assembled in a specific manner from millions of living cells. Cells are nature's nanomachines. At the atomic scale, elements are at their most basic level. On the nanoscale, we can potentially put these atoms together to make almost anything.

In a lecture called ""Small Wonders:The World of Nanoscience,"" Nobel Prize winner Dr. Horst Störmer said that the nanoscale is more interesting than the atomic scale because the nanoscale is the first point where we can assemble something -- it's not until we start putting atoms together that we can make anything useful.

In this article, we'll learn about what nanotechnology means today and what the future of nanotechnology may hold. We'll also look at the potential risks that come with working at the nanoscale.

In the next section, we'll learn more about our world on the nanoscale."

You may think of helium as the stuff in party balloons, or the gas that can make your voice squeaky. But helium has revealed itself to have an array of more practical uses, from essential equipment in science labs to common medical scanners and even scuba tanks.

While this wonder gas is the second most abundant element in the universe, it's a slippery thing to grab ahold of on Earth. Combine that with a meager supply chain, and you end up with a global helium market that's shockingly fragile. From 2011 to 2013, the helium industry faced shortfalls of 20 percent, leading to crippling shortages.

With a boiling point at -452 degrees Fahrenheit, helium's liquid state is the coldest of any element, and it doesn't freeze at everyday pressures, making it the world's best coolant. Superconducting magnets, such as the ones in MRI scanners or crucial pieces of chemistry lab equipment, don't work unless they're bathed in liquid helium. (Here's how scientists are using MRI scans to try and see our dreams.)

For hundreds of millions of years, the decay of radioactive elements deep inside the planet spawned helium, which meandered its way upward until getting caught in geological formations. The gas is constantly bubbling up; for every 191,000 particles of air swirling around you, one is helium. But the gas is so light, it's one of the few parts of our atmosphere that can easily escape Earth's gravitational pull.

At present, it's unfeasibly expensive to pull it from the air itself, so the helium industry rides fossil fuels' coattails. Practically all of the helium sold today is a byproduct of the natural gas industry, since some of the rock formations that catch hydrocarbons also can stop helium in its tracks. Each year, the world goes through about 6.2 billion cubic feet of helium: enough to fill more than 10,000 giant balloons like the ones you'd see at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

Not every deposit of natural gas bears helium, though, and it doesn't always make financial sense for companies to refine their byproduct helium, so we end up with a surprisingly tiny group of key suppliers. Phil Kornbluth, a longtime helium industry consultant, says that only 14 plants on Earth refine helium into liquid form, and they're found in just six countries: Seven of the plants are in the U.S., and the rest are spread across Qatar, Algeria, Russia, Poland, and Australia.

It doesn't take much to send the helium market into a tailspin. Last summer, a coalition of Arab countries blockaded Qatar, ratcheting up diplomatic tensions in the Middle East. It turns out that thanks to its massive liquefied natural gas industry, Qatar has a lot of byproduct helium—so it's now one of the world's biggest helium suppliers. The blockade temporarily knocked out a full 30 percent of the world's helium supply.

The helium market's core currently lurks underneath Amarillo, Texas. Since the 1920s, the town has been home to the Federal Helium Reserve, a massive underground geological formation that acts as the U.S. strategic supply. Amarillo calls itself the Helium Capital of the World; there's a monument to the element in town, a six-story steel spire with a model of a helium atom at its center.

At its height, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management facility held 30 billion cubic feet of helium, enough to meet 15 years of global demand at the time. But now, the reserve is winding down, after Congress passed laws that will eventually take the U.S. government out of the helium business. In 1996, Congress required the BLM to sell off its helium stores at a fixed rate and then abruptly close in 2013. But instead of closing the reserve, Congress smoothed out its descent in 2013, giving it until September 30, 2021, to sell its helium stores in a series of auctions.

“In the past, we were considered a flywheel—whenever there were impacts in the delivery system, we could ramp up and produce and keep enough helium in the system, where the shortages were short-term,” says Samuel Burton, the field manager at the BLM field office in Amarillo. “Now, as we wind down our program, there really needs to be more helium found, more production created, and more secure delivery systems in place.”

The move to close the reserve worries U.S. scientists. In the last decade, the price of helium has gone up more than 250 percent, dealing a blow to some research budgets. In a 2016 report assembled by three scientific societies, some researchers described forfeiting their summer salaries just so they could afford the helium to do their experiments.

New helium plants in Russia and Qatar are coming online in the next few years, but Elsesser and other experts also note that helium is, in some applications, irreplaceable—which makes the need to use it wisely all the more important.

“Industry and scientists are going to be really creative,” says Kornbluth, the industry consultant. “If we get to the point where we just can't keep up with demand, either prices will go up to create new incentives to find more, or we're going to develop substitute technologies that don't rely on helium.”"

During an emergency involving mass vaccination, monitoring vaccine safety is important because:
• Large numbers of vaccines might be given in a short period of time, and therefore more adverse events (possible side effects) might be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
• Public awareness of vaccination programs during an emergency might stimulate reporting to VAERS resulting in higher volume reporting than during non-emergency situations
• The vaccines being used might be new, so safety data would be limited. In this situation it will be important to closely monitor safety to detect unexpected or concerning patterns.
• VAERS accepts vaccine adverse event reports from patients, parents, healthcare professionals, vaccine manufacturers and others. CDC and FDA scientists review reports and use statistical techniques to detect unusual or unexpected patterns that might indicate a vaccine safety problem.
• The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project gathers information on vaccines given to members of certain health care organizations around the country. A system called rapid cycle analysis allows CDC to address vaccine-associated health problems very quickly.
• Vaccine Safety Coordinators positioned in 62 health departments in states, territories, large urban areas and freely associated states carry out vaccine safety and emergency preparedness activities while coordinating with CDC."

It was after midnight in Baghdad, but he was still in his office in the new headquarters of the Iraqi National Congress, the exile opposition group that Chalabi helped found in 1992. As a young man, he said, he spent several years in America, earning an undergraduate and a master’s degree in mathematics from M.I.T., and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Chicago. Chalabi began studying the uses of power in American politics, and the subject developed into a lifelong interest. One episode in American history particularly fascinated him, he said. “I followed very closely how Roosevelt, who abhorred the Nazis, at a time when isolationist sentiment was paramount in the United States, managed adroitly to persuade the American people to go to war. I studied it with a great deal of respect; we learned a lot from it. The Lend-Lease program committed Roosevelt to enter on Britain’s side—so we had the Iraq Liberation Act, which committed the American people for the liberation against Saddam.” The act, which Congress passed in 1998, made “regime change” in Iraq an official priority of the U.S. government; Chalabi had lobbied tirelessly for the legislation."

In remarks likely to enrage Donald Trump, Obama also reportedly labeled the current administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak “an absolute chaotic disaster”.

Flynn, a retired general, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador about sanctions over election interference, which were levied by Obama at the end of his presidency.

Having been fired by Trump for lying to the vice-president, Mike Pence, Flynn co-operated with investigators before seeking to withdraw his plea.

Trump publicly toyed with pardoning Flynn and his supporters mounted a fierce campaign in support of the general, who had not been sentenced, before the decision to drop the case was announced on Thursday.

It prompted fierce criticism from Democrats and many in the mainstream media, met by counter-attacks from the White House.

On Friday, Yahoo News reported that it had obtained a tape of a web talk between the former president and members of the Obama Alumni Association.

“The news over the last 24 hours I think has been somewhat downplayed – about the justice department dropping charges against Michael Flynn,” Obama reportedly said.

“And the fact that there is no precedent that anybody can find for someone who has been charged with perjury [in fact Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI] just getting off scot-free. That’s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic – not just institutional norms – but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.

“And when you start moving in those directions, it can accelerate pretty quickly as we’ve seen in other places.”

The president has repeatedly blamed Obama for the FBI investigation into Russian election interference which expanded to include links between his campaign and Moscow. Last week, Trump retweeted a conspiracy theorist who claimed Obama directed the investigation.

On Thursday Trump said at the White House: “What they did, what the Obama administration did, is unprecedented … and I hope a lot of people will pay a big price because they are dishonest, crooked people. They are scum, human scum.”

The president added: “[Flynn] was targeted by the Obama administration, and he was targeted in order to try to take down a president.”

After nearly two years of work, special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy but did detail extensive links between Trump aides and Russians and numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.

Trump claims exoneration by Mueller. Mueller said he was not exonerating Trump.

Flynn’s guilty plea to lying to the FBI was one of Mueller’s biggest coups. In 2017 Trump acknowledged it, writing on Twitter: “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice-President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!”

According to Yahoo News, Obama told the web call the case made him feel a “sense of urgency” about November’s election, in which Trump is set to face Joe Biden, Obama’s vice-president.

“Whenever I campaign,” Obama reportedly said, “I’ve always said, ‘Ah, this is the most important election.’ Especially obviously when I was on the ballot, that always feels like it’s the most important election. This one, I’m not on the ballot but I am pretty darn invested. We got to make this happen.”

Obama reportedly said the election would be about fighting “long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy [have] become a stronger impulse in American life”.

“It’s part of the reason,” he reportedly said, “why the response to this global crisis [the coronavirus outbreak] has been so anaemic and spotty. It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’, when that mindset is operationalised in our government.

“That’s why, I, by the way, am going to be spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can for Joe Biden.”

As of Saturday morning, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 1,283,762 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US, with 77,175 deaths. Encouraged by the White House, more than half the 50 states are seeking to reopen their shuttered economies, despite warnings from public health experts that it is too soon to do so without risking a high death toll.

Obama has followed precedent in not criticising his successor in the Oval Office in public but reports of his view of Trump are fairly regular. In January, for example, it was reported that he said Trump was a fascist.

On Saturday Trump was at the White House. He did not immediately respond to the Yahoo News report.

However the attorney general, William Barr, perhaps spoke for the president earlier when he was asked how he thought history would view his decision to drop the Flynn case.

“Well, history is written by the winner,” he told CBS News. “So it largely depends on who’s writing the history.”"
151,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,There are no explicit or indirect mentions of actors responsible for a threat or malicious actions.,True,"The article discusses the development of a chemical motor for lightweight robots, which is an action.",False,There are no mentions of threats or negative consequences of an actor's action.,False,There are no connections made between events or specific observations.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Miniature robots hold great promise — tiny bots could help with tasks such as environmental cleanups in the future. But finding a way to power these tiny robotic helpers is a challenge because clean, lightweight and compact fuel sources are hard to develop.

Now, a team of engineers from the East China Normal University in Shanghai may have found a solution: They've developed a chemical motor for lightweight robots that can glide along the surface of a body of water. The findings are described in an October study published in the journal Langmuir.

The chemistry-based minimotor works because of a phenomenon called the Marangoni effect, which describes what happens when two liquids with strong surface tensions interact. The most famous example of the Marangoni effect is the so-called ""legs"" that run down the side of a glass of wine after the liquid in the cup is swirled. Because of this effect, liquids slip and slide alongside each other instead of mixing together. [Biomimicry: 7 Clever Technologies Inspired by Nature]

The team from Shanghai found that concentrated droplets of a solution of polyvinylidene fluoride and dimethylformamide (PVDF/DMF) interacted this way when placed in water — instead of dissolving into the water, the droplet would sit on the surface and spin rapidly, not unlike a motor.

The team tested out the new chemical motor two ways. First, they put tiny lightweight paper rockets and paper goldfish into a petri dish of water and dropped some PVDF/DMF on their tails. The mock minibots immediately started zipping around the dish in wide circles as the droplet spun around like a propeller.

The scientists also tried to use a PVDF/DMF droplet to generate electricity. To do so, they placed a four-armed stirrer that was hooked up to an electromagneton top of a spinning droplet. As the stirrer whirled, it generated electricity. Because the chemical motor doesn't give off any pollution, the researchers said this sort of technology could lead to a new source of clean energy. But, as the arms of the stirrer cut through the water and the droplet, the surface tension of the water decreased, causing the PVDF/DMF ""motor"" droplet to disperse throughout the water and slow to a halt.

The new study was a so-called proof of concept, meaning that its main goal was to see if the idea worked. Indeed, the chemical motors aren't quite ready for industrial use, as the current version can propel a paper rocket for only a couple of minutes. But the scientists said they are optimistic that further exploration of the Marangoni effect could lead to a fleet of lightweight, energy-efficient aquatic robots skimming across the water."

Federal officials declared the contagious virus had been eliminated in the U.S. in 2000; however, infections periodically occur nationwide, as the virus is still common in many other parts of the world. Travelers can bring measles into the country, where it can spread among people who are not vaccinated.

The cases in Florida’s Gulf coast county of Pinellas are the first there in 10 years.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles infections have been reported in over 100 people in 21 states and Washington, D.C., so far this year. Last year, 118 cases were reported nationwide, including an outbreak involving 65 patients in Minnesota. According to a CDC report, nearly all those cases lacked immunizations, and the incorrect perception that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was linked to autism had contributed to the low level of vaccinations in the affected communities.

In the last month, health officials have issued warnings about measles exposure in Minnesota, Boston and Michigan after isolated cases linked to international travel were confirmed. Health officials are encouraging parents to get the recommended vaccinations for their children.

One of the Florida cases being investigated involved an unvaccinated child who was infected in the state, according to the Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County. It was not known whether the child had an exemption to Florida’s requirement for immunizations for all children attending school, Maggie Hall, spokeswoman for the Pinellas County health department, said Thursday.

Two other measles infections are being investigated in a separate Pinellas County household. The ages of those patients were not available, Hall said. They were infected in Florida and live in the same home, and neither had been immunized.

The source of the infections has not been identified, according to the health department.

“We are continuing to investigate, but we would like families to know that their children could be exposed to diseases like measles anywhere and unless they’re protected with vaccination they are risking potentially serious health effects for their child,” Dr. Ulyee Choe, an infectious disease specialist and the county’s health director, said in a statement Monday.

In July, measles infections were confirmed in two Florida residents and one visitor who were exposed to the virus while traveling in Brazil and France. Health officials said the residents had not been vaccinated and the visitor’s vaccination status was unknown.

In recent decades, chemtrails have caused quite a stink among conspiracy theorists who believe that certain airplanes are leaving behind more than we bargained for. Specifically, we're talking about trails of biological and/or chemical agents designed to harm people who are unlucky enough to be in the way. Scientists have repeatedly explained that these trails (which in their legitimate form are actually known as contrails) are nothing more than vapor trails caused by normal reactions in aircraft engine exhausts. The size and appearance of these trails can vary based on atmospheric conditions, like humidity and temperature. Chemtrail opponents repeatedly deny the validity of these claims, insisting that humans are being unwittingly poisoned.

So what's the point of poisoning your nation's own people?

But they are now so widespread that their warming effect is greater than that of all the carbon dioxide emitted by aeroplanes that has accumulated in the atmosphere since the first flight of the Wright brothers.

Worse still, this non-CO2 warming effect is set to triple by 2050, according to a study by Ulrike Burkhardt and Lisa Bock at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics in Germany.

Altogether, flying is responsible for around 5 per cent of global warming, the team says, so this figure will soar even higher – and no meaningful actions are being taken to prevent this.

“Lots of people talk about the need to stop air traffic increasing all the time, but this is not taken that seriously,” says Burkhardt.

And the discussions that are taking place focus almost entirely on the associated CO2 emissions. “That’s a problem if the non-CO2 effects are larger than the CO2 ones,” she says.

“The non-CO2 warming is the elephant in the room,” says Bill Hemmings of Transport & Environment, a Belgium-based campaign group.

All aircraft that burn fuels leave behind a trail of exhaust fumes and soot. At high altitudes, water vapour often condenses on the soot particles and freezes to form a cirrus cloud that can persist for seconds to hours, depending on temperature and humidity.

Clouds can have both a cooling and warming effect. They reflect some of the sun’s rays back into space, but also block some of the heat radiated by Earth’s surface. On average, both thin natural cirrus clouds and contrails have a net warming effect.

Burkhardt and her colleagues used a computer model of the atmosphere to estimate how much warming contrails caused in 2006 – the latest year for which a detailed air traffic inventory is available – and how much they will cause by 2050, when air traffic is expected to be four times higher.

The model accounts for not only of the change in air traffic volume, but also the location and altitude of flights, along with the changing climate.

The team concludes that the warming effect of contrails will rise from 50 milliwatts per square metre of Earth’s surface in 2006 to 160 mW/m2 by 2050.

In comparison, the warming due to CO2 from aviation will rise from 24 to 84 mW/m2 by this time.

In a scenario in which the airline industry increases fuel efficiency and reduces the number of soot particles emitted by improving fuels and engines, the warming from contrails by 2050 is limited to 140 mW/m2 and the warming from CO2 to 60 mW/m2.

But reducing contrail warming won’t be easy. “It’s much harder than CO2,” says Burkhardt, and we aren’t doing anything effective about that either.

“There’s absolutely no doubt that aviation CO2 needs to be addressed properly, and there is absolutely no doubt that it is not being addressed at all effectively,” says Hemmings.

An international scheme called Corsia is supposed to limit aviation emissions. But its plan is instead to offset emissions, an approach known to be ineffective. What’s more, the airline industry is trying to use Corsia to block additional measures such as taxes on aviation fuel.

And then there is the non-CO2 warming. “The attitude has been that there are uncertainties, so let’s sit on our hands and do nothing,” says Hemming.

There are indeed large uncertainties whenever clouds are involved, says Burkhardt, but these go both ways. The study could be underestimating contrail warming by as much as 70 per cent.

The one bit of good news is that as contrails become more common, they reduce natural cirrus cloud formation by using up all the water available. This cuts the overall warming effect attributable to contrails by a fifth."

• Some recent surveys suggest Americans, especially young ones, are wary of a coronavirus vaccine.
• The anti-vaccine movement is capitalizing on this skepticism, including at a recent in-person conference held in North Carolina.
• Top scientific experts have said an effective, widely-used vaccine is the ""only hope"" at eliminating the coronavirus and achieving herd immunity quickly.

As scientists around the world race to develop a vaccine to fight the novel coronavirus, some Americans are still skeptical.

A poll published May 27 found that only about half of Americans would get a coronavirus vaccine, should one become available, while 31% were unsure. One in five said they'd flat-out refuse, according the poll of 1,056 adults from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Many of the undecided or uninterested haven't previously been active in the anti-vaccine movement. Rather, skeptics seem to be voicing hesitance around this vaccine in particular, including related its rush to development, fears that it will be forced upon unwilling citizens, and growing distrust of mainstream medicine and media. Staunch anti-vaxxers are taking note.

About 200 nonconventional medicine practitioners, researchers, anti-vaccine advocates, and members of the public from all over the globe convened for a conference in North Carolina over Memorial Day weekend.

Called the Advanced Medicine Conference, the event marketed itself to people ""who are seeking the truth, who wish to learn the secret to not only achieving optimum health but who want to know the secret to all aspects of life, who are on the evolutionary path to greater awareness and insight and wish to take the next leap forward,"" according to its website.

One of its leaders was osteopathic physician and conspiracy theorist Dr. Rashid Buttar.

The speakers promoted alternative medicine practices, such as restorative breathing and herbal medicine, and expressed their concerns about the safety of a possible coronavirus vaccine.

""They are rushing the science. You do not rush science. That is a recipe for disaster,"" Del Bigtree, CEO of the anti-vaccination group Informed Consent Action Network, told Business Insider Today from Charlotte. ""It has to be just like every drug, two to three years long, at least preferably five years.""

Hope Ransom, an attendee, told BI Today she was concerned about the prospect of being forced to get a vaccine. ""We are individuals that should be in charge of making our own decisions,"" she said. ""So if you want a vaccine, you take a vaccine, but don't hold me reliable for what it is you choose to do to your body.""

Their concerns mirror some of those voiced in a petition that, as of the evening of May 28, had close to 560,000 signatures. ""The so-called 'public health experts' have gotten it wrong many times during the current crisis,"" it says. ""We should not, therefore, allow their opinions to rush decision-makers into policies regarding vaccination.""

The movement has also gained traction through social media

Prior to the conference, the anti-vaccine message was already gaining traction. One recent study showed that anti-vaccine views are growing explosively on social media and could become dominant within the next decade.

Bigtree, who hosts the weekly anti-vaccine online talk show ""The Highwire,"" said he's seen his audience grow about 25-fold over the past three months.

And Buttar, who told BI Today vaccines are ""absolutely, categorically, not based on science,"" has seen his videos incorrectly claiming the coronavirus is linked to 5G technology spread far and wide. They're repeatedly removed by Facebook and YouTube for spreading misinformation.

Some conference-goers told BI Today they attended because they wanted to hear and meet him.

A safe and widely-implemented vaccine is ""the one great hope"" of eliminating the virus

Despite growing skepticism, top medical experts remain united in their message: Until an effective vaccine is developed and widely distributed, the coronavirus will continue to upend life as we knew it.

The World Health Organization's Executive Director of Health Emergencies Mike Ryan has called it the ""one great hope"" at potentially eliminating the novel coronavirus.

Without a widely-used vaccine, it could take four or five years to develop the type of ""herd immunity"" that could control the outbreak, since some data suggests less than 10% of the population has been exposed to the virus.

Waiting that long means millions more people could die in the meantime, as there is also no effective treatment available.

And while vaccine testing and development has been fast-tracked, its acceleration isn't at the expense of safety but rather money, White House top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on NPR. Researchers are investing in multiple stages of the research process at once when they'd typically have to complete one before moving onto the next.

""The risk is not to the patient because the safety and the scientific integrity is intact,"" Fauci said. ""The risk is to the investment and we feel that it's important enough to make those investments in order to save months."""

In them he looked forward to a new world order that would supersede the selfish nationalism that had provoked the conflagration. Pius’s relations with the Axis and the Allies may have been impartial, but his policies were tinged with uncompromising anticommunism. Nonetheless, despite his personal hatred of communism, he refused to support the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Early in 1940 he welcomed Myron C. Taylor, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt’s personal representative to the Vatican, but did not heed Taylor’s exhortations to condemn Nazi atrocities. Instead, the pope obliquely referred to the evils of modern warfare. In his Christmas message of 1942, Pius came close to revealing his sympathy for those “who without fault…sometimes only because of race or nationality, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline.” He refused to say more, fearing that public papal denunciations might provoke the Hitler regime to brutalize further those subject to Nazi terror—as it had when Dutch bishops publicly protested earlier in the year—while jeopardizing the future of the church. Although he allowed the national hierarchies to assess and respond to the situation in their countries, he established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to, and information about, thousands of war refugees and instructed the church to provide discreet aid to Jews, which quietly saved thousands of lives. After the war, however, the pontiff was sharply criticized for not having done more to aid Hitler’s victims and was seen by some as a “Pope of Silence” in the face of the Holocaust. At the same time, it was noted that Pius had much to say on subjects unrelated to the war. In his Divino afflante spiritu (“With the Help of the Divine Spirit”; 1943), for example, he sanctioned a limited use of critical historicism for biblical studies, while his Mystici corporis Christi (“Mystical Body of Christ”; 1943) sought to promote a more positive relationship between the church and nonbelievers. During the war Pius tried to spare Rome from aerial assault. After the Anglo-American bombardment of the city on July 19, 1943, he visited the wounded in the San Lorenzo quarter, whose railroad yard had been targeted. When German troops occupied the city after Italy’s surrender to the Allies in September 1943, Pius proclaimed it to be an “open city” and came to be known as defensor civitatis (“defender of the city”). Several thousand antifascist politicians and Jews found refuge in church buildings during the German occupation. Less fortunate were 1,259 Romans rounded up in Jewish homes on the Sabbath, October 16, 1943. The Vatican managed to secure the release of 252 of these, who were either “Aryan” or the children of mixed marriages, but more than 1,000 Jews were transported to Auschwitz, where some 800 were quickly killed.

The controversy that followed Pius throughout his life did not stop with his death. Though upon his death he was praised effusively by world leaders and especially by Jewish groups for his actions during World War II on behalf of the persecuted, within a decade he was depicted in German playwright Rolf Hochhuth’s The Deputy (1963) as indifferent to the Nazi genocide. More recently, John Cornwell’s controversial book on Pius, Hitler’s Pope (1999), characterized him as anti-Semitic. Both depictions, however, lack credible substantiation. Furthermore, though Pius’s wartime public condemnations of racism and genocide were cloaked in generalities, he did not turn a blind eye to the suffering but chose to use diplomacy to aid the persecuted. It is impossible to know if a more forthright condemnation of the Holocaust would have proved more effective in saving lives, though it probably would have better assured his reputation. Not surprisingly, the move to beatify Pius XII alongside John XXIII in 2000 provoked a storm of controversy that may have contributed to the decision to postpone Pius’s beatification."

In a proof-of-principle experiment they created an ""air waveguide"" that could one day be used as an instantaneous optical fibre to any point on earth, or even into space.

The findings, reported in the journal Optica, have applications in long range laser communications, high-resolution topographic mapping, air pollution and climate change research, and could also be used by the military to make laser weapons.

""People have been thinking about making air waveguides for a while, but this is the first time it's been realized,"" said Howard Milchberg of the University of Maryland, who led the research, which was funded by the U.S. military and National Science Foundation.

Lasers lose intensity and focus with increasing distance as photons naturally spread apart and interact with atoms and molecules in the air.

Fibre optics solves this problem by beaming the light through glass cores with a high refractive index, which is good for transmitting light.

The core is surrounded by material with a lower refractive index that reflects light back in to the core, preventing the beam from losing focus or intensity.

Fibre optics, however, are limited in the amount of power they can carry and the need for a physical structure to support them.

Milchberg and colleagues' made the equivalent of an optical fibre out of thin air by generating a laser with its light split into a ring of multiple beams forming a pipe.

They used very short and powerful pulses from the laser to heat the air molecules along the beam extremely quickly.

Such rapid heating produced sound waves that took about a microsecond to converge to the centre of the pipe, creating a high-density area surrounded by a low-density area left behind in the wake of the laser beams.

""A microsecond is a long time compared to how far light propagates, so the light is gone and a microsecond later those sound waves collide in the centre, enhancing the air density there,"" says Milchberg.

The lower density region of air surrounding the centre of the air waveguide had a lower refractive index, keeping the light focused.

""Any structure [even air] which has a higher density will have a higher index of refraction and thereby act like an optical fibre,"" says Milchberg.

Once Milchberg and colleagues created their air waveguide, they used a second laser to spark the air at one end of the waveguide turning it into plasma.

An optical signal from the spark was transmitted along the air waveguide, over a distance of a metre to a detector at the other end.

The signal collected by the detector was strong enough to allow Milchberg and colleagues to analyze the chemical composition of the air that produced the spark.

The researchers found the signal was 50 per cent stronger than a signal obtained without an air waveguide.

The findings show the air waveguide can be used as a ""remote collection optic,"" says Milchberg.

""This is an optical fibre cable that you can reel out at the speed of light and place next to [something] that you want to measure remotely, and have the signal come all the way back to where you are.""

Australian expert Ben Eggleton of the University of Sydney says this is potentially an important advance for the field of optics.

""It's sort of like you have an optical fibre that you can shine into the sky, connecting your laser to the top of the atmosphere,"" says Eggleton.

""You don't need big lenses and optics, it's already guided along this channel in the atmosphere."""

Two decades ago DePaulo and her colleagues asked 147 adults to jot down for a week every instance they tried to mislead someone. The researchers found that the subjects lied on average one or two times a day. Most of these untruths were innocuous, intended to hide one’s inadequacies or to protect the feelings of others. Some lies were excuses—one subject blamed the failure to take out the garbage on not knowing where it needed to go. Yet other lies—such as a claim of being a diplomat’s son—were aimed at presenting a false image. While these were minor transgressions, a later study by DePaulo and other colleagues involving a similar sample indicated that most people have, at some point, told one or more “serious lies”—hiding an affair from a spouse, for example, or making false claims on a college application.

The question Ariely finds interesting is not why so many lie, but rather why they don’t lie a lot more. Even when the amount of money offered for correct answers is raised significantly, the volunteers don’t increase their level of cheating. “Here we give people a chance to steal lots of money, and people cheat only a little bit. So something stops us—most of us—from not lying all the way,” Ariely says. The reason, according to him, is that we want to see ourselves as honest, because we have, to some degree, internalized honesty as a value taught to us by society. Which is why, unless one is a sociopath, most of us place limits on how much we are willing to lie. How far most of us are willing to go—Ariely and others have shown—is determined by social norms arrived at through unspoken consensus, like the tacit acceptability of taking a few pencils home from the office supply cabinet."

For example, let’s assume an investor purchases a $10,000 bond at par. The bond has a 10% coupon paid semiannually and matures in three years. If market yields stay at 10%, the following would occur at the end of the first two years:

As the table shows, the investor would receive $2,000 in coupon payments, which he would reinvest as he receives them at the market rate of 10% per year, earning him another $155. When the coupons and the interest on interest are added to the bond principal, the accumulated value of his investment is $12,155, for a 10% annual return.

Now consider what happens if market yields increase, say to 15%, right after the investor purchases the bond.

The higher reinvestment rate increased the amount of interest the investor earned on the coupon payments. However, the price of the bond fell more than enough to offset this gain. The net result was a decrease in total return. Now compare this to what would have happened if reinvestment rates fell to 8% instead.

In this example, the low reinvestment rate reduced the interest earned on the coupon payments. But the bond price rose, offsetting some of this loss. The net result was an increase in total return. Thus, the yin-yang relationship between interest rates and bond prices also creates a tradeoff between reinvestment risk and interest rate risk.

The trick to immunization therefore is to find bonds where the change in interest on interest exactly offsets the change in price when rates change. This can be done by setting the duration of the portfolio equal to the investor’s time horizon and making sure the initial present value of the bond equals the present value of the liability in question. In our previous example, we assumed the investor intended to hold the bond for two years, presumably because he intends to use the money to fund some obligation. Thus, to immunize the portfolio, the investor should set the duration to two years. Six months later, the investment horizon will be 1.5 years, and the investor should rebalance the portfolio’s duration to equal 1.5 years, and so on. The intended result: an income portfolio that has an assured return for a specific time horizon regardless of changes in interest rates."

""Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, right? ... But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good,"" Trump told a campaign rally Tuesday night in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""They didn't read 'em the rights, they didn't talk. They were a terrorist, it was over.""

Trump has previously said the world would be ""100 percent better"" if dictators like Hussein and Libya's Moammar Gadhafi were still in power. Prior to the U.S. invasion, Iraq was listed by the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Jake Sullivan, a Clinton senior policy adviser, said Trump's ""praise for brutal strongmen seemingly knows no bounds.""

Sullivan said such comments ""demonstrate how dangerous he would be as Commander-in-Chief and how unworthy he is of the office he seeks.""

Trump's foreign policy pronouncements have proved controversial, even within the Republican Party. He has said the United States is too fully engaged around the world and has questioned the role of NATO and said the United States has been taken advantage of by nations benefiting from its security cooperation and troop presence. Some critics within the GOP have said his policies suggest an isolationist stance in an increasingly dangerous world.

Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, partners among Republican congressional critics of Obama administration foreign policy, carried out a fact-check on Trump's national security statements earlier this year at a Capitol Hill hearing.

On April 19, when the Army general selected to lead U.S. forces in South Korea testified before the committee, McCain seized the opportunity to undermine Trump's suggestion that the U.S. withdraw its forces from the South because Seoul isn't paying enough to cover the cost of the American military presence.

""Isn't it the fact that it costs us less to have troops stationed in Korea than in the United States, given the contribution the Republic of Korea makes?"" McCain asked Gen. Vincent Brooks.

Yes, Brooks said, telling McCain the South Koreans pay half, or $808 million annually, of the U.S. presence there.

Two days later, Trump's claim that NATO is irrelevant and ill-suited to fight terrorism came under the microscope. As president, Trump has said he would force member nations to increase their contributions, even if that risked breaking up the 28-country alliance.

In early March, more than 70 conservative national experts, including former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, wrote in an open letter that they have disagreed with one another on a variety of issues but are united in their opposition to a Trump presidency. Chertoff served in President George W. Bush's administration."

It says the information will be shared with lawyers representing the victims' families. It is unclear if the person's identity will become public.

Fifteen of the 19 al-Qaeda hijackers who staged the attacks were Saudis.

In 2004, the 9/11 commission set up by Congress found no evidence that the Saudi government funded al-Qaeda.

However, a 2012 report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said the agency was investigating Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar Ahmed al-Bayoumi, Saudi nationals who had allegedly helped the attackers.

Mr al-Thumairy is a former Saudi consulate official, and Mr al-Bayoumi was once suspected of being a Saudi intelligence officer, according to the Washington Post.

The FBI report, which was released in a redacted form, also referred to the third person. But the name was blacked out.

The victims' families suing the Saudi government have been demanding for the identity of that person to be released.

On 11 September 2001, attackers flew planes they had seized into New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington DC. Another hijacked plane was brought down in a field in Pennsylvania.

Saudi Arabia has always denied any connection with the hijackers.

What did the US justice department say?

On Thursday, the department said the decision to unmask the name of the Saudi official was taken by Attorney General William Barr.

It said Mr Barr had decided not to invoke state secrets, and share the person's identity with the attorneys for the victims' families.

""The FBI recognises the need and desire of victims' families to understand what happened to their loved ones and to hold those responsible accountable,"" the justice department said.

The attorneys for the victims' families have said the unnamed individual is likely a more senior Saudi official than the two people named in the 2012 FBI report.

""The families are dedicated to getting to the truth, and we shouldn't have to beg for this sort of basic information, or be kept in the dark, about the Saudi role in the attacks,"" Terry Strada, a member the 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency."

While the Navy SEAL team that cornered and killed bin Laden became national heroes, another unheralded group played a crucial role in the successful mission. For months leading up to the raid, staffers from the National Security Council (NSC) had organized more than two dozen meetings involving multiple government agencies. At those gatherings, officials analyzed emerging intelligence, studied possible operational courses of action and tried to figure out what the international consequences would be if the mission succeeded — or if it failed [source: Rasmussen].

In attendance were the NSC's principals, including National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others. Obama went around the table, asking each adviser for an opinion on the raid, and weighed that information. The next day, he gave the order to proceed [source: Allison].

The bin Laden raid was the sort of high-stakes moment for which the NSC was created by Congress back in 1947 [source: U.S. Dept. of State]. When a president has to take action, it's crucial to have well-researched policy options on the table, and experts and advisers who can help him pick the best one. Once the decision has been made, it's vital to have someone coordinating the government's various departments and agencies to make sure they work together to achieve it.

At least that's how it's supposed to work. While the NSC is a permanent part of the executive branch, each president has considerable leeway to organize the advisory group, and shape it to suit his own leadership style and personality. And some commanders-in-chief do a better job of using the NSC than others. In this article, we'll look at the history of NSC and how it has functioned over the decades."

New Delhi has said 511,478 Indians have contracted coronavirus and 15,731 have died from the illness. Meanwhile, Pakistan has recorded 198,883 COVID-19 cases and 4,035 deaths.

Pakistani authorities will reopen the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor for all Sikh pilgrims from neighbouring India. The move was announced by Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan's foreign minister, on Twitter on Saturday. This gives Indian authorities just two days to prepare for an influx of travellers at the border.

The notice period falls short of the seven days agreed by the two nuclear powers in a bilateral agreement. The historic corridor leads to one of the holiest shrines for Sikhs. Mr Mahmood Qureshi said the plan was to allow Indian Sikhs to mark the anniversary of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh, the 19th-century leader of the Sikh empire.

He said: ""As places of worship open up across the world, Pakistan prepares to reopen the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor for all Sikh pilgrims, conveying to the Indian side our readiness to reopen the corridor on 29 June 2020, the occasion of the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh."" But critics accused Mr Khan's Government of trying to create a ""mirage of goodwill"" with the opening of the corridor.

Last November Pakistani authorities brought in new rules to make it easier for Indian Sikhs to make the journey. Worshippers were offered rare visa-free access to the site in Pakistan.

In other words, tapering earlier rather than later. But the very next sentence claimed that some participants were against this idea.

Whatever. 10-year yields, which had been moving up even before the FOMC minutes, moved up further, ending near 2.79 percent, a two-month high.

At this point, we should all be done with theendless parsing of the Fed's commas and semicolons. The bias for rates is higher--the bond market wants to move rates up.

The market is reminding the Fed that while it may control the short end of the interest rate curve (one, two and three-year Treasury yields went DOWN today), it does not control the long end. The yield curve is steepening.

The markets believe there is very little downside to long-term bond yields, and lots of upside risk. It is very crowded on the bias up."

The landmark vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union has rocked global markets, sending the British pound GBPUSD, to its lowest level in more than 30 years. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, plunged as much as 700 points at one point, and Europe’s benchmark stock index SXXP, was facing its worst one-day plunge since 1987.

It is precisely the scenario of which Soros, writing in Britain’s Guardian newspaper last week, warned. The global financial carnage and Friday’s tumble could be adding to the wealthy investor’s bankroll, if reports are true.

Soros is famous for breaking the Bank of England — and lining his pockets — in 1992 with a bet against the British pound, which resulted in sterling’s ejection from the European exchange-rate mechanism.

Soros Fund Management, which manages some $30 billion for Soros and his family, has been scooping up gold assets and placing wagers that stocks will tumble, according to a Wall Street Journal report earlier this month.

In early electronic trade Friday, gold futures US:GCQ6 stampeded to their highest level in two years. Although they’ve cooled somewhat, the yellow metal was still at $1,328.20 an ounce. It has drawn safe-harbor bids due to investors’ worries that the so-called Brexit, as a British exit from the EU has come to be known, could destabilize Europe’s trade bloc.

Soros bought some 19 million shares in gold miner Barrick Gold Corp. US:ABX in the first quarter, according to recent public filings. He also bought a large stake in the silver-focused mining operation Sliver Wheaton Corp. US:SLW.

And Soros may not be the only prominent investor making out like a bandit.

Duquesne Capital’s Stanley Druckenmiller, a former Soros associate, and Paul Singer, head of the hedge fund Elliott Management, have been advocating buying gold to guard against market shocks.

Soros’s exact positioning isn’t known because his public fillings only offer a snapshot of his long investments. The SEC requires any institutional investment manager with positions of at least $100 million to reveal all long stock positions held at the end of each quarter."

Retired Navy admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the Navy SEAL operation that resulted in al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's death, penned a short but scathing letter to President Donald Trump asking that his security clearance be revoked after the commander-in-chief revoked former CIA director John Brennan's clearance.

""I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency,"" McRaven wrote in the letter published Thursday by The Washington Post.

McRaven, who was commander of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command from 2011 to 2014 under former President Barack Obama, praised Brennan and called him ""one of the finest public servants"" with ""unparalleled integrity.""

The former Navy admiral bashed Trump's leadership and said that Trump used ""McCarthy-era tactics"" against his critics.

""Through your actions, you have embarrassed us in the eyes of our children, humiliated us on the world stage and, worst of all, divided us as a nation,"" McRaven wrote.

McRaven's letter joined a chorus of detractors who have condemned Trump's decision Wednesday to revoke Brennan's security clearance.

More: John Brennan: Donald Trump's denial of Russian collusion is 'hogwash'

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called it ""a stunning abuse of power"" while U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump again demonstrated ""how deeply insecure and vindictive he is – two character flaws dangerous in any President.""

""This has zero to do with national security,"" tweeted Michael Bromwich, an attorney for former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, whose security clearance is under review.

Brennan himself bashed the move and called it part of a broader effort by Trump to ""suppress freedom of speech"" and ""punish critics.""

In a New York Times op-ed published Thursday, Brennan said Trump revoked his security clearance to try to silence him for speaking out against Trump's friendliness with Russians who influenced the 2016 election.

""Mr. Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash,"" Brennan wrote.

In a statement read Wednesday by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump said that Brennan has used his status ""to make a series of unfounded and outrageous allegations"" and ""wild outbursts on the Internet and television about this administration."""

And its effort raises an uncomfortable question: What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of the platform’s biggest stars?

A representative for Mr. Dawson did not respond to a request for comment. A YouTube spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said: “We recently announced that we’ve started reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways. This is a gradual change and will get more and more accurate over time.”

Part of the problem for platforms like YouTube and Facebook — which has also pledged to clean up misinformation that could lead to real-world harm — is that the definition of “harmful” misinformation is circular. There is no inherent reason that a video questioning the official 9/11 narrative is more dangerous than a video asserting the existence of U.F.O.s or Bigfoot. A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm — at which point it’s often too late for platforms to act.

Take, for example, Mr. Jones’s assertion that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 was a hoax perpetrated by gun control advocates. That theory, first dismissed as outrageous and loony, took on new gravity after Mr. Jones’s supporters began harassing the grieving parents of victims.

Or take Pizzagate, a right-wing conspiracy theory that alleged that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats were secretly running a child-sex ring. The theory, which was spread in a variety of videos on YouTube and other platforms, might have remained an internet oddity. But it became a menace when a believer showed up at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., with an assault rifle, vowing to save the children he believed were locked in the basement.

To its credit, YouTube has taken some minor steps to curb misinformation. Last year, it began appending Wikipedia blurbs to videos espousing certain conspiracy theories, and changed the way it handles search results for breaking news stories so that reliable sources are given priority over opportunistic partisans. And last summer, it was among the many social networks to bar Mr. Jones and Infowars.

In a multipart Twitter thread this month, Guillaume Chaslot, a former YouTube software engineer, called the company’s decision to change its recommendation algorithm a “historic victory.”"

A fourth man - a citizen of United Arab Emirates - is accused of supporting the men in carrying out surveillance on a host of potential targets prior to the co-ordinated attacks, which left about 3,000 people dead.

According to the memo quoted by The Telegraph, the three Qatari citizens carried out surveillance at the World Trade Center, the Statue of Liberty, the White House and in Virginia, the state where Pentagon and CIA headquarters are located.

The cable says the men flew into New York from London three weeks before September 11, 2001.

Ten days later, they flew to Los Angeles and checked into a hotel close to the airport. They were to check out on September 10 and were booked on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Washington, but failed to board the flight.

The following day, the same aircraft, flying on route AA77, was hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon.

The three suspects reportedly flew back to London before returning to Qatar. Their present location is unknown.



'Suspicious activity'

The Telegraph quotes the memo as saying that staff at the Los Angeles hotel had grown suspicious of the men.

Raising their suspicion was the men's refusal to let them clean their room during the last days of their stay.

The staff had also noticed pilot type uniforms, several laptops and several cardboard boxes addressed to Syria, Jerusalem, Afghanistan and Jordan in their room in previous cleaning visits.

According to the memo, sent by the US embassy in Doha to the department of homeland security, and quoted by the paper, ""the men had a smashed cellular phone in the room and a cellular phone attached by wire to a computer. The room also contained pin feed computer paper print outs and headers listing pilot names, flight numbers, and flight times"".

The memo recommended that the men be put on a ""no-fly"" list.

The September 11 attacks have been the worst on US soil to date. Only one person - Zacarias Moussaoui - has been tried and convicted over the attacks. 



Details of other plotters have never been previously disclosed.

The three Qatari men were included on a FBI list of more than 300 people who were sought for questioning in connection with the attacks. The list was leaked in 2002.

The Telegraph said that the FBI refused to comment when contacted."

AFP - World stocks shot higher Thursday amid greater optimism following a G20 summit pledge to boost efforts to fight recession and a US accounting change that could ease pressure on the banking system.



On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average vaulted 2.79 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed with gain of 3.29 percent. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 index rallied 2.87 percent.



London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed up 4.28 percent, Paris soared 5.37 percent and Frankfurt catapulted 6.07 percent.



""The G20 meeting yielded more talks of regulation, more aid for developing nations, and additional labor efforts globally,"" said Jon Ogg at 24/7 Wall Street.



""But the real boost was the end of 'mark-to-market' accounting for the banks on illiquid debt assets. This sent the banks flying.""



The Financial Accounting Standards Board voted to modify the so-called ""mark-to-market"" accounting standard, which had aimed for more transparency in financial reports but had been blamed by some for worsening the financial crisis.



The latest change ""should give a boost to profits of financial companies,"" said Ed Yardeni at Yardeni Research.



""More importantly, it should take the pressure off of them to raise funds to fill up black holes in their capital created by the original rule.""



""The step could enable greater lending activity to spur the broader economy,"" said Jocelynn Drake at Schaeffer's Investment Research.



""Banks may also not be as likely to take big write-downs,"" she said, while adding ""critics say that altering the rules could make banks' financial health less transparent to investors.""



In London, G20 leaders on Thursday agreed to give an extra one trillion dollars for international credit and an extra 250 billion dollars to boost global trade, as well as setting new rules on pay and bonuses for corporate chiefs.



""A new world order is emerging and with it we're entering into a new era of international cooperation,"" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a post-summit press conference.



French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who had threatened to walk out of the summit if it did not meet his aims, said its conclusions were ""more than we could have hoped for"" from the crunch talks.



US banking giant Citigroup said one key achievement was the ""much reduced risk of an emerging market currency crisis, thanks to the increased funding for the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and commitment to support trade finance.""



Derek Halpenny from Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said: ""What is most encouraging for the G20 leaders summit in London today is the building evidence that the Lehman-related collapse in global demand seems to be coming to an end.""



The collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers last year aggravated a serious financial sector crisis and loss of confidence in the economy in the United States, which then spread to almost every other part of the world.



""Demand for equities is improving, signalling that the light at the end of the tunnel is getting closer,"" said Joshua Raymond, market strategist at London-based online spread-betting firm City Index.



Stocks got an extra boost by a 1.8-percent rise in orders for US manufactured goods in February after six consecutive monthly declines, the latest sign that the decline in industrial activity may have hit bottom.



In other markets, Toronto's S&P/TSX index added 1.47 percent and Brazil's Bovespa surged 4.19 percent.



The rally started even before the G20 concluded, as Asian stocks powered higher.



Hong Kong led the charge in Asia, shooting up 7.41 percent, while Tokyo closed up 4.40 percent at a three-month high and Mumbai gained 4.51 percent.



Market attention also turned to the European Central Bank, which cut its key interest rate by a less-than-expected quarter point to a record low 1.25 percent and stuck to a guardedly upbeat medium-term outlook.



Global stocks have risen over the past four weeks as confidence returns to markets following a number of stimulus measures by governments and a US pledge to help banks clear their books of toxic assets that have clogged lending."

It is widely believed that the US is planning for an attack that could overthrow Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, who it believes is developing weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi president responded publicly for the first time on Thursday, exhorting Iraqis to be prepared “with all the force you can to face your enemies”.

US intelligence reports indicate that key elements of the Iraqi war machine are located in heavily-fortified underground facilities or beneath civilian buildings such as hospitals. This means the role of non-lethal and precision weapons would be a critical factor in any conflict.

High Power Microwave (HPM) devices are designed to destroy electronic equipment in command, control, communications and computer targets and are available to the US military. They produce an electromagnetic field of such intensity that their effect can be far more devastating than a lighting strike.

The effect exploited by HPM weapons was accidentally demonstrated in the 1950s when street lights in Hawaii were knocked out by the electromagnetic pulse produced by high altitude nuclear tests.

One unclassified approach to producing the required pulse is a device called an Explosive Pumped Flux Generator. In this a charged bank of capacitors energises a coil wrapped around a copper tube, which itself contains high explosives.

On detonation, the explosives expand the tube from the back and moves rapidly forward, forcing the tube to make progressive contact with the coil and causing a short circuit. This has the effect of crushing the magnetic field at the same time as reducing the coil’s inductance.

The resultant spike lasts tens to hundreds of microseconds and can produce peak currents of tens of millions of Amps and peak energies of tens of millions of Joules. By comparison, a typical lighting strike produces around 30,000 Amps.

HPM weapons would be single-use and could be delivered on almost any a cruise missile or unmanned aircraft. Future devices are likely to be re-usable.

Military planners will be particularly interested in claimed ability of HPM weapon’s to penetrate bunkers buried deep underground by using service pipes, cables or ducts to transmit the spike. Insulating equipment from such spikes, for example by using Faraday cages, is believed to be very difficult and expensive.

Another weapon that targets electronic equipment has already seen use in the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. Blackout bombs, such as the formerly classified BLU-114/B, releases a spider’s web of fine carbon filaments into the air above electrical distribution infrastructures. This causes short circuits when the filaments touch the ground.

Tomahawk cruise missiles fitted with warheads operating on similar lines attacked the Iraqi power grid during the 1990 Gulf war."

With the Middle East responsible for nearly half the United States' imported crude ­oil at the time, a disruption in supplies was imminent. The country found itself in a similar situation in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina swept through the Gulf of Mexico and temporarily wiped out 25 percent of the nation's domestic production [source: DOE].

In both instances, thou­gh, the United States averted disaster by calling on its 727 million barrel secret weapon -- the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Officially created in 1975 in response to the 1973-74 oil embargoes, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a federally controlled oil stockpile designed to reduce the country's vulnerability to interruptions in its oil supply.

The reserve works by maintaining a relatively stable level of crude oil, usually around 700 million barrels, and releasing that oil when conditions call for it. While Desert Storm and Hurricane Katrina are the only two events that have led to emergency drawdowns, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) outlines several instances when oil can be released:

To avoid overpaying for oil and adversely affecting the oil market, the reserve adopted official guidelines for acquisition procedures in 2006. These procedures direct the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to comprehensively survey the current oil environment to ensure it buys and sells oil at fair prices. Sometimes ­oil is bought outright from other countries. At other times the reserve acquires oil through royalty-in-kind transfers, which are transactions between the federal government and oil companies that lease land on the U.S. outer continental shelf. You may also hear people talk about oil deferrals, which are simply agreements by the DOE to delay scheduled shipments of oil due to tight markets or disruptions in the marketplace. Many times, deferrals enable the reserve to acquire oil at a cheaper price later on.

­While the reserve can currently hold 727 million barrels of crude oil, in 2005, President George W. Bush directed that amount to be increased to 1 billion barrels; in early 2007 he decided to increase that even further to 1.5 billion barrels. So where does someone squirrel away that kind of crude?

On Thursday, The Washingtonian reported that picketers had swarmed Comet Ping Pong, harassing passersby, and shouting homophobic, sexist and xenophobic slurs.

A local business owner confirmed to FoxNews.com that the protesters have continued to picket the restaurant early on Inauguration Day.

“President Obama is nothing more than a Muslim,” “Homosexuals will burn in a hellfire,” “Go back into the kitchen, you woman,” were among the phrases being shouted Friday morning, Matt Carr, owner of the coffee shop Little Red Fox told FoxNews.com in an email. The coffee shop is located next door to the pizzeria.

The group, which the Washingtonian says calls itself the “Official Street Preachers,” had about 10 picketers outside Comet Ping Pong on Friday morning, Carr said. He added that two police officers were standing by.

Comet Ping Pong became the center of a growing online conspiracy theory in 2016 after sites like Planet Free Will, YourNewsWire.com and the Vigilant Citizen publishing stories linking an underground pedophilia ring to the pizza joint. Snopes and other media subsequently debunked the claims and the articles have since been taken down.

But the conspiracy theory prompted 28-year-old Edgar Maddison Welch to fire an assault rifle inside the restaurant in December. No one was harmed during the shootout but Welch, who was later arrested, claimed he wanted to investigate the conspiracy for himself.

""I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,"" Welch told the New York Times after surrendering to police when he found no evidence of children being used as sex slaves.

On Friday, Carr said that customers outnumbered the protesters within minutes, and that the picketers have not negatively impacted business at Comet nor at Little Red Fox.

“We are busier because our neighborhood is incredibly supportive,” Carr said when asked if the controversy over the last few months had affected business.

The Chevy Chase restaurants located on Connecticut Avenue, are just blocks from vice president Mike Pence’s temporary rental property. Earlier this week, hundreds activists danced through the neighborhood with glow sticks and rainbow flags to champion LGBT rights.

A spokesperson from Comet Ping Pong was not immediately available for comment Friday morning."

On Sunday night, two groups called New World Hacking and AnonCorrupt claimed to have ""blasted"" the space agency's main website and email servers using a cyber-weapon called a DDoS attack .

Although the NASA website does not appear to have been brought down and is still in action, the hackers presented us with evidence that suggests some of its systems are still suffering from the after-effects of a digital blitzkreig.

The hackers told Mirror.co.uk that it believed NASA was withholding a piece of key information about the terror group ISIS, although it refused to reveal what this secret might actually be.

New World Hacking previously took responsibility for an ""apocalyptic"" attack on the BBC which took the broadcaster offline for several hours on New Year's Eve .

NASA has not yet confirmed or denied the attack, which the hackers claim took place late on Sunday evening, and it is not yet possible to verify the hacktivists' claims.

""We believe NASA is holding back information on many things, not just one,"" a member ov New World Hacking told Mirror.co.uk.

""The main thing we suspect they are holding back some more information on ISIS that the public needs to know.

""We won't tell the public what we think they are hiding - we will let NASA explain.""

The group said the attack was part of a campaign called Operation Censorship (or #OPCensorship) and was also a practice run for upcoming cyber-assaults against Donald Trump, which are expected to take place on April Fool's Day.

""This attack is a protest and a demonstration,"" it continued.

""We want Trump to know that he is next.""

The New World Hackers said NASA's email servers were brought down during the hack attacks, which were launched by a number of supporters around the world.

NASA is a major target for hackers, as it has found itself at the centre of a number of weird conspiracy theories.

Earlier this year, a group called AnonSec claimed to have hacked classified systems and taken control of a NASA drone - a suggestion the space agency immediately denied .

It is believed AnonSec were firm advocates of the ""chemtrail"" conspiracy, which hinges around the bizarre suggestion that airplanes are spraying the world with dangerous chemicals designed to kill off human beings or stop us breeding.

The British hacker Gary McKinnon is also understood to have cracked into NASA servers in a bid to find evidence that aliens had visited the Earth.

However, he failed to find any conclusive proof of an extraterrestrial cover-up and narrowly avoided being deported to America to spend the rest of his day in one of the nation's famously grim prisons."

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Satanic Temple temporarily placed a bronze statue of a goat-headed, winged creature called Baphomet at the Arkansas State Capitol during a rally to call for the removal of a Ten Commandments monument already mounted on Capitol grounds.

About 150 Satanists, atheists and Christians attended the First Amendment rally Thursday. The Satanic Temple says the Ten Commandments monument violates constitutional freedom of religion rights and that the installation of their 7 ½-foot-tall (2.3-meter-tall) statue showing the 14th century idol seated and accompanied by smiling children would demonstrate religious tolerance.

“If you’re going to have one religious monument up then it should be open to others, and if you don’t agree with that then let’s just not have any at all,” said Satanic Arkansas cofounder Ivy Forrester, a rally organizer.

The statue of Baphomet can’t be installed under a 2017 state law that requires legislative sponsorship for consideration of any monument. The Satanist group removed the statue later Thursday.

The Ten Commandments monument at the Arkansas Capitol was sponsored by Republican Sen. Jason Rapert and installed quietly in 2017. Less than 24 hours after its installation, a man drove his car into the monument, smashing it to pieces . The same man also destroyed a Ten Commandments monument outside Oklahoma’s state Capitol.

The Satanic Temple ended its campaign to install Baphomet there, after Oklahoma’s Supreme Court ruled the Ten Commandments monument was unconstitutional and it was taken down.

Rapert said in an online statement that he respects the protesters’ First Amendment rights, but also called them “extremists” and said “it will be a very cold day in hell before an offensive statue will be forced upon us to be permanently erected on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol.”

There was a significant police presence at the peaceful rally. A small group of counter-protesters holding signs with Bible verses stood quietly nearby, occasionally singing Christian songs.

One speaker — a Christian minister — was interrupted by a yelling counter-protester, but police escorted the man who was holding a large wooden stick away from the stage.

The Satanic Temple wants to join a religious discrimination lawsuit against Arkansas brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. A judge has to yet rule on whether the Satanists can join the case."

The death of bin Laden could create even more instability to the Middle East and northern African nations now undergoing turmoil, potentially driving up oil prices and creating more economic strife for the U.S. and other developed countries.

“I don’t want to sound pessimistic, but I’m not sure [it is] great,” Ruben Vardanian, chief executive of the Moscow-based asset management company Troika Dialog Group, told a moderator at the Milken Conference.

Vardanian said any stability hoped for with the toppling of perhaps the U.S.’s most notorious nemesis is likely to be a fallacy in today’s world.

“Stability is not necessarily there,” he said. “It’s part of new life.”

Vardanian was on a panel that included Pimco Chief Executive Mohamed El-Erian, Guggenheim Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd and Laura Tyson, former chair of the president’s council of economic advisers under the Clinton Administration and current University of California, Berkeley professor.

While the group diverged widely on the causes and status of the current global economic situation, they all agreed that although bin Laden’s death was a gain for the U.S. in military terms, its effect on the markets could be detrimental.

“It might be equally destabilizing to the oil market,” Tyson said.

Their views were echoed by noted economist and forecaster Nouriel Roubini, who said in a separate discussion at the annual gathering of economists and business leaders that much of the world stage will remain as is.

“The fact that he’s gone doesn’t significantly change the geopolitical situation,” Roubini said. “I think the death of bin Laden doesn’t significantly change that.”

And Roubini warned that further increases in oil prices could lead to double-dip recession for such developed nations as the U.S., Japan, Germany and Great Britain. He said it’s not speculation that’s pushing up oil prices as in past spikes, but rather increased demand from China and other developing nations.

“If oil prices rise another 20%, that could create a double dip,” Roubini said.

Roubini and the panelists devoted considerable time to bin Laden and the after-effects of his demise, but the group had assembled to dissect global economics. One key theme running throughout both Roubini’s talk and those of the panelists was whether other nations such as China would overtake the U.S. as the central global economic power and how long that would take.

El-Erian said that while the U.S. remained the biggest player, it no longer dominated the world economic stage. Using a musical metaphor, he likened the current world economy to that of an orchestra playing without the one single conductor that it once had. When the economic crisis of 2008 hit and the U.S. nearly fell into depression, various nations got a new sheet of music.

Now that developing nations such as China and Brazil are forging out into their own directions, getting those economies in tune with mature countries like the U.S. could be tough, especially if oil prices remain high and the housing market doesn’t stabilize.

“Different sections of this orchestra are playing different tunes,” he said. “Let’s hope you can get a conductor. But don’t plan on it.”

Still, Roubini said the U.S.’s economic might remains stronger than that of any other nation. He said any discussion of moving away from the dollar as the world’s reserve currency is premature as it would take several decades for that to occur.

“You could say the U.S. is in an area of relative decline,” Roubini said.

He added, however, that the U.S. won’t see a return to massive, quick growth as in past upsurges.

“This recession won’t be [V-shaped], it will be a ‘U’,” he said. “Four percent growth is like going to Mars. It’s not going to happen.”"

Ohio Teen Chooses to Get Vaccinated in Defiance of His Anti-Vaxx Parents: 'God Knows How I'm Still Alive'

Hitting age 18 is a major milestone for teens, who become legal adults and can do everything from voting and enlisting in the military to working full-time. For Ethan Lindenberger, it also meant taking his health into his own hands by finally getting his vaccinations — without his parents’ approval.

Lindenberger, from Norwalk, Ohio, was never vaccinated as a child because his parents “think vaccines are some kind of government scheme,” he wrote in a Reddit post from November, when he asked for advice on navigating the health care system. “It’s stupid and I’ve had countless arguments over the topic.”

The teen told NPR that his mom, Jill Wheeler, was convinced by inaccurate articles online that vaccines cause brain damage and autism — something the Centers for Disease Control has debunked. Wheeler had her oldest daughter fully vaccinated and her eldest son has some of his vaccinations. But she then learned that she could opt out of them, and she withheld vaccinations from Lindenberger and his four younger siblings.

For most of his life, Lindenberger believed Wheeler’s insistence that he shouldn’t get vaccinated and thought it was normal. But when adults at school told him he should get his vaccinations, he started asking his friends and found that he was the only one without them.

“When I started looking into it myself, it became very apparent that there was a lot more evidence in defense of vaccinations, in their favor,” Lindenberger told NPR.

He tried to show his mom the CDC study and other information he found, but “her response was simply, ‘That’s what they want you to think,’ ” he said. “I was just blown away that you know, the largest health organization in the entire world would be written off with a kind of conspiracy theory-like statement like that.”

Now that Lindenberger is 18 years old and has “a car, a license and money of my own,” he wants to get the usual vaccinations — measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), chickenpox and polio. After getting advice from Reddit and his pastor, Lindenberger recently got the HPV vaccinations and the flu shot, and has more shots schedule for later this month.

“It was like him spitting on me, saying, ‘You don’t know anything, I don’t trust you with anything. You don’t know what you’re talking about. You did make a bad decision and I’m gonna go fix it,’ ” she said.

But Lindenberger was relieved that his dad was more understanding, essentially saying, “Hey, you’re 18, you can do what you want and we can’t really stop you.”

“It has opened my eyes to say ‘I better educate them now. Not wait until they’re 18,’ “ she said. “But I need to start educating my 16-year-old, and my 14-year-old now, saying this is why I don’t believe in it.”

Lindenberger said that his 16-year-old brother intends to follow his lead and get vaccinated when he turns 18, but his 14-year-old sister sides with Wheeler. His biggest concern, Lindenberger told the Washington Post, is for his 2-year-old sister, who is at a higher risk due to her young age."

A month after speaking those words in 2003, Tariq Aziz surrendered to the Americans.

For more than two decades, a rare Christian in Saddam Hussein’s inner circle, was the public face of the Iraqi regime.

When Saddam officially took power in 1979, the English literature student turned journalist was already a long-standing member of the ruling Ba’ath party.

Saddam decided that Aziz’s language and communication skills made him the best man to go about drumming up Western support for a war against Iran. Aziz became the diplomat, the man to talk to about doing business with Iraq.

He was behind the normalisation of ties between Baghdad and Washington in 1984 but he was just as comfortable in Soviet Moscow and Paris.

Things became trickier for Aziz with the invasion of Kuweit in 1990, which again he was charged with justifying to the world.

Officially he was Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Unofficially he was the mouthpiece and negotiator for a regime that for most of the rest of the world had become unpalatable.

After the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq and the hunt for the regime’s leaders, Aziz was close to the top of the list.

It is not thought he formed policy and ordered murder or torture but he voted to support it. After all, keeping Saddam happy was often a matter of life and death.

It was his loyalty to Saddam, whatever drove it, that made him such a hate figure for many Iraqis and brought the death sentence upon him."

The First Lady tweeted about the high usage of flavoured e-cigarettes being used by youth in America. She wrote: “Data shows a high usage of flavoured e-cigarettes among our youth. “It's our responsibility as parents to understand the dangers that come from vaping. “Our Administration supports the removal of flavoured e-cigarettes from stores until they're approved by @US_FDA. #BeBest.”

The tweet included a survey which showed how young people’s e-cigarette usage continues to climb. However, Twitter users questioned why the FLOTUS decided to tweet about vaping on the anniversary of 9/11. One user said: “Why may I ask are you tweeting this out on the anniversary of 9/11?

In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, the president was asked what 'crime' he thought the investigation into the campaign's contacts with Russia would be.

He is asked by David Brody, chief political analyst for the network, what crime he thinks Obama 'would potentially have committed'.

'They'd been spying on my campaign. They've been taping - a modern day version of taping - spying on my campaign.'

Trump said he had known for a long time that there had been 'spying'.

'Turned out I was right,' he said.

'Let's see what happens to them now.'

Trump said that he was looking forward to the results of U.S. Attorney John Durham's ongoing investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, calling the Connecticut prosecutor 'highly respected' and praising Attorney General William Barr.

'I want to stay out of it because otherwise it's going to look political,' Trump said.

'Let's see what they come up with. They don't have to tell me.'

Trump said that he already knew he was spied on, riffing off 'the insurance policy - ""in case he doesn't win"".'

His reference to an 'insurance policy' is the Right-wing theory that the Democrats spied on him to try to find dirt, which they could use if Hillary Clinton did not claim her expected victory.

As ever, he made no reference to the concern about Russian influence in the election, and the fact that eight of his team members have been found guilty and sentenced for their roles.

Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's team has charged eight Americans once affiliated with Trump's campaign or administration, 13 Russian nationals, 12 Russian intelligence officers, three Russian companies, and two other people with federal crimes related to the investigation into his campaign.

Trump instead referenced his 'rogue's gallery' of people he accused of being part of a 'deep state' conspiracy to undermine him.

The president singled out former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, former CIA director John Brennan and James Clapper, former director of national Intelligence, and James Comey, former FBI director.

He said that Barr has 'got them in his cross hairs'.

He added: 'I will say this. If it was reversed, if the other side sat in that office behind the Resolute Desk, two years ago 25 people would have been convicted and they would have been sent to jail for 50 years.'"

The events described seem to be the result of individual actions and circumstances.,False,There is no indication of a pattern in this article. The events described seem to be isolated incidents.,False,There is no indication of secrecy in this article. The events described are public and openly discussed.,"Hours after being asked to resign as president of the Bank of California, the powerful western capitalist William Ralston is found drowned in San Francisco Bay.

One of the first men to build a major financial empire in the Far West, Ralston was born in Ohio in 1826. In 1854, he immigrated to the booming town of San Francisco, a once sleepy Spanish missionary village that had become the center of the California Gold Rush five years earlier. There he became a partner in a steamship company, and 10 years later he used his profits to organize the Bank of California.

Ralston’s bank quickly became one of the most important financial institutions in the West. Starved for capital, western businessmen were happy to deal with a reliable bank in their own region instead of the New York and Boston banks. Ralston committed his own funds as well as those of the bank to a wide array of western businesses. Many were unexciting but essential enterprises like water companies. Ralston also had an adventurous side, though, and used his money to support lavish hotels and theaters in San Francisco as well as the hugely profitable Comstock Lode silver mine in Nevada.

The always-treacherous world of mining, however, eventually proved to be Ralston’s undoing. Having made millions in the Comstock Lode, Ralston gambled on several silver mines that proved busts. News of the failed mining investments sparked a run on the bank, forcing the bank to close its doors on August 26, 1875.

The next day, a somber board of directors asked for and received Ralston’s resignation as bank president. A few hours later, after Ralston had gone for his usual morning swim in San Francisco Bay, his body was discovered. Whether Ralston had accidentally drowned or deliberately killed himself remains a mystery."

An activist Christian group has launched a petition drive to get the Virginia Attorney General’s office and the IRS to open criminal investigations into Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr.

So far Faithful America has collected 10,875 signatures and hopes to reach their goal of 15,000 by this weekend.

“The response has been great so far, more than we expected,” said Rev. Nathan Empsall, the organization’s Campaigns Director. “But that shouldn't come as a surprise given how fed up so many Christians are with the way Falwell and others have hijacked the Gospel to represent their hypocritical own self-interests rather than Christ's teachings of love and justice.”

The drive comes in the wake of exposés by Politico, The Miami Herald and other news outlets which have accused Falwell of, among other things, using the influential and ultra-conservative Christian college to enrich himself and his cronies.

Falwell is also alleged to have engaged in activities that run counter to the Christian college’s ethos like sharing photos of his wife, Becki, in French maid costume with employees, graphically describing their sex life, and drinking and dancing in Miami Beach nightspots.

In response, Falwell earlier this month asked the FBI to investigate a supposed “criminal conspiracy” against him by former board members of the Christian school who he blames for the spate of negative stories.

Falwell, who took the reins of the university in 2007 after the death of his father, Moral Majority founder Rev. Jerry Falwell, has denied any impropriety.

Empsall, who is also a priest associate at the Episcopal Church of St. Paul & St. James in New Haven, Connecticut, said Faithful America has been critical of Falwell before “when he’s made, for example, anti-Islamic statements.”

“The difference is now we are calling for a criminal investigation because there has been this snowball of stories that point out that there is a potential pattern of criminal self-dealing at Liberty University,” he said. “We’ve always known this guy is an extremist and a hypocrite and he should face social consequences for that. This is the first time we’re calling for legal consequences.”

“I’m not going to say Jerry Falwell Jr. is not a Christian, “ Empsall added. “But his behavior is not Christian.”

NBC News has reached out to Liberty University spokesman Scott Lamb and Liberty University Board of Trustees chairman Dr. Jerry Prevo for a response.

The IRS does investigate fraud allegations, but it requires whistleblowers to follow a set procedure that is detailed on the government's website.

Faithful America is a left-of-center group that was founded in 2004 and affiliated with the National Council of Churches of Christ.

Previously, it launched a petition drive demanding the resignation of Franklin Graham from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association for “preaching hatred and Trumpism” and another urging publisher HarperCollins to drop Focus on the Family founder James Dobson “for his discrimination against women, immigrants, and the LGBT community.”

It has also condemned former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for calling President Barack Obama’s presidency “anti-Christian” and pressured MSNBC to stop inviting Family Research Council President Tony Perkins to appear on its programs as a “Christian spokesman.” NBC Universal is the parent company of MSNBC — which is also the parent company of NBC News.

Faithful America also collected what is said was thousands of signatures following revelations in 2014 that the Newark Archdiocese planned to build a $500,000 addition to a retirement home for then-Newark Archbishop John Myers.

Newark Archdiocese spokesman James Goodness questioned the veracity of the 22,000 collected signatures and claimed Faithful America “has been supported financially over the years by the prominent atheist George Soros.”

Soros, a billionaire philanthropist who hails from a Hungarian Jewish family, is a favorite bogeyman for right wingers because he is a well-known supporter of progressive and liberal causes.

Faithful America was affiliated with the Citizen Engagement Lab which has received donations from Soros’ Open Society Foundations, according to the Influence Watch website. Empsail said that since May 2018 Faithful America has been ""an independent 501(c)4, incorporated in our own right with no fiscal sponsor."""

Destiny Church Leader Brian Tamaki, who previously attacked Islam after the Christchurch shooting, made the comments during a congregation in Auckland, New Zealand, on Sunday.

The Pentecostal leader likened COVID-19 to Ebola, Black Death and Cholera - saying the outbreak was 'energised by demons' and 'evil spirits' to punish non-believers.

'Satan has control of atmospheres unless you're a born-again, Jesus-loving, bible-believing, Holy Ghost-filled, tithe-paying believer,' Bishop Tamaki said to a crowded hall of followers.

He said the outbreak is a form of judgement for those who have abandoned God.

'God judges primarily by pestilence, which is those diseases, by famine - which is the shortage of anything - shortage of food, shortage of water, shortage of resources,' Bishop Tamaki said.

In the 80-minute sermon, he said the virus had spread through 'airborne demons' and was a direct result of 'violation' and 'perversion' of spiritual and natural laws.

Among the 'perversions' was a reference to the live animal market in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated.

'You're not supposed to be drinking bat's blood or using snakes and gutting them alive or eating them alive or letting these animals cross or touch each other,' he said.

Bishop Tamaki referenced Psalm 91:3 in the New International Version Bible to suggest believers had special protections from the virus.

'Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence,' the psalm read.

The leader told his followers the 'PS-91 protection policy' would keep them safe from the coronavirus.

'You're the only one that can walk through atmospheres and have literally a protection, the PS-91 protection policy,' Tamaki said.

'I don't care if you don't believe it ... Everybody else is susceptible.'

But he told his followers to ignore coronavirus panic as evidenced with the stockpiling of basic supplies like food and toilet paper.

'We don't need to do that, that sort of hysteria ... you never panic.'

Reverend Dr Helen Jacobi, Vicar at Auckland's St Matthew-in-the-City, told The New Zealand Herald some of Bishop Tamaki's comments were 'incredibly unsafe'.

'People should be following public health advice. I think it is very dangerous and wrong for any public leader to contravene that. Certainly in the Anglican church we have been sharing the message to follow public health advice, and we follow it in our own gatherings,' she said.

'It is also quite offensive, saying his followers are safe and no-one else, which is the absolute opposite of the Christian belief.'"

The move comes as internet companies face increasing political pressure to rid their services of misleading or fake news, extremist content and hoaxes.

Google said it was also is considering new labeling so its users could see when a featured answer is an imperfect match based on a proximate question.

Other changes announced by Google last year were aimed at helping stem conspiracy theories and offensive information from making it into the highlighted results, which Google calls “featured snippets.”

Google typically plucks snippets from third-party websites and shows them in a large box before the traditional list of links in search results. Snippets are relied on by Google’s virtual assistant to read out answers to searches conducted through smart speakers such as the Google Home.

The company introduced featured snippets four years ago to get people to desired information faster. But the feature has drawn scrutiny for highlighting inaccurate answers, with mishaps last year including snippets that said women were evil and that former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning a coup.

The latest changes address queries such as “are reptiles good pets,” Danny Sullivan, Google’s public liaison for search, wrote in the blog post.

Google tries to answer with information “strongly aligned” with the search so a webpage contending reptiles are nice pets would likely be shown, Sullivan said. But users ultimately want to know how reptiles rate as pets one way or the other. The featured snippet for “are reptiles bad pets” would be valuable too even if it contradicts the first snippet, he said.

If Google succeeds in delivering multiple viewpoints in one answer for other queries, it could help lead users away from potentially skewed results when looking up topics such as “is the Earth flat” and “are vaccines dangerous.”

“There are often legitimate diverse perspectives offered by publishers, and we want to provide users visibility and access into those perspectives from multiple sources,” Matthew Gray, Google’s software engineer overseeing featured snippets, was quoted in the blog post as saying.

The display for multiple featured snippets and how they would be presented over voice search has not been determined, Google said."

• Reddit has taken action to restrict a wildly popular pro-Trump subreddit, r/The_Donald, saying it contains ""rule-breaking behavior"" and content in violation of the platform's policies.
• The subreddit has been ""quarantined,"" meaning it won't generate revenue or appear in search and recommendation results, and Reddit now requires users to explicitly opt in to view the community's content.
• Reddit said the quarantine was issued because of ""threats of violence against police and public officials.""

Reddit has punished a subreddit popular among President Donald Trump supporters with a ""quarantine,"" citing ""threats of violence against police and public officials.""

The subreddit r/The_Donald, an online forum that has more than 750,000 subscribers, was quarantined on Wednesday. That means that neither the subreddit nor its posts will appear in search and recommendation results, including Reddit's ""Popular"" feed. The subreddit will also not be able to generate revenue.

Trying to access the r/The_Donald subreddit will now present you with a warning message (like the one above) that notifies you of the thread's quarantine because of violations of Reddit's conduct policy, including ""threats of violence against police and public officials."" As part of the quarantine, users who want to access the subreddit will have to explicitly, and manually, opt in to view the page.

The quarantine seems to be in response to recent posts threatening violence toward public officials in Oregon, according to a message from Reddit that a r/The_Donald moderator shared online. In Oregon, nearly a dozen Republican lawmakers recently fled the state to prevent climate-change legislation from passing.

After the state's Democratic senator said she would use law enforcement to make the lawmakers return for the vote, multiple users on r/The_Donald said they would resort to violence to protect GOP politicians, according to the right-wing watchdog group Media Matters, which shared some of these Reddit posts in an article published on Monday. In a thread about Oregon, one user wrote, ""everyone needs to start getting into shape, sharpening up your marksmanship and learning the ins and outs of all your fire arms. Stock upon that ammo too,"" according to Media Matters.

A Reddit spokesperson referred Business Insider to its platform's policies, which ban content encouraging or threatening violence.

""As we have shared, we are sensitive to what could be considered political speech, however, recent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy,"" the Reddit spokesperson said. ""As a result, we have actioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit.""

Criticism from supporters and contributors of r/The_Donald was swift in response to the quarantine. Moderators for r/The_Donald turned to Twitter to voice their unhappiness and float the theory that the quarantine was purposefully aligned with the first Democratic presidential debate happening Wednesday night.

Although r/The_Donald had never been quarantined before, other popular right-wing subreddits have been banned from the platform. The r/pizzagate community was banned in 2016 because of its promotion of a conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was leading a child-abuse ring out of a Washington, DC, pizza shop. In 2017, the r/altright subreddit was banned because of ""the proliferation of personal and confidential information,"" and the alt-right subreddit r/clownworldwar was banned earlier on Wednesday."

The Comet Ping Pong restaurant for weeks had been the subject of fake news stories claiming falsely that it was the hub of a child sex ring organised by 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

The stories were an example of a proliferation of fake news reports during the election year, often disseminated through websites purporting to be news outlets and quoting bogus sources.

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, of Durham, North Carolina, was charged on Monday with four criminal counts, including assault with a dangerous weapon for firing his AR-15-style weapon three times while searching Comet Ping Pong for the child sex slaves that he told police he believed were being held there.

He surrendered peacefully after finding no such victims. No one was hurt in the incident.

The restaurant had faced social media threats ahead of the Nov. 8 election after fake news stories, known as ""Pizzagate,"" claimed that Clinton and campaign chief John Podesta were running a child sex ring out of the pizzeria.

The White House on Monday condemned the surge in similar politically motivated fake news, calling the stories ""corrosive"" to democracy.

""There's no denying the corrosive effect these false reports have had on our political debate. And that's concerning in a political context,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a briefing. ""It's deeply troubling that some of these false reports could lead to violence.""

It was not immediately known if Welch had a lawyer.

Welch pleaded guilty in 2013 to a misdemeanour charge of driving while impaired, a Rowan County Court clerk in North Carolina said.

Hours after Sunday's incident, the sex ring story was boosted by Michael Flynn Jr., the son of retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be national security adviser.

""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it,"" Flynn tweeted, referring to the leak of emails tied to Podesta during the campaign.

The elder Flynn tweeted the false story a few days before the election as well."

Aerosols can be tiny droplets, dust particles, bits of fine black carbon, and other things, and as they float through the atmosphere they change the whole energy balance of the planet.

Aerosols have an outsized effect on the planet’s climate. Some of them, like black and brown carbon, warm the Earth’s atmosphere, while others, like sulfate droplets, cool it. Scientists think that on balance, the whole budget of aerosols ends up cooling the planet slightly. But exactly how much, and how much that effect can shift over days, years, or centuries is still not totally clear.

The term aerosol is a catch-all for many kinds of little bits of stuff that end up suspended in the atmosphere, from the surface of the planet all the way to the edges of space. They can be solid or liquid, infinitesimally small or big enough to see with the naked eye.

“Primary” aerosols, like dust, soot, or sea salt, come directly from the planet’s surface. They get lifted into the atmosphere by gusty winds, shot high into the air by exploding volcanoes, or they waft away from smokestacks or flames. “Secondary” aerosols form when different things floating in the atmosphere—like organic compounds released by plants, liquid acid droplets, or other materials—crash together, culminating in a chemical or physical reaction. Secondary aerosols, for example—make the haze that gives the U.S.’s Great Smoky Mountains their name.

Aerosols come from both natural and human sources—and sometimes both at once. Dust, for example, is scoured from deserts, the dried-out edges of rivers, dry lakebeds, and more. Its concentrations in the atmosphere rise and fall with climate; in cold, dry, periods in the planet’s history like the last ice age, more dust filled the atmosphere than during warmer stretches of Earth’s history. But humans have affected that natural cycle, making some places dustier than they otherwise would be and keeping other areas damp.

Sea salts provide another natural source of aerosols. They’re whipped out of the ocean by wind and sea spray and tend to fill the lower parts of the atmosphere. In contrast, some types of very explosive volcanic eruptions can shoot particles and droplets high into the upper atmosphere, where they can float for months or even years, suspended miles above Earth’s surface.

Human activity produces many different types of aerosols. Fossil-fuel burning produces particles, as well as the well-known greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide—so cars, airplanes, power plants, and industrial processes all produce particles that can collect in the atmosphere. Agriculture produces dust, as well as other things like aerosolized nitrogen products, both of which affect air quality near and far.

Overall, humans have increased the total amount of particles floating around in the atmosphere, which is about twice as dusty now as it was in the 19th century. The amount of very fine material—generally referred to as “PM2.5”—particulate matter less than 2.5 microns across—has increased by something like 60 percent since before the Industrial Revolution. Other aerosols, like ozone, have also increased—with dramatic health impacts around the world.

Air pollution has been linked to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, lung disease, asthma, and more. By some recent estimates fine particles in the air contributed to over four million premature deaths globally in 2016, hitting children and the elderly the hardest. The health risks from fine-particle exposure are highest in China and India, particularly in urban areas.

What do aerosols do to climate?

Some aerosols, like many kinds of dust from ground-up rocks, are light-colored and even a little bit reflective. When the sun’s rays beam down on them, they bounce the rays back out of the atmosphere, preventing that heat from ever reaching Earth’s surface. The effect can be dramatic: The Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, in the Philippines, spewed the equivalent of 1.2 square miles of tiny, reflective rock particles into the high stratosphere—cooling the planet for two full years afterward. The 1815 Tambora eruption, similarly, spawned an epic, globe-spanning “Year without a Summer” so cold and bleak it inspired Mary Shelley’s dark horror novel, Frankenstein.

But other aerosols, like little flecks of black carbon from burned coal or wood, do the opposite, absorbing heat from the sun as it beats down. That ends up warming the atmosphere, though it cools the surface of the Earth by preventing the heat from escaping. Overall, that effect is probably smaller than the cooling most aerosols induce—but it’s far from nonexistent, and the more carbon-based material that collects in the atmosphere, the more warming the atmosphere experiences.

Aerosols also influence how clouds form and grow. Water droplets coalesce readily around particles, so a particle-rich atmosphere promotes cloud formation. White clouds reflect incoming sun, preventing it from getting to the surface and warming land or water—but they also absorb the heat that the planet is constantly emitting back outward, trapping it in the lower atmosphere. Depending on the cloud type and location, they can either warm their surroundings or cool them.

Aerosols have a complicated suite of different effects on the planet, but humans have directly impacted their presence, abundance, and distribution. And while the climate effects are complex, the health impacts are clear: More fine material in the air hurts human health."

The WHO is warning that millions of children are at risk as the Covid-19 pandemic disrupts routine vaccinations.

Some 80 million babies around the world are at higher risk of diseases like diphtheria, measles, and polio as the coronavirus pandemic hinders routine vaccination programs, global health officials warned Friday.

Vaccine campaigns have been disrupted in at least 68 countries, according to data released by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The interruptions could affect 80 million children under 1 year old in those countries.

The agencies said that the disruptions are occurring at a scale unseen since widespread immunization campaigns began in the 1970s. The countries reported at least moderate interruptions to the programs, with some countries suspending their programs completely. The organizations said 27 countries have postponed campaigns of vaccinations that protect against measles, while more than a dozen have paused some polio vaccination programs.

“Immunization is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director-general, said in a statement. “Disruption to immunization programs from the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.”

The WHO said that it will provide countries with recommendations next week for how to continue vaccination programs safely.

Vaccinations have been disrupted for several reasons. Some parents are no longer taking children to clinics because of movement restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus or because they are scared about the risk of exposure to the virus. Health workers who provide vaccinations have also been diverted to help with the response to the pandemic. A lack of protective equipment means clinicians are reducing the number of people they treat.

Lockdowns and cutbacks in commercial flights have also led to delayed the delivery of some vaccines, leading Gavi to devote funding to ship vaccines around the world.

Officials stressed that keeping immunization programs up and running is crucial not just to prevent the diseases for which there are already vaccines, but because those same networks will be used to distribute vaccines for the coronavirus when available.

“More children in more countries are now protected against more vaccine-preventable diseases than at any point in history,” Seth Berkley, the CEO of Gavi, said in a statement. “Due to Covid-19, this immense progress is now under threat, risking the resurgence of diseases like measles and polio. Not only will maintaining immunization programs prevent more outbreaks, it will also ensure we have the infrastructure we need to roll out an eventual Covid-19 vaccine on a global scale.”

Gavi is in the midst of raising $7.4 billion, which it says will help provide vaccines to 300 million children over the next five years.

In the United States, federal health officials reported earlier this month that routine vaccination of children dropped dramatically in March and April as a result of the coronavirus response. Pediatricians recommend that children still receive their inoculations, even amid the pandemic."
197,False,The article does not suggest any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions Julie Gerberding as the actor who will preside over vaccine development at Merck.,True,The article mentions that Julie Gerberding will help expand Merck's vaccine offerings throughout the world.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy.,"After stepping down as head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) almost a year ago, Julie Gerberding has a new gig: She will preside over vaccine development at the drug giant Merck. The company announced the appointment yesterday, adhering to the requirement that civil servants wait a year before joining an industry they helped regulate.

Merck currently has 12 vaccines on the market, including the relatively new vaccine Gardasil to prevent cervical cancer. The company has eyed vaccine development as an area that can offer it a much-needed financial boost. It’s hoped that Gerberding, Merck said, will help “expand Merck's vaccine offerings throughout the world.” Sitting at the nexus of vaccine research and manufacturing, she’s charged with speeding commercialization of new shots and increasing the reach of existing ones.

Gerberding’s background is in infectious disease. Her 6-plus years at CDC, where she was the first woman to lead the agency, were sometimes marked by tensions within the agency. But she managed to boost CDC’s communications with the general public, particularly in times of public health crises like potential flu pandemics.

The switch from civil service to private industry is a trip that many make when Administrations turn over. Although Gerberding followed the rules, she is already getting flak in the blogosphere for a perceived conflict of interest. Vaccine skeptics, especially those irate at her rejection when she was CDC director of theories that link vaccines and autism, argue that the move to Merck demonstrates her bias—since Gerberding will now be promoting the products she defended while in government. “Bring someone from industry into the government regulating division that’s in need, get the vote or approval desired, then return said official to the private sector again, to reap the benefits,” said one autism site, deeming this “another example in a long line of government/industry collusion.”"

It also mentions the public health emergency declared in New York City and the fines imposed for violating mandatory vaccinations.",False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections between events or observations.,False,The article does not discuss any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"ROME - Brandenburg has become the first state in Germany to require all children attending kindergarten to be vaccinated for measles and other infectious diseases as fears spread across Europe about the influence of the anti-vaccination movement and lower immunization rates.

A decrease in immunization has led to an increase in measles in Germany, France, Italy and elsewhere.

The German government is considering whether to mandate vaccinations across the country. Authorities there say 2019 is likely to be a record year for measles with cases tripling in three states. Other European countries have already introduced laws making vaccinations compulsory, including Italy which two years ago passed a law making 10 vaccines obligatory for children who enrolled in Italian schools, including chickenpox and measles.

Last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency with 285 cases of measles confirmed since October. City health officials have ordered mandatory vaccinations for anybody who’s been in contact with infected people and violators can face fines of up to $1,000.

Health officials say a booklet produced by an anti-vaccine group has been widely disseminated through Orthodox Jewish communities, not the first time in the United States an insular community has seen a jump in infection rates as a result of a fall in immunization rates prompted by anti-vaccine campaigners.

Under the Brandenburg law children who have not been vaccinated against measles will be excluded from attending kindergartens. Brandenburg lawmakers say they will examine whether to add other vaccinations. “In the public interest, individual concerns towards vaccination, which cannot be proven scientifically, must take second place,” said Sylvia Lehmann of the Social Democratic Party.

State lawmakers from Germany's right-wing populist Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) voted against the legislation, noting a vaccine obligation last existed in east Germany when the communists were in power. The Green Party abstained from the vaccine vote.

Brandenburg’s health minister Andreas Buttner says “the protection of babies and pregnant women” should take “precedence over the rights of those who refuse to have their children vaccinated.” In Brandenburg 73.5% of young children are being vaccinated within the recommended time frame of 23 months.

In some Germany’s other states, including Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, school principals have been taking action by ordering children who have not been vaccinated to go home.

The World Health Organization said more Europeans contracted measles last year – 82,600 – than at any time in the past decade.

German Health Minister Hermann Groehe is proposing a federal law obligating nursery schools in all of the country’s 16 states to report parents to health officials if they cannot prove that they sought vaccination advice for their children. If the law is passed, parents who do not show proof of such medical consultation could be fined up to $2,800.

“No one can be blasé about the fact that people are still dying of measles,” Groehe told Germany’s Bild newspaper. “Therefore we are now toughening the regulations for vaccination protection.”

But Groehe has so far ruled out making vaccinations compulsory for school children, as Italy recently did.

Italy’s approach has been characterized by U-turns, thanks to the vaccine-sceptic anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), which is in a coalition government with the populist Lega party.

M5S had helped to fuel the anti-vaccination campaign and poured scorn on expert opinion that insists vaccines are safe and the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine isn’t linked to autism. The party argued requiring schoolchildren to be vaccinated was “coercive.”

Last year, the health minister, a member of the Five Star Movement, introduced a temporary measure to allow children to stay in school as long as their parents declared they had been vaccinated without having to provide any documentation. Italian measles rates then skyrocketed and last year the country accounted for nearly a quarter of all new cases in Europe, according to WHO.

The organization says 95% of a population needs to be inoculated for the spread of the disease to become unlikely, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated for serious health reasons, including lowered immunity.

In March, the Italian government allowed the M5S's temporary measure relaxing vaccination rules to expire, bringing back into play a two-year-old law requiring children to receive mandatory immunizations before attending school.

Analysts say there has been a noticeable shift in public opinion favoring vaccinations since an Italian populist politician who has campaigned against compulsory vaccinations was hospitalized last month after contracting chickenpox and was widely mocked on social media."

Bush famously uttered those words a decade ago as the U.S. government was scrambling to restore liquidity and calm panicky markets during the upheaval of the financial crisis.

A few years after that, Berkshire Hathaway’s BRK.A, Warren Buffett hailed Bush’s comment as “the greatest economic statement of all time.”

At the time, Buffett said Berkshire always has at least $20 billion in cash. “Some day in the next 100 years when the world stops again, we will be ready,” he explained to a group of M.B.A. students in 2013. “There will be some incident, it could be tomorrow — at that time, you need cash. Cash at that time is like oxygen.”

Fast forward to this week, and that day could soon be upon us, according to Charles Hugh Smith of the Of Two Minds blog, who warned that this “sucker is finally going down” and no amount of “loose money” will be able to stop it.

“We live in a bizarre world dominated by magical-thinking,” he wrote in his latest post, “a world in which the Federal Reserve creating more dollars out of thin air is supposedly the solution to everything.”

But that’s clearly not the case.

There are several “knotty structural problems” that he says can’t be helped by an accommodative monetary policy, including unsupportable pensions, mounting consumer debt, a health-care system that’s bankrupting the country, outrageous student loan debt, funding unwinnable wars, etc.

The “loose money” approach is actually “metastasizing” a new set of problems that will ultimately “bring this sucker down.” All that free-flowing Fed cash is nothing more than “socially useless financial activity” that, he says, enriches a few at the top and leaves the rest of the country behind.

It all adds up to what Smith sees as the same “toxic concoction” that has led to the destruction of economies throughout history.

“The great karmic irony is [the banks and financiers] rigged and gamed the system so rapaciously, absolutely confident there’s no end to the loose money, that they’ve overlooked the increasing fragility of the entire system they’ve ruthlessly exploited,” he wrote. “This sucker is going down, and sooner than we think.”

DES MOINES — Jill Stein, the Green Party's candidate for president, said Sunday in Iowa that she would not have assassinated Osama bin Laden but would have brought him to justice for his role in the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.

“I think assassinations ... they’re against international law to start with and to that effect, I think I would not have assassinated Osama bin Laden but would have captured him and brought him to trial,” said Stein.

Bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda, was shot and killed by U.S. special forces during a raid at a residence in Pakistan in 2011. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, and a failed attack that downed a passenger jet in Pennsylvania, killed nearly 3,000 people. Today, tens of thousands of people have become ill and thousands have died from illnesses attributed to the attacks.

Stein made her comments in an interview before her first Iowa campaign appearance, a rally that attracted more than 150 on the grounds of the Iowa State Capitol. The organizer and several of the speakers were former national delegates of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. During the rally, Stein argued for a renewable energy and jobs program that she says would eliminate fossil fuel use in the U.S. by 2030.

She has called for deep cuts in military spending as a way to pay for domestic programs, including having the federal government assume $1.5 trillion in student debt. During her rally remarks, she referred to both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as “war mongers.”

She said the 9/11 attacks “provided a pretext for the wrong wars, which have only gotten us into more trouble.” Stein said rather than go to war, she would take a “targeted” approach to tracking down terrorists and bringing them to justice for crimes against humanity.

“I think all evidence certainly points to bin Laden, but the 9/11 attackers had assistance and funding and bin Laden had assistance and funding,” she said. Stein cited a recent article by former Sen. Bob Graham of Florida in The New York Times that noted the still-murky role of Saudi Arabia in assisting terrorists.

“What we should have done is declare this a crime against humanity and pursued it, pursued the attackers and gotten the intelligence about who was behind this,” she said.

She said the United States and Saudi Arabia armed and trained warlords and other rebels as a way to combat the Soviet Union and that led to the creation of today’s jihadist movement. “And boy, did it backfire; I mean, in a horrific and tragic way,” she said.

Stein has been polling at 2% to 3% in Iowa. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who has polled as high as 12% in Iowa, made his first Iowa campaign appearance last weekend in Des Moines.

Stein, like Johnson, worked to make a case for her inclusion in the upcoming presidential debates. The debate rules admit only candidates who average 15% in five national polls — in other words, only Trump and Clinton. Stein, who said she was arrested during her 2012 campaign by entering a presidential debate hall uninvited, called for supporters to protest the Sept. 26 debate at Hofstra University in New York.

Stein has an arrest warrant against her this year for misdemeanor charges related to her participation in a protest of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in North Dakota. She said a court date is pending and she plans to plead guilty and pay a fine. Asked whether she expected to be arrested again at the debate protest, she said she does."

The World Health Organisation now declares vaccine hesitancy to be one of the 10 biggest global threats to health.

A recent study by Queen Mary University found a link between the rise of populism and increasing vaccine hesitancy, while a US study found that bots have been skewing online debate and upending consensus about vaccine safety - resulting in Facebook banning anti-vaxx ads. But is that enough?

Sandgren came under scrutiny earlier this week when he was asked in a post-match press conference Monday about links to the alt-right movement on his Twitter account, including a retweet earlier this month of an alt-right personality and past comments about a debunked conspiracy theory widely known as ""Pizzagate.""

Asked Monday about some of the alt-right ties on his Twitter account, Sandgren told reporters that he ""find(s) some of the content interesting"" but does not ascribe to alt-right views. On Tuesday, he deleted all of his tweets since 2016.

After Wednesday's loss, he opened his post-match press conference by reading the following statement.

“You seek to put people in these little boxes so that you can order the world in your already assumed preconceived ideas. You strip away any individuality for the sake of demonizing by way of the collective.

“With a handful of follows and some likes on Twitter, my fate has been sealed in your minds. To write an edgy story, to create sensationalist coverage, there are a few lengths you wouldn't go to mark me as the man you desperately want me to be.

“You would rather perpetuate propaganda machines instead of researching information from a host of angles and perspectives while being willing to learn, change, and grow. You dehumanize with pen and paper and turn neighbor against neighbor. In so doing, you may actually find you're hastening the hell you wish to avoid, the hell we all wish to avoid.

“It is my firm belief that the highest value must be placed on the virtue of each individual, regardless of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. It's my job to continue on this journey with the goal of becoming the best me I can and to embody the love Christ has for me, for I answer to Him and Him alone.

“I'll take questions about the match, if you guys don't mind. Thank you. If you have any questions about the match.”

Sandgren, the 97th-ranked player in the world, lost in straight sets Wednesday to Chung, who will face Roger Federer in the semifinals. The 26-year-old Tennessee native was the last American remaining in the singles draw before his ouster.

In fact, 85 % of the population is effectively vaccinated and will be protected against infection for life.

Sera has been systematically collected from mice and rats either harbouring a schistosome infection, or vaccinated with the isolated membrane preparation.

Of these, all but five (0.6 %) had been vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to the cruise.

Seroprevalence was somewhat lower in the vaccinated age groups, but still sufficient to maintain herd immunity.

Whether the frequency of these viruses increased in our vaccinated study population cannot be determined, nor can their effect on vaccine efficacy.

Four infants whose vaccination had not been completed at the time of pertussis were vaccinated shortly thereafter.

Among vaccinated groups, the loss rate was 18.8 %, which was significantly higher than 13.8 % of the mixture of natural and vaccine-induced immunity groups.

These findings may have important implications for influenza vaccination policies and encourage long-term survey of annually vaccinated individuals.

This indicates that all factors besides these influenced the number of days in hospital for vaccinated persons compared with unvaccinated.

The vaccinated cohort had a significantly higher frequency of chronic lung and myocardial diseases, as well as other chronic diseases, than the unvaccinated cohort.

We could not clearly pinpoint the cause of the outbreak and cannot anticipate how often outbreaks will occur among the vaccinated population."

Edward Snowden shut down the conspiracy theory that the US government is secretly harboring aliens at its top secret facilities during an episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, which aired on Wednesday.

Snowden, an American whistleblower who revealed details of classified US government surveillance programs in 2013, addressed rumors about secret extraterrestrial lifeforms in his recently released memoir ""Permanent Record.""

""I know, Joe, I know you want there to be aliens,"" he said. ""I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly wants there to be aliens. And there probably are, right?""

Speaking to Rogan from Russia, where he has been granted asylum, Snowden said as far as he knew the US government has not made contact with aliens and is not housing them at their facilities, like that of Area 51 in Nevada.

""But the idea that we're hiding them — if we are hiding them — I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups. I couldn't find anything,"" he asserted.

He said, he found no evidence of extraterrestrial life during his time spent snooping through government databases when he worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

""Everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life make sense,"" he told Rogan. ""It helps us believe that somebody is in control, that somebody is calling the shots.""

In his book, which came out last month, Snowden shut down other popular conspiracy theories, like the idea that the US faked the moon landing, or that climate science is a hoax.

""For the record, as far as I could tell, aliens have never contacted Earth, or at least they haven't contacted US intelligence,"" he wrote.

""Yes, man really did land on the moon. Climate change is real. Chemtrails are not a thing,"" he added."

Twelve million vulnerable people, including pensioners and children with asthma, cancer, diabetes, heart and kidney problems, have been given flu jabs this winter.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said that medical advisers to the Government were satisfied there is no risk to adults from thiomersal and only a ' hypothetical risk' to children.

'Following recommendations both U.S. and European manufacturers are actively developing research programmes to eliminate, substitute or reduce thiomersal in vaccines,' he said.

' They have not recommended withdrawing any vaccines currently in use. This is purely a precaution.

'There is no convincing evidence of harm to anyone, including infants and pregnant women, caused by small amounts of thiomersal in flu vaccines, and the benefits of flu vaccine outweigh any hypothetical risks posed by thiomersal.'

But Jackie Fletcher of the campaign group JABS, which represents families who claim their children have been damaged by vaccines, said: 'The jury may still be out on the links between mercury in vaccines and brain damage, but surely the Government should err on the side of caution? Thiomersal-free flu jabs are available and people, particularly children, should be offered these.'

Four flu jab brands contain thiomersal, which acts as a preservative to prevent contamination, the Department of Health said yesterday.

They include Fluvirin, manufactured by Liverpool- based Evans Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Powderject Pharmaceuticals, owned by Labour donor Dr Paul Drayson.

The other brands containing thiomersal are Fluarix by GlaxoSmithKline, Influvac by Solvay Health Care and Agrippal by Wyeth.

Mercury-free flu jab brands available on the NHS are Begrivac from Wyeth, Inflexal V distributed by Masta, and Inactivated influenza split virion BP, manufactured by Aventis Pasteur.

In 2001 the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products advised doctors to use only vaccines without thiomersal for toddlers and infants, who are thought to be more likely to suffer harm from exposure to mercury.

This followed a 1999 announcement by the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that thiomersal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines as a precaution.

A study by the American Institute of Medicine concluded that a link between thiomersal in vaccines and neuro- developmental disorders --including autism - was 'biologically plausible'.

In a related U.S. study, researchers found a 'statistically significant' association between thiomersal in vaccines and children with problems such as attention deficit disorder and speech and language learning delays."

From today, public authorities including schools, prisons and NHS trusts will have a legal duty to prevent extremist radicalisation taking place within their walls. Well in these confused times we're all bewildered in knowing how best to tackle extremism, whether religious or ideological.

Some years ago I attended an inter-faith occasion where ministers from various world faiths read in turn some verses which each had chosen from their sacred scriptures. An Iman, a Hindu priest and the vicar who was hosting the occasion each read some uplifting verses. So far so good.

Then the vicar explained that, sadly, the Jewish rabbi who'd wanted to be with us was ill, but that he'd sent his chosen verses to be read out. They were from Psalm 137 ""You devastator! Happy shall they be who pay you back what you have done to us! Happy shall they be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock!"" There was a stunned silence.

A couple of weeks later I met the rabbi at another gathering and asked him, ""why ever did you choose that lamentable psalm when there are so many inspiring verses in the Hebrew scriptures which you could have chosen? "" ""That's the point"", he said, ""All world faiths have irenic passages in their scriptures, but the truth is that all our scriptures also have difficult, or even scandalous passages, and we won't make real progress in inter-faith relationships until we have the courage to discuss those with one another.""

As a Christian, it made me think of the leader of the Jonestown community, who, before they committed mass suicide, was fond of quoting to the Christian followers of his extremist sect the words from St Luke's gospel, ""Whoever does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters cannot be my disciple"".

It's commonly said that people committing atrocities are not real members of the faith that they're dying for or killing for. But that is certainly not their own understanding; they're feeding on certain verses in their sacred scriptures or events in their faith history which encourage them to act in extreme or even violent ways. Well the truth is that any world faith doesn’t have a single colour to its understanding of God and the world, it’s a spectrum of colours. That's why it's difficult to put our finger on what is real Christianity, or real Islam, or real Judaism, or even real Britishness. The religious or political extremist focuses on just one of the colours and pushes it to excess or even destruction.

To combat extremism we need to encourage one another to be open to the total breadth of our faith inheritance, however uncomfortable that may be. By having an honest conversation about the difficult parts of scripture within our faith communities, those people who use them to justify violence today might find it harder to hide behind them tomorrow."

Well, I have news for Weigel.

To non-Catholics, the majority of us, the Pope’s claim that he speaks with the voice of God is outrageous. He may be a kind and decent man, but he is no more than that. He is a man. Elected to office by other men. Catholic women, a great many of whom are pro-birth control, had no say in his election.

As for Weigel’s claim that our President’s stance on population control is dictatorial, this is arrogance on a monumental level. It is the Catholic Church’s dictum on birth control that is dictatorial. “Increase and multiply” is bringing this planet to ruin and if allowed to continue will starve the world back to the Dark Ages.

Clinton is right. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church are dead wrong on this issue.

Weigel’s commentary (“A Deep Split Between the U.S. and the Vatican”) was mistitled. The real split on population policy is between the Vatican and virtually everyone else, including population experts, governments, global health advocates, and citizens of every nation who care about democracy and autonomy--not to mention practicing Catholics, who overwhelmingly reject the church’s teachings on birth control, and who do not believe in imposing narrow church doctrine on the rest of the world.

Contrary to Weigel’s assertion, the draft document for the Cairo conference is not “bitterly contested” except by representatives of the Holy See and a very few fundamentalist regimes. All other delegates are united behind the draft’s realistic, compassionate and empowering approach to improving women’s status, protecting individual rights, and expanding access to reproductive health care. To describe this consensus with shrieking epithets like “soft totalitarianism,” “eugenic fevers,” and “a truly Orwellian move” is preposterous.

Weigel says it’s a tragedy that Bill Clinton won’t kowtow to what he calls “the world’s greatest moral authority.” Never mind his offensive chauvinism and the fact that millions of people seek moral authority elsewhere. Never mind that poll after poll shows that even most Catholics feel the Pope doesn’t speak for them on matters of reproduction. The real tragedy would be if a politically motivated cadre of religious radicals succeeded in derailing the most progressive and promising approach to population in history. Fortunately, the collective conscience of women’s and population advocates worldwide will not allow that to happen.

I just wanted to applaud you for publishing Weigel’s politically incorrect, but penetratingly sound article. Weigel’s point--that the Western World is arrogantly and immorally exporting the failed notions of its sexual revolution to the Third World--gets little play in the big media. Thanks for giving it some."

For example, if a speculator believes XYZ Company stock is overpriced, they may short the stock, wait for the price to fall, and make a profit. It's possible to speculate on virtually every security, though speculation is especially concentrated in the commodities, futures, and derivatives markets.

But to really understand speculation, one must understand how it differs from hedging. Let's consider an example: let's assume part of your investment portfolio includes shares of Company XYZ, which manufactures autos. Because the auto industry is cyclical, Company XYZ shares will probably decline if the economy starts to deteriorate.

If you want to protect this investment -- that is, you want to hedge your investment -- one way to do that is to buy defensive stocks. You may choose ""noncyclicals,"" or companies that sell basic necessities like toothpaste or toilet paper. During economic slumps, these stocks tend to hold or increase their value, which could offset the loss in value of the XYZ shares.

A speculator wouldn't follow this strategy. If a speculator purchased food-company stocks, he would do so because he simply believes the stock is going to increase.

Speculation can increase short-term volatility (and thus, risk). It can inflate prices and lead to bubbles, as was the case in the 2005-2006 real estate market in the United States. Speculators who were betting that home prices would continue to increase purchased houses (often using leverage) intending to ""flip"" them for a profit. This increased the demand for housing, which raised prices further, eventually taking them beyond the ""true value"" of the real estate in many markets. The frenzied selling that ensued is typical for speculative markets."

With Iraq still under coalition occupation, as far as Iraqis are concerned the rope around Saddam's neck was American. The Shi'a and the Kurds may not care whose rope it is � they just wanted the man dead and their pound of revenge. But for the Sunni, Saddam will become an instant martyr.

You'd be hard pressed to find a Sunni � or for that matter anyone else � who thinks Saddam's trial was fair or impartial. The Coalition Provisional Authority, the institution dedicated to dismantling Saddam's regime, established Saddam's tribunal. Its first head was the nephew of Ahmad Chalabi, the Iraqi exile who dedicated his life to destroying Saddam. The tribunal's presiding judge is a Kurd from Halabjah, the Kurdish city Saddam gassed in 1988. How could the man vote other than to execute Saddam and still expect to go home to Kurdistan?

The list goes on. Iraq's judiciary clearly is not independent � the Shi'a-led council of ministers has appointed and removed the tribunal's judges according to political whim. Saddam's trial was conducted inside the Green Zone, protected by American forces and paid for by American money. The U.S. Department of Justice was integral to the prosecution's investigation and training the tribunal's judges and lawyers.

Sunnis aren't alone in their view of the trial. Europe refused to participate in it because it believed the trial could not be fair and his execution would be a foregone conclusion. The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers of the Human Rights Council issued a press statement that the tribunal is illegitimate.

It doesn't matter to the Sunni that Saddam was guilty of the crime he was charged with: the massacre of 140 Shi'a villagers in 1982 in reprisal for an attempt on Saddam's life. At the risk of oversimplification, the Sunnis think the Shi'a villagers deserved it. It was that kind of rough justice that Saddam used to keep Iraq together.

Nor do the Sunni care that Saddam was guilty of a lot more bloodshed, from gassing the Kurds at Halabjah to the invasion of Kuwait. Nor do they care he was a catastrophically incompetent leader who more than the United States led to their downfall.

All they care about is this: as the current war grinds on, as Iraq's death toll starts to approach Saddam's deadly legacy, as the Sunnis lose more and more of their power, as memories fade, Iraq's Sunni will think of Saddam's rule as a golden era. They'll remember Saddam as the leader who kept Iraq together, kept them on top and prosperous, kept the Shi'a and the Kurds in their place, and kept the Iranians from invading during the Iran-Iraq war. They may never look at Saddam as Saladin, the Muslim general who liberated Jerusalem in 1187. But when the rough edges do wear off, Sunnis will look at Saddam as a martyr.

That’s not in the cards anytime soon.

After states began to reopen their economies in May, more people went back to work, consumer spending increased and Americans grew more confident that the worst of a coronavirus-induced recession was over.

More good news is on the way.

Retail sales are expected to rebound smartly in May from a record 16.4% drop in April. Wall Street economists forecast a 5.4% snapback when the report is released next Tuesday. Another gauge of industrial production the same day is also likely to show a rebound.

The rebound comes as no surprise. There’s a lot of pentup demand from consumers and businesses after a few months of the economy being almost entirely locked down. Now that businesses are reopening and people are moving about more, they can spend some of the money they had been involuntarily forced to save.

“The opening of more businesses — especially retail stores and restaurants — will prompt more consumers’ to open their wallets as they unleash a wave of pent-up demand that has been building in some parts of the country since mid-March,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist of Bank of the West.

Higher retail sales alone, however, can be misleading. What matters even more is what consumers are buying or spending their money on.

Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said a more telling tale about the strength of a nascent recovery is how much people spend on “the wants and not the needs.”

Examples: Dining out or takeout, home furnishings and hobby items such as books, music or sporting goods.

“People want to go out,” she noted. “That speaks volumes about consumer confidence.”

Yet what happens after the pentup demand is met?

“A lot depends on how things progress from here,” said senior economist Sam Bullard of Wells Fargo, referring to efforts to contain the coronavirus and find treatments. The federal government’s willingness to keep providing benefits to millions Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic is also critical.

Bullard also pointed to the substantial amount of forced savings as another pool of money from which households can draw. Families have spent more on food, but they’ve hardly spent anything on clothes, gas, transportation, haircuts and other goods and services they normally would have purchased during the lockdown.

Read: Consumer prices drop again as pandemic cuts rate of inflation to near zero

Yet the economy can’t avoid another slump if spending drops off again. Companies won’t bring back more workers if the demand isn’t there, and fewer people returning to their jobs would eventually depress sales again.

That’s where the government comes in. Washington’s effort to help families out with bonus checks and more generous unemployment benefits has played a key role in restarting the economy. If the federal government pulls back too soon, however, it could endanger a fragile recovery.

“We are still at the beginning,” Lee said. “We are at the start line.”"
216,False,This article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions President Trump, former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D’Souza, Martha Stewart, Blagojevich, Kim Kardashian West, Sylvester Stallone, Alice Marie Johnson, Jack Johnson, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama as actors involved in the pardoning process.",True,The article discusses President Trump's actions of pardoning individuals and his decision-making process.,False,There is no mention of threats in the article.,False,There is no mention of patterns in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"President Trump began by pardoning former Sheriff Joe Arpaio for criminal contempt of court, after Arpaio refused to stop police practices that amounted to racial profiling. Trump mentioned his intentions at a political rally before granting the pardon three days later. Since then, Trump hasn’t looked back. Along the way, he has favored a host of well-connected, famous, wealthy, or partisan figures for presidential mercy. To his credit, Trump has not hidden from the press, Congress, or other institutions when exercising clemency. He makes a decision and then takes the heat, often noting that his clemency grants counteract an “unfair” criminal-justice system.

Almost a year after Arpaio, Trump teased on Twitter a pardon for the conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, who had violated campaign-finance laws. He pardoned D’Souza that same day, and then made comments that shifted clemency speculation to the TV personality Martha Stewart and to Blagojevich.

Trump has also been swayed by celebrities. He commuted Alice Marie Johnson’s prison sentence after Kim Kardashian West visited the White House to advocate for her. He also pardoned the late African American boxer Jack Johnson in a grant pushed by the Rocky actor Sylvester Stallone.

The usual procedure for petitioning for a pardon or sentence commutation is far less showy than Trump’s current process. Typically, after waiting a minimum of five years, applicants go to the website of the pardon attorney; download, complete, and submit the appropriate form; and wait. After a lengthy review—sometimes years—the result is usually the same for everyone: a denial. George W. Bush granted only about 2 percent of petitions for a pardon or sentence commutation; Barack Obama granted 5.3 percent; and—as of February 7, 2020—Trump had granted less than 0.5 percent of clemency requests.

The former pardon attorney Margaret Love explains in her article “The Twilight of the Pardon Power” that one crucial reason so few clemency cases receive a positive recommendation is that “all but a handful of the individuals officially responsible for approving Justice Department clemency recommendations since 1983 have been former federal prosecutors.” In other words, because prosecutors in the pardon attorney’s office are reluctant to undo the work of their fellow prosecutors, presidents are rarely given a thumbs-up to pardon.

The traditional role of the pardon attorney has been basically abandoned by the Trump administration, after the office assisted presidents for more than a century. As The Washington Post reported earlier this month, “Former White House officials describe a freewheeling atmosphere in which staff members have fielded suggestions from Trump friends while sometimes throwing in their own recommendations.” Moreover, “all but five of the 24 people who have received clemency from Trump had a line into the White House or currency with his political base.”"

The headline-grabbing move came as lawmakers from both parties were pointing fingers over the failure to pass legislation providing $1.1 billion to combat the mosquito-borne virus. That bill is stalled in the Senate, where Democrats on Tuesday again blocked it in a dispute over restrictions on Planned Parenthood.

“People are scared,” Rep. David Jolly, R-Fla., said Wednesday on the House floor. ""The politics of Zika are garbage right now.""

Jolly was holding a closed, clear container of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are the type that carry the Zika virus linked to birth defects. His office said they are still in the larvae stage but are expected to hatch on Wednesday.

He said the mosquitoes in the container are free of the virus, but taunted his fellow lawmakers about what they would do if they were released.

""Can you imagine, colleagues, the fear and anxiety in this chamber if these hundred mosquitoes were outside this jar not inside this jar?"" Jolly asked. ""Members of Congress would run down the hall to the physician's office to be tested, they would spray themselves before coming down here. This is the fear of Floridians, right here.""

The larvae were grown at the University of South Florida, where researchers are studying the virus and trying to help find an eventual vaccine.

On Tuesday, Senate Democrats for the third time blocked a Zika funding package and an accompanying Veterans Administration spending bill over restrictions on Planned Parenthood.

The vote renewed a political funding fight just hours after Congress returned from recess.

""It's hard to explain why -- despite their own calls for funding -- Senate Democrats decided to block a bill that could help keep pregnant women and babies safer from Zika,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a statement, “If anyone thinks the Zika virus is some political game, they should take it elsewhere. We now have nearly 17,000 Americans infected with Zika and we know that mosquitoes in the continental U.S. are carrying it, but too many in Washington don’t seem to care.”

But Democrats oppose the Zika measure as it bars Planned Parenthood clinics in Zika-suffering Puerto Rico from receiving new money to treat the disease and curb its spread. The legislation also would ease, over the objections of environmentalists, permitting requirements for pesticide spraying to kill the mosquitoes that can spread the virus.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans had ""loaded it up with poison pill riders to assuage the hard right.""

Shortly before Jolly brought a jar of larvae to the floor, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi nearly choked up speaking about babies born with Zika-tied microcephaly, calling the funding stalemate a “disgrace” and demanding anti-Zika efforts be funded for a year.

She, too, called for a clean bill with no “poison pills.”

The Zika threat hasn't gripped the public as Ebola did two years ago, but pressure is building as dozens of mosquito-transmitted Zika cases have been confirmed in the political battleground state of Florida since lawmakers left Washington in July.

Jolly, who is locked in a tough race in a redrawn congressional district against former Gov. Charlie Crist, said Floridians are angry. He said it is too bad that candidates are going to spend money on campaign commercials about Zika, instead of responding together to solve the public health crisis.

""That is why I am joined by these mosquitoes today,"" he said.

""Even if Saddam Hussein has 100 children other than Odai and Qusai, Saddam Hussein would offer them the same way,"" he said on the tape.

The two were killed in a gunfight with U.S. soldiers on July 22.

The speaker also called the deaths ""good news, that is the hope of every fighter for God's sake, as another group of noble souls of the martyrs have ascended to their creator.""

The message came as American troops appeared to be closing in on the elusive deposed Iraqi leader.

Soldiers overpowered and arrested a bodyguard who rarely left Saddam's side Tuesday and said they obtained documents and information that could help them find the one-time dictator.
• A new report on ending the war in Iraq by the Center for Strategic and International Studies warns: ""Unless this situation changes in Iraq, the U.S. may end up fighting a third Gulf War against the Iraqi people. If it does…this is a kind of asymmetric war that it is far from clear that the U.S. can win."" Tuesday's broadcast, monitored in Cairo, was the second tape attributed to Saddam in just over a week. The voice began the tape with a verse from the Quran and said those killed in the gunfight in the northern Iraqi town of Mosul would be martyrs in heaven. Like the tape played Tuesday, the previous audio recording attributed to Saddam contained a topical reference that suggested when it was recorded. That recording said he was speaking on July 14 and referred to the new Governing Council of Iraq. U.S. intelligence officials said the earlier recording was probably authentic and was further evidence that Saddam survived the war. However, the poor quality of the recording prevented technical analysts from being absolutely certain of its authenticity, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The bodyguard nabbed Tuesday, Adnan Abdullah Abid al-Musslit, was caught in a series of pre-dawn raids in the heart of the deposed dictator's hometown that nabbed a total of 12 people, including a leader of the Saddam Fedayeen militia. At around 4 a.m., soldiers fired three shotgun blasts into the locks of the house where bodyguard al-Musslit was living with his family. The stocky bodyguard struggled to break free as soldiers arrested him, and they had to wrestle him to the ground and drag him down the stairs, Lt. Col. Steve Russell said. It was the latest operation in a stepped-up hunt for Saddam, following raids over the weekend and last week's capture of several other bodyguards for the deposed leader. The 22nd Infantry said it came within 24 hours of catching Saddam's new security chief — and possibly the dictator himself — at a farm in eastern Tikrit on Sunday. It also assisted Task Force 20, the special operations force hunting Saddam, in a Thursday raid that netted up to 10 of the dictator's suspected bodyguards in al-Uja, the Tikrit suburb where Saddam was born. The search for Saddam turned bloody Sunday when a U.S. raid in Baghdad's upscale Mansour district left at least five Iraqis dead.

Their discovery, commonly known as the Ozone Hole, became a palpable example of mankind's ability to damage the Earth's atmosphere as well as one of the most famous success stories in the history of climate activism.

The ozone layer is a region of the Earth's stratosphere containing high levels of trioxygen, which effectively blocks much of the sun's most harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the planet's surface. Since the 1970's, scientists had pushed for the regulation of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals found in everyday items like air conditioners and aerosol sprays, due to their adverse effects on this layer. The Environmental Protection Agency banned the production of CFCs in 1978. It was the Nature paper by Joe Farman, Brian Gardiner and Jonathan Shanklin, however, which specifically revealed annual depletion of ozone in a spot above the Arctic.

The international community was uncharacteristically quick to act, perhaps because the seemingly sudden appearance of a ""hole"" in the atmosphere made for such a compelling and easily understandable story. Within two years, in direct response to the Nature article and corroborating studies, 46 nations signed the Montreal Protocol, pledging to phase out substances known to cause ozone depletion. All 197 members of the United Nations would eventually ratify the treaty, and as a result scientists now predict that the ozone layer will return to its pre-1980 levels before the end of the 21st century. The relative speed and unanimous adoption of the treaty around the world led former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to call the Montreal Protocol ""perhaps the single most successful international agreement to date."""

Trump Staffers Test Positive for Coronavirus Before Tulsa Rally, Protester in 'I Can't Breathe' Shirt Arrested

People wait to attend a rally with President Donald Trump this evening at the BOK Center on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

President Donald Trump's in-person return to the campaign trail is proving to be concerning, hours before he's set to address supporters.

On Saturday, Trump, 74, is scheduled to speak at a rally stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at 7 p.m. local time, for a controversial appearance that was pushed back ""out of respect"" for the Juneteenth holiday.

Despite the nationwide uproar over racial injustices, the campaign event is proving to be problematic given the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Held at the Bank of Oklahoma Center, which seats 19,000 guests, the indoor event could potentially expose attendees to the virus — a fact the Trump campaign recognized when it forced ticket-buyers to sign a waiver preventing them from suing if they test positive for COVID-19 afterward.

Crowds flocked outside the BOK Center early in the morning, with one peaceful protester being arrested by police while wearing an ""I Can't Breathe"" T-shirt, referencing the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis last month.

MSNBC reporters captured the moment on camera, showing the woman, identified as Tulsa resident Sheila Buck, being taken into custody despite having a ticket for the event. The Tulsa Police Department later said on Facebook that they ""were requested by Trump Campaign Staff to remove an individual from the secure area of the rally.""

""Ms. Buck was in an area that is considered a private event area and the event organizer, in this case the Trump Campaign, can have people removed at their discretion,"" the department said on Facebook.

When the woman appeared to refuse compliance, officers put the woman in handcuffs and escorted her away. According to police, Buck was booked for ""obstruction.""

""For clarification, the arrestee had passed through the metal detector area to the most secure area of the event accessible only to ticket holders. Whether she had a ticket or not for the event is not a contributing factor for the Tulsa Police in making the arrest,"" read the statement. ""Officers at the location, particularly in the 'Sterile' area, will remove individuals only at the direction of Campaign Staff.""

Earlier in the day, Tulsa police wrote on Twitter that there are ""hundreds of officers"" on duty in the city on Saturday, and that they expected it to be a ""long and eventful day.""

Exacerbating public health concerns, the Trump campaign announced that six staffers who helped set up Saturday's rally have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Associated Press. Tim Murtaugh, the campaign’s communications director, said ""quarantine procedures"" were followed, and the sick employees will not attend the event."

So when he recently predicted that China is hurtling toward a financial meltdown similar to the one the U.S. experienced in 2008, it predictably sent ripples through the global financial markets.

Yet, there is at least one analyst who believes Soros is exaggerating the risks.

Michael Hanson is an economist who covers the global and U.S. economies for Bank of America Merrill Lynch and he thinks comparing the U.S. to China in this context is misleading. In fact, he believes there are more differences than similarities between the two.

“That analogy is overwrought,” Hanson said in a recent report. “While there may be some parallels between the pre-crisis situation in the U.S. and China today, there arguably are even more important differences, including the nature of the increase in credit, extent of contagion risks to the broader economy, and scope for government policy to preclude or offset [a crisis].”

Soros last month said there is an “eerie resemblance” between the financial upheaval in China and the events leading up to the U.S. financial crisis of 2007-2008.

The octogenarian investor is famously known as the “man who broke the Bank of England” for his timely shorting of the British pound in 1992. He is also known to have made a similarly prescient bet against the Thailand baht, prompting some to accuse him of orchestrating the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997.

But Hanson’s argument centers on his belief that the Chinese housing bubble is a different animal than the one that overwhelmed the U.S. For one, mortgages are a small portion of total borrowing in China and households are not over-burdened with debt the way American families are. Furthermore, China is not relaxing lending standards as the U.S. had, which was the main trigger for the housing crisis, according to the analyst.

By his reckoning, Chinese household debt is 39% of GDP, versus 98% in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2008.

“Hence, we are unlikely to see the same sort of shock to consumer balance sheets and spending as was the case in the U.S. In addition, a correction in the Chinese real estate market is already underway,” said Hanson. “Widespread concerns of overbuilding notwithstanding, China does not appear to be subject to the same contagion channels as the housing crisis in the U.S.”

China also has another advantage that the U.S. did not—hindsight. Having seen how the U.S. crisis played out and the U.S. government’s response, Chinese officials are expected to intervene much earlier and much more decisively, he said.

If anything, Hanson thinks China is starting to resemble another economic powerhouse that has since lost its mojo — Japan.

“If we had to identify a historical antecedent for the current situation in China, a more applicable choice might be Japan during the 1990s,” he said.

Hanson argues that if non-performing loans are allowed to remain on banks’ balance sheets, it could lead to “sapping growth” rather than the type of financial crisis that the U.S. had witnessed nearly a decade ago.

Japan, whose economy was a role model for developing economies in the years following its post-WW II reconstruction, stumbled badly when its asset bubble burst in the late 1980s and it entered a so-called Lost Decade of stagnant growth.

Still, even as the economist dismissed Soros’ gloomy prediction, he believes China’s corporate sector bears watching with nonfinancial corporate debt at 166% of GDP in the third quarter. That compares with an average of 100% for emerging markets and 75% for developed countries.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank last week warned that a disturbing trend that was apparent in Thailand and Korea ahead of the Asian crisis is also emerging in China: the gap between the growth in M2— a broad measure of money supply—and expansion in credit.

What this suggests is that all the funds unleashed by the Chinese government are mostly staying in the financial sector rather than trickling down into the economy as intended.

Bank lending to non-bank financial institutions rose 68.3% year on year in the first quarter, while bank lending to government, corporate, and households grew 19.5%.

The low market rates on the back of loose monetary policy are prompting Chinese financial firms to use excess liquidity for investments to chase returns rather than lending. This in turn is leading to an asset bubble and a more fragile financial sector, warned Zhiwei Zhang, Deutsche Bank’s chief economist.

In response, the economist raised the probability of China’s growth falling below 6% for four consecutive quarters between 2017 to 2019 to 25% from 20%.

Beijing earlier this week said the country’s exports fell 1.8% year over year in April, significantly weaker than the double-digit growth forecast by economists. Imports also dropped by a bigger-than-expected 10.9% from a year earlier.

“Slower Chinese exports going forward mean that a source of demand will remain sluggish, which will create headwinds for China’s overall growth,” said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.

Weak imports will also mean subdued demand for foreign goods, weighing on growth in other countries, he said."

More industry consolidation and acquisitions may follow after JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) on Sunday said it was buying Bear Stearns BSC.N for $236 million, or $2 a share, a deep discount from the $30 price on Friday and record share price of about $172 last year.

“Last evening the Bear Stearns situation reached a crescendo, as JPMorgan agreed to acquire the wounded broker for a token amount of $2 per share,” CreditSights said. “The reality check is that there are many challenged major banks, brokers, thrifts, finance/mortgage companies, and only a handful of bona fide strong U.S. banks.”

CreditSights said it lowered its broker, bank and finance company recommendations to “market weight” due to the credit crisis and stresses in the market.

In the event of future consolidation, potential acquirers identified by CreditSights include JPMorganChase, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America (BAC.N), once it works through its recent agreement to acquire Countrywide Financial Corp, CFC.N the largest U.S. mortgage lender.

Possible foreign bank acquirers include HSBC, Barclays and Canadian firms, said CreditSights, which said the Bear Stearns deal should be good for bondholders.

“The debt side whether at the parent level or on the broker/dealer levels seems to be in rather good shape with the capital structure to be assumed by JPMorgan at deal close,” which is expected in about 90 days, CreditSights said.

Financial stocks are likely to trade lower but the overall market may begin to stabilize, according to Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. credit analyst.

“I view the stabilization of Bear Stearns coupled with the liquidity action by the Fed as constructive for the proper functioning of the lending system,” said Gregory Peters, chief U.S. credit analyst at Morgan Stanley. “Financial stocks will trade lower, but these are important steps in the path of trying to stabilize the credit markets.”

Global stocks fell sharply on Monday, and U.S financial stocks tumbled in early trading, led by a 86 percent slump in Bear Stearns. Lehman Brothers LEH.N shares sank more than 35 percent.

Financial share prices could fall further by as much as 50 percent, Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Meredith Whitney said.

“As we believe we will begin to see goodwill write downs during the first half of this year, we believe investors will focus more on tangible book value and stocks will quickly revalue to far lower levels,” Whitney wrote in a note to clients."

Next to the supposed sign of the crucifix is apparently a statue of a lamb.

This is apparently further proof that any aliens on Mars believe in Jesus Christ, as the lamb allegedly represents the lamb of God. The claim was made by prominent conspiracy theorist Scott C Waring who found the items in images from NASA's Curiosity Rover. The alien enthusiast says that these findings are evidence that not only was there once an intelligent species on Mars but that Jesus Christ travelled the cosmos enlightening planetary races. Mr Waring wrote on his blog ET Database: ""The cross is deeply carved into a black of stone.

""The stone clearly didn't belong here, but was placed here by someone. ""The stone is about six inches high. Right next to it is a statue of a sheep that has fallen on its side which is about eight inches long. ""The statue looks more worn and eroded, but it's clearly a sheep. I'm not a religious guy and didn't go out looking for this. ""I just came across the photo and found it. These small statues are further proof that a tiny alien race once existed on Mars.

""Now I believe in the Christian faith that the lamb is sometimes referred to as the lamb of god, or god being kind and caring. ""But it could also mean the followers of the faith, who often refer to themselves as sheep. ""What gets my goat, no pun intended, is that the cross didn't become a Christian symbol until Jesus died upon it 2,000 years ago on Earth. ""But if Jesus did the same on Mars too, then this is further proof that Jesus was an alien trying to instil morals and ethics onto not just humanity but other intelligent species too. DON'T MISS

""Now the plain cross is supposed to be a symbol of Jesus resurrection. Where a cross with him on it means the sacrifice Jesus made for humanity. ""This seems too much of a coincidence that two religious icons would be sitting so close to one another. This has to be actual religious evidence of an alien culture on Mars."" However, sceptics and NASA would say the statue and the supposed cross are just the effects of pareidolia – a psychological phenomenon when the brain tricks the eyes into seeing familiar objects or shapes in patterns or textures such as a rock surface."

Resumed and popularized by French technical magazine ‘Toute la Radio’ in January of the following year,[1][2][footnotes 2][3][footnotes 3] with the author mentioning Fernard Clerc as the coiner and speculating, although with technical background, on the theoretical chance of engaging in telekinesis, but particularly on the chance of operating microwave printed circuit boards by means of concentration, justifying it with the argument that ""brain currents are detected and measured at the micro-volts"".

In the late 1960s the term was popular among parapsychology researchers of the socialist bloc (particularly Zdeněk Rejdák, a prolific Czech scientist), and admittedly used to dub the term parapsychology to avoid its negative connotations, ""to advance parapsychology as a science"" (as stated in the Constitution of the Parapsychological Association in 1957) and because apparently, other than the desired scientific aptitude and status it lacked the concept of energy, which is found now in the desinence electronics. The term was then popularized in western world during the second half of the Cold War by science fiction and fears of mind control.

According to a 1983 text by parapsychology researcher Larissa Vilenskaya, ""the term was first proposed with the analogy of bionics in mind"", possibly referring to ‘Toute la Radio’'s article.[4]

Cruz -- a 47-year-old who battled President Donald Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination -- overcame major deficits in fundraising to ultimately defeat his charismatic rival, whose campaign electrified Democrats across the country and was backed by a galaxy of stars from Beyonce to Jim Carrey and LeBron James.

A win for O'Rourke, 46, a three-time congressman and former punk rocker whose given names are Robert Francis but who goes by Beto, would have amounted to a political earthquake in the reliably Republican ""Lone Star State,"" but he ultimately fell short.

Cruz's campaign meanwhile was given a late boost by his former rival Trump, who belatedly stumped for the Cuban American two weeks before the vote.

During the 2016 campaign, Trump infamously insulted the looks of Cruz's wife Heidi, vaguely suggested Cruz's father had played a role in John F. Kennedy's assassination and tagged him with the nickname ""Lyin' Ted"" -- an insult used by O'Rourke.

We live in an increasingly ideological and emotional society, with divisions deeper even than they did in the days of class warfare. Neither side on any of the great issues listens to the other any more, partly because there no longer is any respect or shared understanding. This is a catastrophe, and it is clouding many decision-makers’ judgment. Companies and investors risk making terrible errors if they are unable to break out of their own filter bubbles.

Trump’s opponents, as well as those who opposed Brexit in Britain, convinced themselves that their position was the only just, moral and economically rational one, and thus that a victory by their opponents would, by definition, stem immediate, cataclysmic disaster. They were wrong. Trump may end up being great for the economy (thanks to his tax cuts and regulatory shake-up) or disastrous (if his protectionism triggers a real trade war), but the markets and much of US business (bar a few high-profile targets) have moved behind him."

But last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation notified police agencies across the country to remain on high alert through the Games and for two weeks after they end.

Although security has always been a priority at the modern Olympics, the Utah Games were widely expected to be the most secure, even before Sept. 11. Mistakes at the Atlanta Games, in which federal, state and local agencies lacked a coordinated response to the bomb, ensured an expanded federal presence.

''All our security efforts here are based on lessons learned in Atlanta,'' said Cynthia D. Gillespie, chief federal lobbyist for the Salt Lake City Games who had the same job in Atlanta. ''After Sept. 11, they were ratcheted up. Not by much, but in those areas where we felt more needed to be done.''

After the Atlanta Games, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order that created a unified task force to deal with large high-profile domestic events, including the Olympics. The order gave the Secret Service responsibility for drawing up the overall plan, and it assigned the Army the task of coordinating the military role. The F.B.I. was instructed to devise a plan to respond to crises, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in charge of dealing with the consequences of incidents.

It is the first time that the protocol has been put in place. In addition to the air surveillance, these are the other steps to be taken:

*Secret Service agents will be used to secure all areas used for Olympic events. In the past, their role was confined to protecting the president and other dignitaries. The expanded presence represents the federal government's largest security investment, $27.2 million, according to the government report.

*For the first time in an Olympics in the United States -- this is the eighth since 1904 -- all law agencies, as well as military commanders, will operate as part of a unified Utah Olympic Public Safety Command.

*Airspace over northern Utah will be heavily guarded, with Awacs surveillance planes on routine missions, F-16's from nearby Hill Air Force Base on alert and added radar operating at Salt Lake City International Airport, where plans call for commercial traffic to be stopped at various times, including the opening and closing ceremonies."

Authorities revealed Tuesday two women who recently arrived from London to visit a dying relative tested positive for COVID-19, but only after being allowed to leave a mandatory 14-day quarantine early on compassionate grounds and drive across the country from Auckland to Wellington.

Prime Minister Ardern told reporters Wednesday she was appointing Air Commodore Digby Webb, the country’s assistant chief of defense, to oversee all quarantine and managed isolation facilities.

Health officials say they are contacting about 320 people the women may have come in contact with on their flight or the hotel they stayed at during their time in quarantine.

Ardern lifted the remaining social and economic restrictions just last Monday after declaring New Zealand had eliminated transmission of the coronavirus. Before the two women tested positive, the country had gone 24 days without any new confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The prime minister initially imposed a nationwide lockdown when the coronavirus outbreak first reached New Zealand’s shores in March, shutting down all economic activity except for essential services. She gradually began easing the restrictions in May, but has kept the country’s borders closed to international travel, with the exception of citizens returning home.

The policy change comes amid a debate over immunization for children, with some parents believing — despite overwhelming medical evidence to the contrary — vaccines against deadly diseases are dangerous.

The anti-vaccination movement has coincided with the resurgence of measles, a preventable disease, in some European countries as well as in U.S. states such as Colorado and California.

""It's essentially a 'no jab, no pay' policy from this government,"" Abbott told reporters in Sydney. ""It's a very important public health announcement. It's a very important measure to keep our children and our families as safe as possible.""

Under current Australian laws, parents who have conscientious objections about immunization can claim child care and welfare payments.

If the measures are passed, those parents would be denied the payments — which include child care rebates, benefits and family tax benefit supplements — reportedly missing out on up to $11,500 per child annually.

Parents unwilling to vaccinate the children on medical or religious grounds would still be allowed to tap into the benefits, although under tighter eligibility requirements.

Social Services Minister Scott Morrison said there were no mainstream religions that had registered vaccination objections with the government.

The new measures, supported by the Labor opposition, have to be passed by Parliament and would come into force at the start of 2016.

Australia has vaccination rates of over 90 percent for children ages 1 to 5 years.

But the government said more than 39,000 children under 7 were not vaccinated because of parental objections. That’s an increase of more than 24,000 children in the past decade.

Abbott said his government was ""extremely concerned"" about the risks such actions posed to the rest of the population.

""The choice made by families not to immunize their children is not supported by public policy or medical research, nor should such action be supported by taxpayers in the form of child care payments,"" Abbott said in a joint statement with Morrison.

Many people who do not vaccinate their children say they fear that a triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is responsible for increasing cases of autism — a theory repeatedly disproved by various studies.

The anti-vaxxer movement gained traction in 1998 with the publication of a now debunked and retracted paper published in The Lancet medical journal that linked the vaccine to autism."

Last night, Venus could be seen the brightest it’s been for eight years as a Wolf Moon lingered in the sky.

The combination of these celestial phenomenon and the fact that Friday the 13th is today has been enough to send believers into a panic.

Some religious theorists have cited a passage from the Bible to cement their claims.

Luke 21:25 reads: “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.”

This excerpt is loosely backed up by some of the natural occurrences that have taken place over the last two days.

The tides have been affected by the Wolf Moon and the second planet from the sun has been shining brighter than normal, causing the waves to “roar” and “signs in the sun”.

Concerned conspiracists took to Facebook to warn their friends about the impending doom.

One said: “Please we need to be ready at all times because we are practically close to the end of days.”

Another agreed: “Jesus is going to crack the sky and take His children home soon and very soon. The world is looking for a savior in all the wrong places.

“So much division and hatred, and wars of every kind. Not just wars between countries, but wars in the home, wars with the government, wars between generations, wars in the marriage, wars in the streets, war everywhere you see.”

Others believe that Donald Trump’s imminent inauguration will also have something to do with the apocalypse.

According to conspiracy theorists, Donald Trump‘s surprise election victory has coincided with people hearing a terrifying trumpet sound around the earth.

And there are fears that the ‘Trump Trumpet’ may be heralding the end of the world, after it was linked to a Biblical claim about the the “First Four Trumpets of Revelation” signifying the apocalypse."

MEMPHIS — Forty years of wandering the earth without Elvis hasn't diminished the religious fervor of his faithful fans.

This week, more Elvis fans than ever are expected to make their annual pilgrimage to commiserate and commemorate his Aug. 16, 1977, death.

They will go to Memphis and walk tenderly and mournfully with lit candles through Graceland's Meditation Garden where he was laid to rest.

They will go to Mississippi and sit and stand prayerfully inside the East Tupelo First Assembly of God where he first learned to love the Lord and play the guitar.

They will visit the sacred shotgun house where he was born, the iconic recording studio where he was born again, any shrine that bears his mark and memory.

Many will be moved. Some will weep. A few will simply fall down, as if slain by the spirit.

The wonder of Elvis Presley.

A pauper's son who became the King of Rock and Roll.

A dirt-poor Pentecostal kid whose love for Southern gospel music propelled him to secular fame, fortune and folly.

An evangelical entertainer of deep, abiding and conflicting faith who wore a cross and a Star of David, prayed and meditated, sang spirituals and read The Tao Te Ching.

""All I want is to know the truth, to know and experience God. I’m a searcher, that’s what I’m all about,"" Elvis told a friend late in life, according to Gary Tillery's The Seeker King.

Elvis was baptized, undoubtedly, as a child by a Trinitarian Pentecostal preacher in Tupelo, Miss.

He was re-baptized, reportedly, as a young teenager by a Oneness Pentecostal preacher in Memphis.

He also was baptized, posthumously, by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Multiple baptisms aren't uncommon here in the land of religious liberty, where beliefs and practices vary widely, even within various Christian denominations.

Elvis grew up in the heart of the Pentecostal South at East Tupelo First Assembly of God, where his parents met and his great-uncles were co-pastors.

The Assemblies of God, the world's largest Pentecostal body, follow the traditional triune formula found in Matthew 28:19: ""Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.""

As a child, Elvis was water baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, according to biographers.

When Elvis was 13, the Presleys moved to Memphis. They lived near the Church of Jesus Christ, led by Rex Dyson, a Oneness Pentecostal preacher.

Oneness Pentecostals reject the triune formula for baptism. Instead, they use Peter's instructions in Acts 2:38: ""Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.""

They baptize believers in the name of Jesus only.

""Vernon and Gladys heard me preach about baptism a few times, then they came to me and said they wanted to be baptized in the name of Jesus,"" Dyson told me in 2000, two years before he died. ""I baptized Elvis in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.""

There is no record of either baptism, but that isn't unusual, said Dr. James R. Goff of Appalachian State University. He has researched and written about Elvis' Pentecostal roots.

More: Elvis, Isaac, B.B. and Otis were card-carrying members of this venerable Memphis institution

""For most Pentecostals, baptism came after revivals and were not considered synonymous with the process of joining the church,"" said Goff.

For some, baptism also comes after death.

Latter-day Saints believe baptism is essential for eternal salvation. They believe everyone should get that chance, even those who were never baptized or were baptized without proper authority.

So they perform proxy baptisms on behalf of the dead. That includes Elvis, who reportedly was thinking of converting to Mormonism.

According to a 2006 documentary, Tears of a King, Elvis had been reading and making notes in the Book of Mormon, and talking to missionaries about converting a few months before his untimely death.

Apocryphal or not, the stories of Elvis' three baptisms only serve to enhance his immortality.

""With Elvis, there's a sense of promises unfulfilled,"" Goff said, ""given the degree to which he seemed to never quite find the happiness he sought.""

Not in this life, anyway.

Bush and a massive entourage came to London this week (November 18) for a rare state visit. Even before he arrived the trip provoked fury, with reports that US security officials wanted to create a three mile ‘exclusion zone’ around him, effectively shutting down central London and stopping legitimate protesters from getting anywhere near the President.

Angry at what he sees as using the “threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose”, Thom Yorke e-mailed NME last week, urging people to protest against the visit.

When asked why he’d chosen to speak out, Thom told NME: “To make Blair squirm over his decision to take us into a illegitimate war (In Iraq) and follow this religious lunatic (Bush) toward a dangerous future for the whole planet.

“Both of these men are liars. We have right to call them such, they are putting our children’s future in jeopardy. They are not controlling the terrorist threat, they are escalating it. Blair will not be allowed off the hook by his pathetic pleading for us to ‘move on’, neither shall Bush.”

Thom continued: “(The visit) will be heavily staged I think. I expect they will use the threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose, intimidate and arrest whoever they wish. The majority of British people were against this war, and Bush’s visit will just taint Blair even further.”

While in the UK Bush will be staying in Buckingham Palace. Yorke urged the Royal Family to “do something useful” and protest too. He continued: “This is a royal invitation isn’t it? How about one of the little heirs to throne doing something useful with their lives and speaking out? Refusing to shake hands for example? As we are still awaiting the results of the Hutton Inquiry I think now is a good time to remind Blair that he’s on very very very very very very very very thin ice.”

Anti-war protesters Damon Albarn and Robert ‘3-D’ Del Naja have also spoken out. 3-D told NME.COM: “The state visit of George Bush is an insult to the entire nation. The daily death and chaos in Iraq is escalating. This visit divides our people and our communities. The war on terror has only created more anger, more frustration and more militants. And the country continues to evolve into a future target for extremists.”

Albarn added: “We are still at war. We are still good at watching war. What does watching war tell us about ourselves? How does war lead to peace? How does watching war lead to peace? Two million people asked a question on February 15 – Why War? We haven’t had an answer yet.”

Travis singer Fran Healy also contacted NME.COM. He said: “Terrible timing from our government. WHY NOW? How insensitive is this? Nothing surprises me any more. The whole thing stinks. A three-mile bubble. Impressive. And the great thing is- we pay for it. We pay for all of it and we’ll keep paying in money and in lives for a long time to come. I wonder if Bush realises he’s the most unpopular man in the world. That is some feat. How does that feel? I am interested to see what happens. The police are gonna have their jobs cut out for them.”

Similar to the confidentiality protections between doctors and patients or lawyers and their clients, these protections are the primary differentiator that make Swiss bank accounts so popular with banking customers around the world.

Surprisingly, opening a Swiss bank account is not that much different from opening a standard bank account. You have to fill out forms and provide documentation that proves who you are and what you do. However, due to some special circumstances regarding privacy, the level of scrutiny over providing official documentation of your identity is more strict. For example, you may need to show your official passport to provide your identity, whereas a driver's license would probably suffice in the U.S. There are also different minimum balance requirements depending on the type of account you want. These can range from a few thousand dollars to millions of dollars.

Nonresidents of Switzerland must be at least 18 years old to open a Swiss bank account, and that's about the only restriction. Account holders can choose their currency—most choose to hold their funds in Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, Euro, or British Pound Sterling. There's usually no minimum balance required to open an account, but once an account holder deposits funds, there is typically a minimum balance requirement, which varies according to the bank.

Swiss anti-money-laundering laws require a prospective Swiss bank account holder to provide several types of documents in order to open an account. These include authenticated copies of your passport and documents explaining your profession, such as tax returns, company documents, professional licenses, etc.; proof of the source of your funds; and other typical personal information.

The main benefits of Swiss bank accounts include the low levels of financial risk and high levels of privacy they offer. The Swiss economy is one of the most stable in the world and has not been involved in any conflicts in hundreds of years. Furthermore, Swiss law requires that banks have high capital requirements and strong depositor protection, which practically ensures that any deposits will be safe from financial crisis and conflict.

Accounts held in Swiss Francs will earn a small amount of interest, but they'll also have to pay the Swiss withholding tax. For this reason, most foreign account holders have their Swiss bank account in another currency.

In terms of privacy, Swiss law prevents the bank from disclosing any information regarding an account (even its existence) without the depositor's permission. The only exception, the only way information will be revealed, is if a government agency makes the claim that a depositor is involved in a serious criminal act or is involved in some other financial issue (such as bankruptcies, divorces, and inheritances). Furthermore, Swiss anti-money-laundering regulations also require depositors to provide proof regarding the origin of the funds they are placing in their accounts."

And there's a fully-functional subterranean city underneath Washington, D.C., ready for the president and U.S. Congress to relocate to, should the Elders of Zion authorize their Beijing subsidiary to launch an ICBM first strike. If you believe that, or at least find any of it plausible, congratulations. You might be susceptible to being exploited for financial gain, which is exactly what they want you to think.

Conspiracy theories have probably been around for centuries, but it's only recently that the dissemination of the unverifiable has become an industry unto itself. While publicizing secrets to expose corruption and hypocrisy is a laudable goal, some conspiracy theorists don't seem all that concerned with the veracity of what they claim. If their fanciful theories and loaded questions can translate into money, all the better.

The most ""mainstream"" conspiracy theory peddler operating today doesn't necessarily fit the stereotype of broadcasting via shortwave radio from an underground bunker. Quite the contrary. He's a former governor and a speculative future presidential candidate. He also spent six years as an employee of the same federal government that he currently rails against - though granted, that time was spent in Vietnam with the U.S. Navy's Underwater Demolition Team, a predecessor of the SEALs.

That'd be Jesse Ventura. The erstwhile non-partisan former chief executive of Minnesota is the most recognizable face of an industry committed to setting the record straight about such calamities like the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 and 9/11, even though the record as it stands is as straight as it'll ever be. (Note: Muslim terrorists, and not the White House, were responsible for the World Trade Center attacks). Ventura has written seven books since entering (and then exiting) politics, and as time has progressed, the book titles have gotten more provocative and shocking. His first book, written while in office, is subtitled ""Reworking The Body Politic From The Bottom Up."" More recent titles include ""63 Documents The Government Doesn't Want You To Read"" and ""DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODicans.""

Does Ventura make money from his books that threaten to uncover the truth about, well, almost everything? Ventura would be financially successful even if he'd never written a word, enjoying lucrative careers as both a professional wrestler and wrestling commentator (not to mention a brief film career in the 1980s). While it's easy for any famous person who wants one to get a publishing deal, especially when that famous person has plenty to say, the politically unaligned Ventura showed his independent streak by signing with an unheralded publisher.

Ventura's books have sold in the thousands. At an average list price of $15, and assuming standard author royalties of 15% for such a relatively successful print run, and then assuming that Ventura gets $3 for every $2 that his less famous coauthor receives, that's still a ton of money. That goes relatively far in Ventura's adopted home of rural Baja California, Mexico, but it isn't enough money to change an already affluent man's life.

Ventura's auditory counterpart is Alex Jones, host of an eponymous radio show that purports to tell the unvarnished truth about everything from the concentration camps that President Obama might be preparing to hold us captive in to the hypocrisy of the Federal Reserve. Jones's show is broadcast on 60 stations, distributed by a network far smaller than industry titans such as CBS Radio and Premiere. Jones boasts almost 300,000 YouTube subscribers, but that's hardly a financial indicator. (Rush Limbaugh, the most successful terrestrial radio personality in the nation, has no YouTube subscribers.) However, rough estimates put Jones's net worth at a not unsubstantial $5 million, which is a lot of logo coffee mugs and t-shirts. Jones is a household name only in selected (and well-fortified) households, but his devotees are ardent in their fandom.

That being said, is exploiting the paranoia of the misinformed a path to riches? Signs point to ""No."" For every brilliant self-promoter such as Ventura or Jones, there are dozens if not hundreds of others whose oddball theories about the New World Order and the Kennedy Assassination not only don't stand up to scrutiny but can't be monetized. Concocting alternate realities seldom translates into wealth, a few notable exceptions notwithstanding. But tell that to the independent blogger who's convinced that the media-industrial complex is silencing his airtight explanation of how aliens brought the AIDS virus to Earth. To generalize, the same minds that consider fluoridated water to be a Communist plot are going to be similarly gullible regarding the success of for-profit endeavors.

It's fun and flattering to assume that you're privy to knowledge that the general population is not. And of course, it's not exactly news that politicians and their mouthpieces lie to us at least as often as they tell the truth. But if being among the few enlightened enough to know ""the truth"" is a path to making lots of money, the conspiracy theorists are hiding their riches convincingly. I guess it's still the consumer's responsibility to recognize these scams and stop them in their tracks if they want to avoid falling (and paying) for these deceiving lies themselves. Some are more obvious than others, however, and some are more entertaining than others, too."

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A witness to Saddam Hussein's execution in Baghdad said that celebrations broke out after the former dictator died, and that there was ""dancing around the body.""

""Saddam's body is in front of me,"" said an official in the prime minister's office when CNN telephoned. ""It's over.""

In the background, Shiite chanting could be heard. When asked about the chanting, the official said, ""These are employees of the prime minister's office and government chanting in celebration.""

Video showed Iraqis celebrating in the streets of Najaf, a Shiite holy city. (What jubilant Iraqis chant, bang drums )

The execution took place shortly after 6 a.m. Saturday (10 p.m. Friday ET), Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, told Iraqi television.

A power outage delayed the spread of the news to Iraqi citizens. But as word got out, gunfire could be heard in the capital's streets -- but it was unclear whether the shooting was celebratory or not.

Temperatures hovered around freezing hours after the hanging at the start of a Muslim holiday, relatively few Iraqis were on the streets of Baghdad.

Feisal Istrabadi, Iraq's U.N. ambassador, told CNN the execution was ""a very solemn moment for me.""

""I can understand why some of my compatriots may be cheering. I have friends whose particular people I can think of who have lost 10, 15, 20 members of their family, more,"" Istrabadi said.

""But for me, it's a moment really of remembrance of the victims of Saddam Hussein.""

Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki did not attend the execution, according to an adviser to the prime minister interviewed on state television. Al-Maliki is a member of Iraq's Shiite majority, which was oppressed during Hussein's reign.

""Let us turn over this dark page of Iraqi history and let us look forward to building Iraq together,"" al-Maliki said after the execution.

The nation has been plagued by violence since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Hussein in 2003, and sectarian bloodshed escalated this year after the February bombing of a Shiite shrine in Samarra.

The Baath Party, the political movement that ruled Iraq during the Hussein era, warned this week that there would be ""grave consequences"" if Hussein were executed.

Saying it would hold the United States responsible, a message appeared on albasrah.net Tuesday that read: ""The Baath and the resistance are determined to retaliate in all ways and all places that hurt America and its interests if it commits this crime.""

The largely Sunni-Arab Baathists said they also would retaliate against members of the Iraqi High Tribunal. (Baath warning)

Rubaie said the execution was videotaped and photographed extensively from the time Hussein was transferred from U.S. to Iraqi custody until he was dead. State television reported that those images will be distributed to the media.

""This dark page has been turned over,"" Rubaie said. ""Saddam is gone. Today Iraq is an Iraq for all the Iraqis, and all the Iraqis are looking forward. ... The [Hussein] era has gone forever.""

""He was a broken man,"" he said. ""He was afraid. You could see fear in his face.""

Vali Nasr of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations told CNN that Hussein's death marked ""the end of an era.""

Nasr and another Iraq expert, John Alterman of the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the big question now is: ""How do you put Iraq back together?""

Nasr said Hussein's death threatens to deepen the divide between Shiites and Sunnis because Hussein represents the last time the minority Sunnis held power in Iraq.

Nasr cited speculation that some Kurds are disappointed Hussein would not stand trial for crimes against them.

In Crawford, Texas, President Bush welcomed the news of the execution.

""Bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will not end the violence in Iraq, but it is an important milestone on Iraq's course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain, and defend itself,"" he said. (More world reaction)

Despite repeated attempts from health authorities to dispel false narratives that seek to undermine the science behind vaccines, Mr Kennedy Jr is one of a number of notable anti-vaccine activists. He wrote a book in 2014 about a mercury compound which has been used in a limited number of vaccines and claiming a link to brain disorders. There is no scientific evidence of a link between the compound, thimerosal, and autism.

Former Maryland lieutenant governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, former US Representative Joseph P Kennedy II and Maeve Kennedy McKean have said that they can no longer stand by and allow him to air such views, particularly in the wake of a measles outbreak that has struck 22 states across the US. They called the views “wrong”.

“Robert F Kennedy Jr — Joe and Kathleen’s brother and Maeve’s uncle — is part of this campaign to attack the institutions committed to reducing the tragedy of preventable infectious diseases,” the three wrote in an opinion piece for Politco.

According to the latest figures from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) there have been 764 cases of measles reported since 1 January, including communities in New York state and elsewhere where anti-vaccine views have influence.

“These tragic numbers are caused by the growing fear and mistrust of vaccines — amplified by internet doomsayers,” the three family members wrote, adding that Mr Kennedy Jr – the son of presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy – “helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines.”

Bringing up Mr Kennedy Jr’s uncle, President John F Kennedy, the op-ed states that the Kennedy family has a proud tradition of public health advocacy – it adds: “President Kennedy signed the Vaccination Assistance Act in 1962 to, in the words of a CDC report, ‘achieve as quickly as possible the protection of the population, especially of all preschool children ... through intensive immunisation activity.’”

In the days before Donald Trump moved into the White House January 2017, Mr Kennedy Jr told reporters that the president was planning a vaccine safety review panel, and had been asked to head up the review. Mr Trump’s team later said that the president had been merely looking into the possibility of setting up such a group.

Mr Trump himself has a history of linking autism to vaccines – despite the lack of evidence – tweeting in 2014: “Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!” He also mentioned the same issue in a presidential debate.

However, given the significance of what is the first large-scale outbreak of measles in decades, Mr Trump said last month that children “have to get their shots” adding that “vaccinations are so important.”"

A rise in cases of COVID-19, however, dulled near-term prospects for energy demand, keeping a lid on price gains.

In the U.S., infections of the virus increased over the weekend, while places outside of the U.S. also saw cases climb. South Korea on Monday declared itself in the midst of “second wave,” Germany also saw its rate of infection rise as the World Health Organization reported a record increase in global cases on Sunday.

Experts still were suggesting that crude, after taking a beating in March and April, and even falling into negative territory, may be primed to show improved uptake as economies see some signs of recovery from the pandemic, even if infections have been rising.

“Global oil market fundamentals have shifted significantly since we last adjusted out oil prices forecast on March 8. Given the improved outlook, we lift our 2020 Brent price forecast to $43.70/bbl from $37 prior in 2020. We also increase our 2020 average WTI crude oil price forecast from $32 to $39.70/bbl,” wrote BofA Global Research in a report dated June 19.

“Thus we also increase our 2021 Brent crude oil price forecast to $50/bbl, or $7/bbl above the forward, and our 2022 forecast to $55 from $50/bbl,” the strategists wrote.

Oil prices improved recently as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, in a group known as OPEC+, agreed to extend a global cut of 9.7 million barrels a day to the end of July.

“Our more constructive crude oil view reflects renewed confidence (1) in the ongoing global oil demand recovery, (2) in the damage to supply created by deep capex curtailments across the oil industry, and (3) in the solid OPEC+ agreement to curb output,” BofA wrote.

West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CL.1, US:CLN20, the U.S. benchmark, added 71 cents, or 1.8%, to settle at $40.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after putting in a gain of 9.6% last week. The July contract, which expired at the end of the session, logged its highest finish since March 6, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The new front month August WTI contract CLQ20, settled at $40.73, up 90 cents, or 2.3%.

Global benchmark Brent oil for August delivery BRNQ20, rose 89 cents, or 2.1%, at $43.08 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, following a weekly advance of 8.9%. It also ended Monday at the highest since March 6.

It’s unclear, however, if OPEC and allies like Russia are willing to extend production cuts into August. OPEC+ said it would review its output reductions monthly, with the next technical committee meeting set for mid-July.

Russia sees between $40 and $50 to the barrel as a fair and balanced oil price, Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said, Reuters reported.

“Moving forward, demand continues to offer plenty of uncertainty, with some regions still seeing a concerning rise of COVID-19 cases,” said Robbie Fraser, senior commodity analyst at Schneider Electric. “That could undermine consumer confidence, and ultimately challenge some of the demand gains that have supported the crude market over the past two months.”

With that in mind, demand figures in this week’s Energy Information Administration report, due Wednesday, “should again be in focus, while production is likely to rebound in the near-term, despite indications of continued declines longer-term,” he said in a daily note.

On Nymex, prices for petroleum products settled higher, with July gasoline US:RBN20 up 1.6% at $1.2913 a gallon and July heating oil US:RBN20 up 0.6% at $1.2186 a gallon.

July natural gas US:NGN20 settled at $1.664 per million British thermal units, down 0.3%.

This suggests an intention to mislead and cover up information.,"It’s been estimated that China’s government has detained as many as a million members of the country’s Muslim population in so-called “re-education camps,” in part of a campaign that has alarmed human rights activists across the world.

This week, drawing on 403 pages of leaked government documents, The New York Times published new details of how the ongoing crackdown took shape under Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leadership in the Communist Party of China, how government workers who resisted the plan were sidelined, and what officials were instructed to tell young people whose families had been detained.

“They’re in a training school set up by the government to undergo collective systematic training, study and instruction,” the talking points read, adding, “You have nothing to worry about.”

The Chinese government’s campaign against those it says have been exposed to extremism is centered on an autonomous region, Xinjiang, where nearly half of the 25 million residents are a Muslim people called the Uighurs.

Earlier in November, a FRONTLINE documentary called In the Age of AI examined how, as part of its crackdown involving the Uighurs, China’s government has made Xinjiang a test project for forms of extreme digital surveillance.

Among those efforts, the film reported, is an artificial intelligence system that the government claims can predict individuals prone to “terrorism” and detect those in need of “reeducation” at scores of recently built camps.

“The kinds of behavior that’s now being monitored — you know, which language do you speak at home, whether you’re talking to your relatives in other countries, how often you pray — that information is now being Hoovered up and used to decide whether people should be subjected to political reeducation in these camps,” Sophie Richardson, China Director for Human Rights Watch, tells FRONTLINE in the below excerpt from the documentary:

Surveillance and artificial intelligence technologies are being deployed all throughout China. Cameras with AI-powered facial recognition are everywhere, and various pilot projects use AI to give people a “social credit” score, punishing some for certain behavior and rewarding others for what the government considers good citizenship.

But the ends to which this technology is being used on the Uighur population, activists in the film say, are particularly alarming.

“They have bar codes in somebody’s home doors to identify what kind of citizen that he is,” lawyer and a prominent Uighur activist Nury Turkel says, warning that China’s government is using new technologies to help carry out mass punishment of an ethnic group.

Though China’s government says conditions inside its “re-education camps” are very good, as the film says, there have been reports of torture and deaths inside them.

The documents published in part by The New York Times this week were leaked, the Times said, by “a member of the Chinese political establishment” who hoped to help hold party leadership accountable for detaining Muslim citizens en masse.

Following the publication of the Times’ story, a Chinese government spokesman defended what he called “a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures” that he said had been successful in preventing violent terror attacks in Xinjiang. The Xinjiang regional government responded more forcefully, describing the Times reporting as “total nonsense and a pack of lies.” Chinese officials have not disputed the authenticity of the leaked documents.

For more on how the Chinese government is deploying AI tools on its people — including the Uighers — watch In the Age of AI in full."

U.S. Attorney General William Barr said former President Barack Obama and presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden are not under investigation after President Donald Trump repeated baseless complaints about his political rivals.

On Monday, Barr addressed the issue during an unrelated press conference, shooting down the idea that the Department of Justice is investigating the former president and vice president, USA Today reported.

“The criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends,” said Barr, who was appointed by Trump in late 2018.

Trump's history of lashing out at his presidential predecessor dates back to his popularizing of the debunked racist conspiracy theory that Obama wasn't born in America and has continued throughout his presidency. Most recently as the reality star-turned-politician has laid the blame for the country's coronavirus response on Obama, who handed over the Oval Office to Trump in January 2017.

Last week, Trump complained that Obama had committed ""biggest political crime in American history,"" but wouldn't elaborate on what he was talking about when reporters asked.

""You know what the crime is,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""The crime is very obvious to everybody, all you have to do is read the newspapers.”

Obama, like other U.S. presidents before him, has largely refrained from giving a public opinion on the Trump administration since leaving office in 2017 but has made a handful of veiled references in recent weeks to the Trump administration's criticized management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The former president appeared to criticize Trump during his 2020 virtual commencement speech over the weekend, which dominated the headlines about Obama's online message to graduating seniors.

""All those adults that you used to think were in charge and knew what they were doing? It turns out that they don’t have all the answers,"" Obama said. ""A lot of them aren’t even asking the right questions.""

Following Trump's repeated attacks and his son Eric's suggestion on Fox News this weekend that Democrats were ""milking"" the COVID-19 pandemic in order to damage his father's re-election hopes, the Biden campaign had questions of its own about the motives behind Trump and his allies' escalated attacks on the Obama-Biden camps this month.

“Trump's campaign knows he can't run on that dismal record, so they're desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of this crisis,” Biden campaign spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said in a statement, according to The Washington Post.

Defining Anonymous as a group may be a bit misleading, because there's no membership application, no initiation rituals and no certification or diploma that confirms someone as Anonymous. But there are some very real behaviors and customs within Anonymous.

Anonymous has spawned a whole set of mores and social norms and quirks of language, much of it documented in the Encyclopedia Dramatica. This online archive is a sort of like a 101 course to the ins and outs of the Anonymous culture. Fair warning if you choose to venture to this online destination: It is an unfiltered site with graphic language.

While there is no standard rule set, there are rules of the Internet listed at Encyclopedia Dramatica. Rules such as No. 12, which is, ""Anything can and will be used against you."" And No. 33, ""Lurk more, it's never enough."" Other rules are stark reminders that Anonymous is not always on righteous, idealistic crusades. Rule No. 6 is, ""Anonymous can be a horrible, senseless, uncaring monster."" Keep reading and you'll see more about what this beast looks like when it's on the prowl."

French authorities said that 597 people have died in hospital in one day, bringing the total of deaths in hospital to 7,091, while 3,237 have died in nursing home, with 820 new deaths in the last 24 hours.

The country started reporting deaths in nursing homes at the beginning of April, so the 820 new deaths announced on Tuesday are in part due to this delay.

Italy reported on Tuesday its lowest infection increase since March 13, with 3,039 new confirmed cases of coronavirus. The country's death toll has increased by 604 in one day, to a total of 17,127 deaths.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson remained in a stable condition in intensive care on Tuesday afternoon, receiving ""standard oxygen treatment"" for his COVID-19 symptoms, the UK's foreign secretary said.

The PM was taken to an intensive care unit on Monday after he was hospitalised due to persistent symptoms. He was diagnosed with coronavirus more than a week ago.

It comes as the UK announced a record 786 deaths from COVID-19 in 24 hours.

Elsewhere in Europe, Spain saw a rise in cases and deaths after recent falls.

New York hit a sombre milestone on Tuesday after 731 new fatalities from COVID-19, a record, took the city's death toll beyond 3,200 people.

That's two hundred more than died during the 9/11 attacks. September 11, 2001, saw 2,753 people killed in New York and 2,977 overall, after planes flew into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field.

New York is the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak, where hospitals are struggling to cope."

The Microsoft co-founder said that the number of fatalities - currently at about 20,000 worldwide - made the new virus “super-scary”.

Gates aired his take on the killer bug during an online Q&A with TED Talks presenter Chris Anderson.

Asked when he first feared the Covid-19 outbreak could become a pandemic, the businessman said that he became concerned at revelations of human-to-human transmission in China back in January.

“The alarm bells were ringing that this fits the very scary pattern that it will be very difficult to contain,” he added.

Gates said there should have been more action taken in January, including boosted testing of suspected cases, and vaccines.

The testing ""has to be prioritised, that is super, super urgent,"" he added.

When it comes to mass self-isolation - ""what’s clear is that the sooner "" it's done ""in a tough way, the sooner you can undo it and go back to normal"".

The men also discussed Trump's pledge to have the US ""open for business very soon"".

Gates said: ""It’s very tough to say to people, 'Hey keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner.

""'We want you to keep spending because there’s some politician that thinks GDP growth is what counts'.

""It’s hard to tell people during an epidemic that they should go about things knowing their activity is spreading this disease.""

Gates said that the number of deaths so far puts the coronavirus in the ""super-scary range"".

Worldometer's latest stats show that more than 430,000 people have been infected with the bug.

During this week's interview, Gates was reminded that he had warned of such a pandemic five years ago.

Anderson recalled him giving a ""chilling warning"" on TED, adding: ""The hair stands up on the back of the neck - it's exactly what we're living through.""

Gates said ""people haven't listened to that warning"" despite the impact of diseases such as Ebola, zika, SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

""In a world where people can move around so much, you can get huge devastation"", but ""sadly, very little was done"".

In the areas of antivirals, antibiotics and simulations, ""we hardly did anything"".

Gates said, ""now here we have a respiratory virus that is sadly fulfilling some of the more negative predictions I made"".

Asked if it was the once-in-a-century pandemic people had been fearing, he replied, ""this is horrific, but most people who get the Covid disease are able to survive.

""The disruption we've seen to knock it down is unprecedented.

""It's going global - how many people end up dying, if we do the right thing, it won't be a gigantic number.""

Trump said he'd like to have the country opened up and raring to go by Easter, April 12.

But Gates suggested a shutdown of six to ten weeks.

At the White House on Tuesday, the president held out a prospect - based more on hope than science - that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month.

His remarks came as about 200 million Americans were under lockdowns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as total cases in America climbed to more than 43,000 and over 530 deaths.

Trump added that officials won't ""let the cure be worse than the problem.""

""Our country wasn't built to be shut down,"" Trump said at a Coronavirus Task Force Briefing.

The President assured that the US can both function as a country and the economy can recover as the nation works to curb coronavirus spread.

""We can do two things at once,"" he urged.

Millions of people in America have been put out of work as states across the nation have implemented stay-at-home-orders.

""This was a medical problem. We're not going to allow it to turn into a long term financial problem,"" Trump assured.

He is frustrated about the virus's march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the US economy.

Trump also told Fox News he was concerned there might be a rise in suicides as a result of the ongoing impact.

The leader said: ""You're going to lose a number of people to the flu, but you're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression.

""You're gonna lose people. You're gonna have suicides by the thousands.""

The US is now more than a week into an unprecedented 15-day effort to encourage all Americans to drastically scale back their public activities.

The guidelines, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are voluntary, but many state and local leaders have issued mandatory restrictions in line with, or even tighter than, those issued by the CDC.

The president said he may soon allow parts of the economy, in regions less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening.

His suggestion that the pandemic could ease and allow a return to normalcy in a mere few weeks is not supported by public health officials or many others in government.

On Tuesday, top defense and military leaders warned department personnel that the virus problems could extend for eight to 10 weeks or longer.

Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a Defense Department town hall meeting that the crisis could even extend into July.

Among the steps taken in Beijing were canceling dozens of domestic flights, requiring stricter social distancing efforts and making those entering some residential areas undergo temperature checks and registration.

There have been at least 137 new cases in Beijing since late last week linked to a wholesale food center.

Brazilian health officials reported Tuesday 34,918 new confirmed cases during a 24-hour period. The country now has more than 900,000 total cases, trailing only the United States.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the severity of the virus while urging businesses to reopen. His Chief of Staff Walter Braga Netto said Tuesday, “There is a crisis, we sympathize with bereaved families, but it is managed.”

“Brazil has 23% of all cases and 21% of all deaths in our region, and we are not seeing transmission slowing down,” Pan American Health Organization Director Carissa Etienne said in a briefing Tuesday. “That is, the cases in almost all countries in Latin America, and a few in the Caribbean, are rising”

Peru has also been hit hard by the coronavirus, reporting Tuesday its death toll had surpassed 7,000 people.

And in Honduras, President Juan Orlando Hernandez announced late Tuesday that he has been diagnosed with COVID-19.

The United States has more than 2.1 million confirmed cases and about 117,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University statistics.

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Wednesday she assigned a top military leader to oversee “all quarantine and managed isolation facilities” after two citizens who arrived from Britain to visit a sick relative were allowed to leave quarantine without being tested, and later tested positive.

The development came more than three weeks after the country’s previous positive test, and the prime minister said she could not allow New Zealand to squander the gains it has made in stopping the spread of the virus.

“This case represents an unacceptable failure of the system,” Ardern told reporters. “It should never have happened, and it cannot be repeated.""

As work continues in numerous labs around the world toward the creation of a coronavirus vaccine, the World Health Organization on Tuesday welcomed initial clinical results that showed the drug dexamethasone can help treat those who are critically ill with COVID-19.

A University of Oxford team gave the drug to more than 2,000 critically ill COVID-19 patients, and reported that among those who were so sick they needed a ventilator to breath the drug reduced deaths by 35 percent.

Patients who needed less help, only oxygen to help them breathe better, the drug reduced deaths by about 20 percent. The researchers reported no benefit from the drug for patients who were mildly sick.

Spain, which at 27,000 has the sixth most COVID-19 deaths in the world, will honor its victims with a state ceremony on July 16. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced the plan to lawmakers Wednesday, saying officials European Union and World Health Organization would attend."

“I do think it’s something that happens sooner rather than later,” the economist told MarketWatch during a Monday-afternoon interview.

His comments come as the financial expert has been warning for weeks of an epic downturn of the buck that could signal the end of the hegemony of the greenback as a reserve currency — an event that would ripple through global financial markets.

“In a COVID era everything unfolds at warp speed,” Roach told MarketWatch on Monday. He pointed to the contraction of the U.S. economy from an employment rate that was hovering around a 50-year low at around 3.5% near the start of 2020 to one that shows some 49 million people unemployed since the pandemic took hold in March. He also noted the rapid and unprecedented fiscal and monetary response that has ballooned the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to more than $7.2 trillion from $4 trillion at the start of the year as examples of the celerity at which the currency market could change.

Roach is calling for the dollar to soon decline 35% against its major rivals, citing increases in the nation’s deficit and dwindling savings.

“This massive shift to fiscal stimulus is going to blow out the national savings rates and the current-account deficit,” he told MarketWatch, reiterating comments he has previously made in interviews and in an op-ed that published by Bloomberg News on June 14.

Last week, the U.S. current-account deficit, a measure of the nation’s debt to other countries, slipped 0.1% in the first quarter, falling to $104.2 billion from a revised $104.3 billion in the 2019 fourth quarter. The current account reveals if a country is a net lender or debtor.

Roach said that his recent warnings about the dollar have garnered intense and emotional responses from readers and critics, because he believes that the U.S. is at a particularly sensitive time in history.

He said the racial upheaval — sparked by the death of George Floyd — the pandemic and the intensity of the presidential election have combined to elicit powerful responses from readers that he hasn’t gotten since his days writing financial commentary at Morgan Stanley.

He said during this time you’re going to get “hair-trigger responses” from people.

“We’re at a critical point in the political cycle and the dollar is a relative price, so you’re making a comparison to the United States and other countries and there are just really strong views against the analysts that” call into question U.S. dominance, he explained.

Asked if investors should be fearful of a downturn of the dollar, Roach said that this wouldn’t be the first time the dollar has slumped meaningfully, and that “fear is a question of context.”

Fear may be justified “if they are unprepared and not hedged and have not thought about what some of the options are take advantage,” he said, pointing to the euro as a possible alternative to dollars for currency buyers. In the past, he has said that China’s yuan USDCNY, CNHUSD, may be viewed as increasingly appealing to investors, but that view is contingent on China following through with structural reforms the country is undergoing from a manufacturing-heavy economy to one focused more on services.

One measure of the buck, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, , has been weakening over the past 30 days, down 2.9%, but is up slightly on the year, rising 0.7%, according to FactSet data.

The index measures the buck against a basket of six rival currencies, including the euro EURUSD, , the pound GBPUSD, and the yen USDJPY, .

A weaker dollar has implications for assets and the stock market, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, and S&P 500 index SPX, , with most debts denominated in dollars. In addition, a majority of cross-border financing and international trade are conducted in dollars.

Edward Hunter, who was also a CIA agent, warned Americans that post-revolutionary China was using insidious and heretofore unknown psychological techniques to force the Chinese into the Communist Party. He labelled these techniques with the term ‘brainwashing’, a derisive translation of the Chinese his-nao, which literally means ‘to cleanse the mind’. Hunter’s theories not only reached a receptive audience, but were also quickly verified by other experts, who described similar techniques in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union . Americans were alerted to the possibility that the Communists had ‘cracked the brain’s code’ and were capable not only of controlling but of changing the will of their fellow citizens. Psychologist Joost Meerloo, a Dutch émigré from Nazi-occupied Holland, warned in his 1956 book Rape of the Mind that brainwashing techniques, which he dubbed with the far more sinister appellation menticide, were being used on an unsuspecting American public:

It is now technically possible to bring the human mind into a condition of enslavement and submission ... the totalitarians [Meerloo’s euphemism for any Communist government] ... influence the mind so slowly and indirectly that we may not even realize what they have done to us.

The reaction of Americans was rather spectacular. Quite rapidly, a panic over the threat of brainwashing spread throughout the country. Americans had already been conditioned to fear nuclear war, but the imagined loss of cherished American autonomy and free will was even more terrifying. Brainwashing embodied cultural fears of losing control and Meerloo’s paradigm for menticide became America’s paradigm for anxiety."

This week, drawing on 403 pages of leaked government documents, The New York Times published new details of how the ongoing crackdown took shape under Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leadership in the Communist Party of China, how government workers who resisted the plan were sidelined, and what officials were instructed to tell young people whose families had been detained.

“They’re in a training school set up by the government to undergo collective systematic training, study and instruction,” the talking points read, adding, “You have nothing to worry about.”

The Chinese government’s campaign against those it says have been exposed to extremism is centered on an autonomous region, Xinjiang, where nearly half of the 25 million residents are a Muslim people called the Uighurs.

Earlier in November, a FRONTLINE documentary called In the Age of AI examined how, as part of its crackdown involving the Uighurs, China’s government has made Xinjiang a test project for forms of extreme digital surveillance.

Among those efforts, the film reported, is an artificial intelligence system that the government claims can predict individuals prone to “terrorism” and detect those in need of “reeducation” at scores of recently built camps.

“The kinds of behavior that’s now being monitored — you know, which language do you speak at home, whether you’re talking to your relatives in other countries, how often you pray — that information is now being Hoovered up and used to decide whether people should be subjected to political reeducation in these camps,” Sophie Richardson, China Director for Human Rights Watch, tells FRONTLINE in the below excerpt from the documentary:

Surveillance and artificial intelligence technologies are being deployed all throughout China. Cameras with AI-powered facial recognition are everywhere, and various pilot projects use AI to give people a “social credit” score, punishing some for certain behavior and rewarding others for what the government considers good citizenship.

But the ends to which this technology is being used on the Uighur population, activists in the film say, are particularly alarming.

“They have bar codes in somebody’s home doors to identify what kind of citizen that he is,” lawyer and a prominent Uighur activist Nury Turkel says, warning that China’s government is using new technologies to help carry out mass punishment of an ethnic group.

Though China’s government says conditions inside its “re-education camps” are very good, as the film says, there have been reports of torture and deaths inside them.

The documents published in part by The New York Times this week were leaked, the Times said, by “a member of the Chinese political establishment” who hoped to help hold party leadership accountable for detaining Muslim citizens en masse.

Following the publication of the Times’ story, a Chinese government spokesman defended what he called “a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures” that he said had been successful in preventing violent terror attacks in Xinjiang. The Xinjiang regional government responded more forcefully, describing the Times reporting as “total nonsense and a pack of lies.” Chinese officials have not disputed the authenticity of the leaked documents.

Like, every event, every forum.”

This is how anti-vaccine activists were described by a community outreach worker in Minneapolis, where the Somali-American population was systematically and incessantly warned against vaccines. Activists including Andrew Wakefield — who published a fraudulent paper in the late ’90s pushing the vaccine-autism myth – made multiple visits to the Minneapolis area to engage a community that was trying to find its place in society.

The campaign led to an increase in mistrust of vaccines, particularly measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, among Somali-American parents, as well as dangerously low vaccination rates — 41 percent among 24-to-35-month-olds, according to one estimate. You don’t have to be an epidemiologist like me to comprehend the consequences of such drastic drops in vaccination rates.

Minnesota is now experiencing its worst outbreak in 30 years. It’s centered among Somali-Americans.

But the consequences of all this extend far beyond measles infections and far beyond Minnesota.

Measles is not a trivial disease. The virus that causes measles is one of the most infectious human pathogens. Before the introduction of routine measles vaccination, an estimated 3 million to 4 million cases of measles occurred every year in the United States.

The measles virus depresses immunity among those who get infected — thus impairing the body’s ability to respond against other infections. In a recent groundbreaking paper in Science, Michael Mina — then a student at Emory University — confirmed that measles vaccination played a major role in decreasing deaths from other infectious causes.

Recognizing the importance of measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with other key stakeholders, undertook efforts to eliminate indigenous transmission of measles from the country. This effort was successful in eliminating endemic spread of measles in the US by the year 2000. Since then, measles outbreaks have been mainly associated with importation due to travel.

But the major public health success of measles elimination is under threat. The concern that localized outbreaks such as the one in Minnesota can morph into large, national-level epidemics is not far-fetched. Many high-income countries — such as Germany and France — have seen large national outbreaks in recent years. In fact, multiple countries in Europe are in the middle of large measles outbreaks right now.

My colleagues and I assessed the risk of large measles outbreaks in the US. In a paper published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, we reported that approximately 12.5 percent of US children and adolescents are susceptible to measles. Moreover, we found that even a modest drop in the vaccination rate could result in the breach of the “herd immunity threshold” — that could result in breakdown of community level protection against measles.

When such outbreaks happen, it is often minority groups that get blamed for bringing disease into the country. For example during the so-called Disneyland outbreak of 2014-2015, multiple politicians expressed unfounded concerns about illegal immigrants bringing measles into the US. Then there is the not so proud history of blaming infectious disease importation and spread on ethnic and sexual minorities.

It is in this context that many of us in public health, who also believe in civil and human rights, worry about the Minnesota Somali-American community being blamed for something bigger than the current outbreak — even though the community itself has been a victim of an onslaught of propaganda and misinformation disguised as empathy.

If there is a lesson in this unfolding tragedy, it is that public health authorities and practitioners need to work hard to build trust and resilience among minority communities targeted by vaccine skeptics. This resilience to misinformation is important for preventing and controlling outbreaks.

The story exploded last week when congressional IT staffer Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport outside Washington as he was about to fly to Pakistan. Awan, who was employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (D-Fla.), was charged with bank fraud and has pleaded not guilty. But the story only begins with alleged bank fraud.

Here are 10 shocking things we know right now about the scandal.

1. Awan was arrested after wiring $283,000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union to Pakistan. Officials charged him with defrauding the credit union of $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application.

2. Awan worked as an IT staffer for Wasserman Schultz, who is a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi – who left for Pakistan earlier this year with their children –was one of several Awan relatives who were on the payroll of Democrats as IT professionals in the House. Together, they were paid about $4 million in taxpayer funds since 2009.

3. Awan is a Pakistani-born U.S. citizen. He had access to emails and files of many Democrats in Congress. He even had the password to the iPad that Wasserman Schultz used for DNC business until she resigned from the DNC in July 2016.

4. In a public hearing in May, Wasserman Schultz actually badgered the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police about computer equipment scooped up in the investigation of Awan and his relatives. The Daily Caller reports that Wasserman Schultz told the chief: “I think you’re violating the rules” for keeping the computer equipment as part of the Awan investigation. She also told the chief to “expect there will be consequences” for “conduct[ing] your business that way.” Still, Wasserman Schultz kept Awan on her staff until he was arrested – even though his access to the congressional computer system was revoked in February.

5. As the news broke of Awan’s arrest, the law firm representing him – Gowen Rhoades Winograd & Silva – criticized his accusers. One statement from the law firm says: “The attacks on Mr. Awan and his family began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives. For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing “pizzagate” media but from sitting members of congress. Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter.”

6. Wasserman Schultz has been avoiding the media, but her office responded to questions from the media with a statement: “After details of the investigation were reviewed with us, my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling. Upon learning of his arrest, he was terminated.”

7. Though both Wasserman Schultz and Awan’s attorneys are trying to disparage those chasing this story as being guilty of “anti-Muslim bigotry,” the FBI actually seized smashed hard drives from Awan’s home. Also, investigators say Awan and others might have stolen computer equipment from members’ offices and might have done illegal things on the House IT network.

8. Awan also allegedly funneled sensitive congressional data offsite in what some are calling a massive cyber-security breach.

9. This investigation has been ongoing since last February; however, even before Capitol Police began their investigation of Imran Awan and his relatives – including his brothers Abid and Jamal and their wives – there were a lot of red flags that should have alerted Capitol Police. Jamal Awan, for example, had an annual salary of $157,000, or about three times what the average IT staff member was paid in the House, according to InsideGov. Meanwhile, Abid Awan had a salary of $161,000 and Imran Awan was being paid $165,000.

10. Recently Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who is member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, discussed the scandal on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Fox News. He asked: “Why were these people paid what they were paid – $4 million over a number of years?” He added that “in my office we spend about $1,500 a month for IT support (from contactors). But then they had access to the files of members of Congress who were serving on key committees.”

DeSantis also said: “Congress needs to know how this happened and what damage has been done. We have a responsibility to protect the House. The possibility that sensitive congressional information was compromised requires Congress to examine this matter.”"

Mr. Cernovich, 40, teased the possibility of pursuing a congressional campaign Thursday and subsequently highlighted his hypothetical platform in a series of tweets sent Friday to his over 400,000 Twitter followers.

“Running for Congress this year.....It’s looking like a real possibility,” Mr. Cernovich tweeted

“Running for Congress is utterly taxing emotionally and financially, [but] the right seat *might* be opening up, one where there’s a real shot. Running as PR stunt for media is stupid, I turn down 90% of media. Will only run if there’s a play to win,” he tweeted.

Mr. Cernovich currently resides in Laguna Niguel, California, a suburb in Orange County currently represented in Congress by Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, The Los Angeles Times reported. He told the newspaper in an interview Thursday that he wouldn’t challenge Mr.Rohrabacher “under any circumstances,” but that he’d weigh considering vying for the seat currently held about 100 miles northeast of his residence by Rep. Paul Cook, California Republican, The Times reported.

“Can I take on the Republican Party machine? Get real. No. Zero percent,” Mr. Cernovich told The Times. “But if there are 10 people running in the primary and the establishment is split among them, I’m competitive in a 10-way knife fight. Then we’re in the game.”

Mr. Cernovich tweeted that he would campaign on items ranging from student loan bankruptcy reform, to opening “a special inquiry into pedophilia in Hollywood.”

He previously propagated the so-called “Pizzagate” conspiracy that alleged unfounded connections between a D.C. pizzeria and a supposed pedophilia ring operating in its basement. The concept spread wildly upon being touted online by outlets including Infowars, a far-right website run by fellow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and culminated in a North Carolina man opening fire inside the restaurant while “self-investigating” the theory in December 2016.

Mr. Cernovich downplayed the extent of his involvement in Pizzagate when reached Friday by The Washington Times and emphasized instead the recent rash of allegations involving disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein and other entertainers recently accused of sexual misconduct.

“I posted to a hashtag a few times, it’s not a big deal to anyone outside the D.C. media echo chamber,” Mr Cernovich said in regard to Pizzagate. “And given what Weinstein has been up to, and given that the media covered this up for decades, people wonder what Hollywood is hiding, and why the media is protecting Hollywood.”

Nonetheless, Mr. Cernovich’s social media posts are certainly capable of getting his opinions heard far and wide. His Twitter account is one of roughly 1,200 followed by President Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and one of fewer than 900 followed by Sean Spicer, the president’s former press secretary."

These little guys might do the trick, as well:

For the exact opposite, however, keep reading for the latest downer from Charles Hugh Smith.

The man behind the OfTwoMinds.com, which was recognized by CNBC as one of the best alternative financial blogs on the internet, has been calling for the implosion of the U.S. empire for years now, and the coronavirus pandemic has him believing that time has finally come.

“We like to think we’re in charge and that technology conquers all,” he wrote in his latest post. “But history moves in cycles that are larger than any person, corporation, elite or (gasp) technology.”

Can you guess which part of the cycle he believes the U.S. finds itself in this chart?

“The slippery slope to collapse — decadence — is characterized by greed, corruption, irreconcilable internal political rifts, moral decay, frivolity, materialism,” Smith writes. “Hmm, sound familiar?”

The pandemic is merely “the final kick into the abyss,” he said, after the global financial crisis laid bare the fragile nature of an economy kept alive with artificial stimulus.

“Elites have done nothing but kick the can down the road for over a decade,” he wrote. “Nothing that’s broken has been fixed; all that’s been done is trillions in currency has been borrowed or printed to paper over the dissolution, decay and decline.”

Smith warned of a “terminal crisis” that begins in 2021, regardless of any progress made to bring an end to the pandemic and kickstart the ravaged global economy.

“A COVID-19 vaccine, or lack thereof, will have zero effect in terms of reversing these cycles,” he said. “Call it fate, call it karma, call it what you will, but the cycles have aligned and nothing can stop the unraveling of all that was foolishly presumed to be permanent.”

Two days later, he died unexpectedly at a different hospital and was subsequently cremated. Significantly, Rachel Becker reports for the Verge, crematorium workers remained unaware of the patient’s treatment history until staff from the Mayo Clinic learned of the untimely death and commissioned the Arizona Bureau of Radiation Control to sweep the facility.

The results of this inspection, newly described in a research letter published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, were intriguing: As HealthDay’s Dennis Thompson writes, officials wielding a Geiger counter detected radiation contamination on the crematorium’s oven, vacuum filter and bone crusher. The particle responsible for contamination—lutetium 177—matched the type used for the deceased’s radiation treatment.

“This wasn’t like the second-coming of Chernobyl or Fukushima,” Mayo Clinic radiation safety officer Kevin Nelson tells the Verge, “but it was higher than you would anticipate.”

According to Live Science’s Rafi Letzter, the analysis yielded a maximum Geiger-counter reading of 25,000 counts per minute. In other words, an individual working directly with contaminated equipment would be exposed to roughly 7.5 millirem per hour—enough to exceed established safety levels, but far below the amount needed to cause radiation poisoning.

It’s worth noting, however, that lutetium 177 wasn’t the only radioactive material uncovered by investigators. In fact, Ryan F. Mandelbaum explains for Gizmodo, traces of an entirely distinct particle—technetium-99m—turned up in a crematorium operator’s urine.

Although technetium-99m is regularly used for cardiac imaging and other nuclear medicine procedures, study co-author Nathan Yu, a member of the Mayo Clinic’s radiation oncology team, tells Mandelbaum the operator in question had never undergone a test requiring the radioactive isotope. Instead, it’s likely he or she was exposed to the material during another seemingly routine cremation.

As Susan Scutti observes for CNN, the United States currently lacks federal regulations regarding the cremation of patients treated with radiation. Laws further vary by state, HealthDay’s Thompson notes: Whereas Florida bans the cremation of such patients, Arizona does not.

Combined, the gap in knowledge regarding potential health risks faced by crematorium workers exposed to radiation and the absence of standardized national guidelines for postmortem management point toward a need for both further study and wide-ranging regulation. These next steps are especially crucial given the fact that the U.S.’ current cremation rate is higher than 50 percent, as Mandelbaum reports for Gizmodo.

For now, Nelson tells HealthDay, the key to avoiding radiation contamination is communication.

“If you know a patient at your hospital has a large body burden of radioactive material and they succumb to their disease while in the hospital,” he explains, “you owe it to the funeral home to tell them about that.""

Speaking with HealthDay, Paolo Boffetta, a researcher from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who was not involved in the study, concludes, ""I don't think this is an issue that may entail any risk of cancer or other radiation-induced illnesses.”

“Having said that,” Boffetta continues, “it's clear it's a possible source of exposure, and if someone is exposed regularly, every week or every few days, then it may become a source of concern. There is a need for a notification process to be put into place."""

His comments come amid a measles outbreak in the Saint John area, a whooping cough outbreak in the Fredericton area and a province-wide gonorrhea outbreak.

""Many parents have made a choice not to vaccinate their kids and I think whether it be in a daycare, in the school system, that this has to be something that we look at — that it can't be optional,"" Higgs told reporters Tuesday, shortly after public health announced a ninth confirmed case of measles.

The latest case of the highly contagious respiratory disease is linked to one of seven other previously confirmed cases at Kennebecasis Valley High School in Quispamsis.

Measles is transmitted through the air or by direct contact with an infected individual.

""In a public system where others are at risk, there are protective measures that are well-proven and we have to see that people use them.""

New Brunswick does have a policy requiring students to prove they are immunized against several diseases, including measles and whooping cough, before they enter the school system.

The aim of Policy 706 is to ""minimize the risk that an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease will occur"" and to make sure students are protected if such an outbreak happens.

Students can be granted exemptions for medical reasons with a form signed by a doctor, or for ""parental objection"" if the parent signs a form acknowledging their child can be excluded from daycare or school in the event of an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease.

The current vaccination rates among students are unclear because Education Minister Dominic Cardy recently discovered the policy hasn't been enforced ""for a very long time."" The seven school districts haven't been collecting the entry data, ""despite the fact that it's mandated,"" Cardy has said.

""At some point you look at the risk and you've got to make a decision,"" said Higgs. ""And that's where we are right now, I think, with the protection of the measles and that's maybe where we are with others who just say, 'I don't want to be vaccinated.'""

Neighbouring Maine, which is dealing with its first case of measles since 2017 and whooping cough outbreaks, plans to end non-medical vaccination opt-outs in September 2021.

Last week, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed into law, a bill that eliminates religious and philosophical exemptions.

Higgs said he doesn't know whether mandatory vaccinations could breach the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but he intends to look into the matter.

""We've always talked about health being a priority, so we have to weigh the pros and cons … how do we make it a priority and protect everyone?""

The government will consult with medical professionals about how to minimize the risks to students and staff, he said. ""And we need to follow some rules around that.""

Liberal Edmundston-Madawaska-Centre MLA Jean-Claude D'Amours described the measles outbreak as ""a crisis.""

He called on the premier Tuesday to call Health Minister Ted Flemming back from vacation.

""We are really walking on thin ice right now. We are facing a crisis,"" he told reporters.

Higgs said Flemming will be back on Thursday. In the meantime, the government is dealing with the outbreak, he said.

""I'm very comfortable right now that we have it in hand.""

Health officials have said they expect the number of cases to continue to climb.

""This is really serious,"" said D'Amours.

The province's chief medical officer, Dr. Jennifer Russell, said she's ""very concerned.""

""We are putting all of the resources we can into this issue,"" tracking down people who may have been exposed to a confirmed case and protecting those at risk, she said.

""Pretty much everybody"" in public health in the Saint John region is working on the outbreak and additional resources are being brought in from other regions as relief, said Russell.

""In this type of a setting, to sustain that kind of workload and that effort, you have to rotate people in.""

Measles symptoms, which usually begin within eight to 12 days after infection, may include fever, cough, runny nose, red or sore eyes, sleepiness, irritability and tiny white spots in the mouth.

Within three to seven days, the telltale red blotchy rash usually develops on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body.

Anyone who is exhibiting symptoms and decides to seek medical attention should call ahead before visiting their doctor's office, a clinic or emergency room so proper measures can be put into place to prevent the possible spread to others, officials have said.

Measles can be more severe in adults and infants. Complications can include ear infections, pneumonia, blindness and swelling of the brain, which can cause seizures, deafness, brain damage or death. If contracted during pregnancy, it can cause miscarriage, premature labour, and low birth weight.

Most people are protected from measles with two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.

The first confirmed case of measles in the region, announced on April 26, was an individual who had recently travelled to Europe and visited the Saint John Regional Hospital's emergency department before being diagnosed."

South Korea is undergoing a second wave of the coronavirus, the country's health authority has said.

""The first wave was from March to April as well as February to March,"" Jeong Eun-kyeong, head of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), said on Monday, according to Reuters.

""Then we see that the second wave which was triggered by the May holiday has been going on,"" he said, referring to the Children's Day national holiday on May 5.

Seventeen new cases were reported on Monday, following the discovery of 67 new cases on Saturday and 48 new cases on Sunday.

""We originally predicted that the second wave to emerge in fall or winter,"" Jeong said during the same speech, according to the Yonhap news agency.

""Our forecast turned out to be wrong. As long as people having close contact with others, we believe that infections will continue.""

Seoul, the capital, has seen the largest rise in cases.

The mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon, said on Monday that ""if Seoul gets penetrated [by the virus], the entire Republic of Korea gets penetrated,"" according to The Associated Press (AP).

The city's second wave can be attributed to people taking public transport again, he said, adding that scientists were predicting that South Korea could see 800 new cases a day if transmission isn't slowed.

Park said he may reimpose social-distancing measures in the city if the average number of new cases per day goes above 30 over the next three days, and if the city's hospitals go past 70% bed occupancy.

Jeong, the KCDC director, said on Monday that people can take off their masks during the hot weather, as long as they remain two meters from others.

After China, South Korea was one of the first countries to experience a major outbreak back in February.

But unlike China, the country never implemented large-scale lockdowns, relying instead on an impressive tracking and testing mission. South Korea quickly controlled its outbreak and was lauded around the world as a model for coronavirus control.

A spike in cases in late May prompted authorities to reimpose some restrictions, closing down museums and parks for a fortnight. It also forced hundreds of schools to delay or reverse reopening.

As of Monday, there have been 12,438 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Two hundred and eighty people have died."

The vessel, equipped with a presidential suite comprising Saddam’s private quarters, dining rooms and bedrooms, as well as 17 smaller guest rooms, 18 cabins for crew and a clinic, was put on the market for $30million. Rocket launchers, swimming pools, a theatre, a secret passage to a submarine and a helicopter landing pod also feature. It has been decorated in 'Arabesque' style, with mahogany carvings, gold tap fittings and brightly coloured carpets. But the Iraqi dictator never actually boarded the 82-metre (270 foot) ship, which will now be used by the pilots who guide shipping in and out of the port of Basra after the government failed to find a buyer.

Governments that have succeeded him have been struggling to find a use for the ship. Since Iraq got it back in 2010 following a court battle, it has been mostly moored in the main southern city in the country. It was put on the market for £30 million but the government never found a buyer, and for the past two years the Basrah Breeze has served the city’s university, hosting researchers on trips to study marine life. The ship’s captain Abdul-Zahra Abdul-Mahdi Saleh told Reuters: “The presidential yacht is in a very good condition. “Its two engines and generators are functioning. It only needs periodic maintenance.”

Authorities have now decided to moor it permanently as a hotel and recreation facility for the southern port’s pilots, many of whom live in cities miles away. Basrah Breeze was built by a Danish shipyard while Iraq was at war with Iran and was passed onto Saudi Arabia - then an ally of Saddam - to protect it from air strikes in Basra. The kingdom - which saw relations sour with Saddam after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 - then handed the vessel over to Jordan. The boat disappeared off the radar until Iraq tracked it down in the French resort of Nice, where it was seized and sent home.

While the Basrah Breeze survived the turmoil of Saddam’s decline when he was toppled in 2003 during the US-lewd invasion of Iraq and hanged three years later for crimes against humanity, its sister ship ‘al-Mansur’ - which he also never boarded - wasn’t so lucky. That vessel sank in the Shatt al-Arab waterway that passes through Basra after it was hit by US planes and then stripped bare in the chaotic aftermath. Ali Hussein, a port pilot who guided the yacht at the time, told Reuters: “I told the captain of the yacht, who was a brigadier, to get rid of the military uniforms of the crew, weapons and munitions and pose as civilian ship in case it is caught by the American warships.” In regards to the future of Basrah Breeze, the city’s museum has not given up hope of persuading the port to allow it to dock the vessel next to its exhibition halls in one of Saddam’s old palaces overlooking the Shatt al-Arab."

Bush, in a speech before a convention of the National Religious Broadcasters, vowed once again to disarm Saddam by force if necessary, expressing doubt that the leader would comply with U.N. resolutions to give up weapons of mass destruction.

""Saddam Hussein regards the Iraqi people as human shields, entirely expendable when their suffering serves his purposes,"" Bush said. ""America views the Iraqi people as human beings who have suffered long enough under this tyrant.""

Speaking to reporters later during a White House meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard, the president expressed his disappointment with France's role in blocking NATO protection for Turkey against possible action by Iraq.

""I don't understand that decision,"" Bush said. ""It affects the alliance in a negative way.""

In his speech in Tennessee, the president vowed to bring food, medicine, supplies ""and most importantly freedom"" to the Iraqi people if armed conflict breaks out. Bush spoke as if war was all but inevitable, saying that economic sanctions, limited military strikes and U.N. inspections have not convinced Saddam to disarm.

""Saddam Hussein has broken every promise to disarm,"" Bush said. ""He has shown complete contempt for the international community.""

As he and members of his administration have done in recent weeks, Bush drew a parallel between the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and Saddam, saying the Iraqi leader has helped terrorists in the past and would do so again.

""Saddam Hussein is a threat. He's a threat to the United States of America. He's a threat to some of our closest friends and allies. We don't accept this threat,"" Bush said, leaning into the podium for emphasis.

Most of the president's speech was devoted to outlining his faith-based agenda, details of which have previously been unveiled. His remarks, in which he talked about the power of faith, were greeted with rousing applause and cheers from the audience.

Bush said religious groups should be able to compete for federal dollars to provide social services and called on Congress to pass legislation that would encourage more charitable donations.

""I welcome faith to help solve the nation's deepest problems,"" Bush said."

They include the abilities to evaluate a company's fundamentals and to determine the direction of a stock's trend. But neither of these technical skills is as important as the trader's mindset.

Containing emotion, thinking quickly, and exercising discipline are components of what we might call trading psychology.

There are two main emotions to understand and keep under control: fear and greed.

Traders often have to think fast and make quick decisions, darting in and out of stocks on short notice. To accomplish this, they need a certain presence of mind. They also need the discipline to stick with their own trading plans and know when to book profits and losses. Emotions simply can't get in the way.

When traders get bad news about a certain stock or about the economy in general, they naturally get scared. They may overreact and feel compelled to liquidate their holdings and sit on the cash, refraining from taking any more risks. If they do, they may avoid certain losses but may also miss out on some gains.

Traders need to understand what fear is: a natural reaction to a perceived threat. In this case, it's a threat to their profit potential.

Quantifying the fear might help. Traders should consider just what they are afraid of, and why they are afraid of it. But that thinking should occur before the bad news, not in the middle of it.

By thinking it through ahead of time, traders will know how they perceive events instinctively and react to them, and can move past the emotional response. Of course, this is not easy, but it's necessary to the health of an investor's portfolio, not to mention the investor.

There's an old saying on Wall Street that ""pigs get slaughtered."" This refers to the habit greedy investors have of hanging on to a winning position too long to get every last tick upward in price. Sooner or later, the trend reverses and the greedy get caught.

Greed is not easy to overcome. It's often based on the instinct to do better, to get just a little more. A trader should learn to recognize this instinct and develop a trading plan based on rational thinking, not whims or instincts.

A trader needs to create rules and follow them when the psychological crunch comes. Set out guidelines based on your risk-reward tolerance for when to enter a trade and when to exit it. Set a profit target and put a stop loss in place to take emotion out of the process.

In addition, you might decide which specific events, such as a positive or negative earnings release, should trigger a decision to buy or sell a stock.

It's wise to set limits on the maximum amount you are willing to win or lose in a day. If you hit the profit target, take the money and run. If your losses hit a predetermined number, fold up your tent and go home.

Either way, you'll live to trade another day.

Traders need to become experts in the stocks and industries that interest them. Keep on top of the news, educate yourself and, iif possible, go to trading seminars and attend conferences.

Devote as much time as possible to the research process. That means studying charts, speaking with management, reading trade journals, and doing other background work such as macroeconomic analysis or industry analysis.

Knowledge can also help overcome fear.

It's important for traders to remain flexible and consider experimenting from time to time. For example, you might consider using options to mitigate risk. One of the best ways a trader can learn is by experimenting (within reason). The experience may also help reduce emotional influences.

But what are the current rules and why might the change be necessary?

The NHS recommends a number of vaccinations to protect your child from infections like measles, mumps, rubella, polio and tetanus.

Not only will immunisation help keep your child safe, it will stop them passing on infections to other children and allowing disease to spread.

Recent years have seen rates of people getting vaccinated fall across Europe, and the UK was recently stripped of its ""measles-free"" status by the World Health Organisation.

The reasons for the decline in uptake are unclear, but NHS England has warned that so-called ""vaccine deniers"" are gaining traction online and on social media.

In recent decades, some parents have become less willing to vaccinate their children because of false claims made by certain campaign groups claiming a link between vaccinations and genetic conditions like autism.

Measles is a particularly dangerous condition, and can lead to damage to the lungs and brain, but 2018 saw 82,500 cases reported across Europe, the highest number in a decade and three times the total for the previous year.

What are the current rules?

Parents in England are currently allowed to refuse to let their child get vaccinated, but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is ""looking very seriously"" at changing that.

Some experts have suggested that compulsory vaccination may be necessary to address falling rates, and Hancock has said that he has taken legal advice on how the government could go about it.

Over the last four years, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the MMR jab by their fifth birthday has fallen to 87.2 per cent.

Herd immunity - the level of immunisation at which a population is considered to be protected from a disease - is around 95 per cent.

Hancock said he did not want reach the point of imposing jabs, but that he would ""rule nothing out"".

""When the state provide service to people then it's a two-way street,"" he said.

""You have to take your responsibilities too.""

There are currently no plans to make vaccines compulsory in Wales.

What vaccinations do the NHS recommend?

The NHS recommends that babies under 12 months old receive the following vaccinations:
• 6-in-1 vaccine to immunise against diphtheria, hepatitis B, Hip (Haemophilus influenzae type b), polio, tetanus, and whooping cough.
• Pneumococcal vaccine to guard against bacteria that can lead to pneumonia, septicaemia, and meningitis.
• MenB vaccine to protect against infection by the bacteria group responsible for more than 90 per cent of meningococcal infections - which can lead to meningitis and sepsis - in young children.
• Rotavirus vaccine to guard against the rotavirus, a highly infectious stomach bug that typically causes vomiting, stomach ache, and fever in babies and young children.

A number of vaccinations are also recommended for children aged one to 15:
• 4-in-1 pre-school booster to boost defences against diphtheria, polio, tetanus, and whooping cough.
• 3-in-1 teenage booster to boost defences against diphtheria, polio, and tetanus.
• MMR jab, to immunise against measles, mumps, and rubella.
• The HPV vaccine, to provide protection from human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to cancers of the cervix, mouth, throat, and genitals.
• Children's flu vaccine, a yearly nasal spray to guard against flu, which can be much more serious for children than it is for adults.
• Hib/MenC vaccine, a single injection given to one-year-old babies to protect against the potentially-fatal Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and meningitis C viruses.
• MenACWY vaccine, recommended for teenagers and students going to university to guard against potentially-fatal meningitis and septicaemia."

* Court says mercury preservative did not cause autism

WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) - Vaccines that contain a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal cannot cause autism on their own, a special U.S. court ruled on Friday, dealing one more blow to parents seeking to blame vaccines for their children's illness.

The special U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that vaccines could not have caused the autism of an Oregon boy, William Mead, ending his family's quest for reimbursement.

""The Meads believe that thimerosal-containing vaccines caused William's regressive autism. As explained below, the undersigned finds that the Meads have not presented a scientifically sound theory,"" Special Master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in his ruling.

The Meads had filed a civil lawsuit in Oregon state court against a number of pharmaceutical companies alleging that the thimerosal additive in many pediatric vaccines significantly contributed to the development of William's autism, Hastings wrote.

While the state court determined the autism was vaccine-related, Hastings said overwhelming medical evidence showed otherwise. The theory presented by the Meads and experts who testified on their behalf ""was biologically implausible and scientifically unsupported"", Hasting wrote.

In February 2009, the court ruled against three families who claimed vaccines caused their children's autism, saying they had been ""misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment"".

The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines.

Instead of judges, three ""special masters"" heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners.

They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal, caused the children's symptoms.

More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine-making business.

Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 110 U.S. children. The so-called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger's Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine has reported several times that no link can be found between vaccines and autism.

In a separate matter, the U.S. Supreme Court said earlier this month it would decide whether a federal law protects vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits in state court seeking damages for alleged design defects.

The high court agreed to hear a Pennsylvania case involving a lawsuit by the parents of a child who suffered seizures after her third dose of a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine. They sued the vaccine manufacturer, Wyeth, which Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) purchased last year."

“As to President Obama and Vice President Biden, whatever their level of involvement, based on the information I have today, I don’t expect Mr. Durham’s work will lead to a criminal investigation of either man,” Barr said.

Federal prosecutor John Durham is reviewing the origins of the investigation of Russia’s 2016 election interference.

President Donald Trump in recent weeks has repeatedly referred to a scandal he calls “Obamagate,” saying without evidence that Obama was tied to “the biggest political crime in American history.”

Trump stepped up those claims as he faced criticism for the administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 88,000 Americans, and prepares to face Biden in the November election.

Barr added that the election should be decided strictly on policy debates, and that any investigation of a political candidate would need to be approved by him personally.

“We cannot allow this process to be hijacked by efforts to drum up criminal investigations of either candidate,” Barr said.

Barr did not rule out the possibility of others being criminally investigated, without offering specifics.

Trump has not made clear what he is accusing Obama of doing, but the allegations appear to focus on law enforcement actions taken at the end of Obama’s presidency.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded in March 2019 that Russians had actively tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, both through the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s email system and through propaganda.

While his report documented numerous contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia, he said there was not sufficient evidence to prove there was a criminal conspiracy.

Russia has repeatedly denied trying to influence the election and Trump has dismissed the idea as a hoax.

Barr has faced scathing criticism from Democrats and former career prosecutors in recent months who say he is the one who has politicized the justice system in favor of allies of Trump.

Earlier this month, Barr moved to dismiss the criminal charges against Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

In February he intervened to recommend a lighter sentence for Trump’s longtime friend Roger Stone."
273,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions a Satanic group as a possible actor behind the theft.,True,The article describes the theft of the reliquary and cross.,False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,False,There is no mention of a pattern in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"A religious reliquary containing blood from the late Pope John Paul II has been stolen from a remote mountain church in Italy, with speculation that a Satanic group could be behind the theft.

A team of around 50 Carabinieri police officers with sniffer dogs were on Monday searching for any trace of the reliquary, which was stolen from the Church of St Peter of Ienca in the Abruzzo mountains at the weekend.

The ornate gold object contains a fragment of material, stained with blood, which was purportedly taken from the clothing worn by John Paul II after he was shot during the failed attempt on his life in St Peter’s Square in 1981.

It was donated to the church in May 2011 by Stanislaw Dzuwisz, a Polish cardinal and the Pope’s former personal secretary.

The reliquary is one of just a handful in the world that contains the blood of the Polish pope, who died in 2005 and was succeeded by Benedict XVI.

It was stolen along with a cross from the church, which lies close to Gran Sasso, a 9,550ft- high mountain in the Apennines east of Rome.

The theft was discovered on Saturday by a priest from the religious sanctuary, which is dedicated to the memory of John Paul II.

The Pope was very fond of the region and used to spend holidays there, walking, meditating and skiing at the nearby resort of Campo Imperatore.

It is also famous as the place where Benito Mussolini was interned after Italy swapped sides during the war, and from where he was rescued by a team of German paratroopers in Sept 1943 during a daring airborne raid.

“It’s possible that there could be Satanic sects behind the theft of the reliquary,” said Giovanni Panunzio, the national coordinator of an anti-occult group called Osservatorio Antiplagio.

“This period of the year is important in the Satanic calendar and culminates in the Satanic ‘new year’ on Feb 1. This sort of sacrilege often take place at this time of the year. We hope that the stolen items are recovered as quickly as possible.”

The theft of the reliquary comes as the Vatican prepares to canonise John Paul II, along with another former Pope, John XXIII, at a ceremony on April 27.

At John Paul II’s funeral in 2005, crowds of mourners cried ""Santo Subito!"" - ""Sainthood now"" - prompting the Vatican to speed up the Polish pontiff’s path to canonisation.

In Aug 2012, another relic containing a vial of the late Pope’s blood was stolen from a Catholic priest while he was travelling on a train north of Rome.

The relic was in his backpack, which was swiped by thieves but later recovered in a thicket of cane grass by police."

It presents evidence and arguments from both sides, highlighting a pattern of debate and ongoing research.",False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public in the article.,"No public health issue of recent years has attracted such heated debate as the question of whether the MMR vaccine can cause autism. The MMR jab combines three childhood vaccines, against measles, mumps and rubella, into one injection, which is first given to children at around 12-18 months. It has virtually eradicated these diseases from the UK, and throughout the world it has saved hundreds of lives. Recent years, however, have seen the rates of MMR vaccination decline. In some areas of the UK, only 60% of children are receiving MMR. This decline has already let to a rise in the number of measles infections, and there are fears of an epidemic outbreak. The reason for all the concern over MMR is the suggestion that the vaccine might in fact be damaging some of the children it was supposed to protect. Rosemary Kessick's 16-year-old son William is severely autistic. Shortly after William had his MMR shot, Rosemary noticed a change in his behaviour. He also started suffering from recurring bowel problems. Convinced the three things were connected, she took William to the Royal Free Hospital in north London to see Dr Andrew Wakefield, a specialist in bowel diseases. Wakefield became convinced that William and a number of other children he had examined were suffering from a new kind of bowel disease that could be linked to their autism. What's more, he started to wonder whether this condition was being caused by the MMR vaccine. At the press conference to coincide with the publication of this research he suggested that the combined MMR jab should not be used. The result was a media storm. Ever since, scientists have been looking at the evidence to see whether there really is a link between autism and the vaccine. The medical community has relied mainly on epidemiology - the statistical study of large populations. These studies have overwhelmingly found no link between autism and MMR. Opponents claim that some of these studies might have flaws, but there are over a dozen epidemiological studies in different countries that use different techniques that have reached the same conclusion. At the very least, these studies show that the large increases in rates of autism that have been reported in many countries around the world cannot be due to MMR. However, the opponents of the vaccine point out that epidemiology can't rule out an increased risk to a small number of children - a vulnerable subset. They pointed to distinctive features of some of the autistic children that they said was evidence of a possible connection with MMR. Firstly, these children seemed to have a novel bowel disease that was unique to children with autism; and in 2002 Wakefield, working with virologist Prof John O'Leary, claimed to have found the measles virus inside tissue samples from autistic children. Since then, debate has raged over these claims. Little independent clinical research into these claims has been funded - to the anger of many parents. But now at last the deadlock is being broken. Timothy Buie is a paediatric gastroenterologist in Boston. What makes him unique is that he works in a clinic that specialises in the care of children with autism and related disorders. Like Dr Wakefield, he has found that many of these children do have real bowel problems that are worthy of investigation. But despite having performed colonoscopies on hundreds of children, both with and without autism, Dr Buie has so far seen nothing that convinces him the autistic children have a new or distinctive form of bowel disease. His research is still ongoing, but it casts doubt on one aspect of the Wakefield hypothesis. But perhaps the most crucial question is whether the measles virus really is persisting in the bodies of autistic children; and now that question too has been investigated. A new, unpublished study has examined blood samples from a group of 100 autistic children and 200 children without autism. These samples have been examined using the most sensitive methods available. They found 99% of the samples contained no trace of the measles virus, and the samples that did contain the virus were just as likely to be from non-autistic children. The study therefore found no evidence of any link between MMR and autism."

(RCL) is trading sharply higher on Tuesday morning, despite missing fourth quarter 2019 estimates and lowering first quarter 2020 guidance. The buy-the-news reaction follows a two-week 15% slide in reaction to Australian bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting that covering shorts are responsible for the majority of short-term gains. If so, the uptick could run into a fresh buzzsaw of selling pressure at any time.

Travel stocks have taken a major hit in recent weeks, with income streams battered by suspended flights to and from China, as well as continued delays in the re-certification of The Boeing Company's (BA) 737-MAX airliner. Investors are also avoiding the group because they're worried that headwinds will shrink worldwide GDP in the first quarter, possibly triggering a recessionary spiral. Uncertainty is a bigger negative than bearish headlines at this point because nobody knows how long this crisis will last or the final damage toll to lives and the economic outlook.

Royal Caribbean Cruises stock broke out above 10-year resistance in the mid-$50s in 2014, entering a strong uptrend that topped out above $130 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Breakout attempts in 2018 and 2019 failed, while a steep decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 dumped the stock to a two-year low in the upper $90s. Bullish price action reached range resistance for the fourth time in January 2020, once again triggering a major reversal.

The on-balance volume (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator surged to a new high in November 2019, predicting that price would soon play catch-up. However, January headlines have trapped this large supply of bulls in losing positions, which could generate downside rocket fuel if this morning's bounce fails in coming sessions. Until then, short sellers should step aside and allow this oversold bounce to play out.

United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) stock topped out in the mid-$70s in 2015 and entered a steep decline that found support near $40 in 2016. It returned to the prior high in 2017 and broke out, but momentum buyers failed to show up, yielding dead sideways action into a secondary breakout in 2018. This bullish impulse suffered the same fate, yielding another 17 months of range-bound trading, ahead of a January 2020 downdraft that has triggered a failed breakout.

The stock is now sitting at exactly the same price posted in January 2015, meaning that long-term shareholders have booked a 0% return in the past five years. Worse yet, the company pays no dividend, which would have acted as a ""consolation prize"" for the dead money invested in this equity during one of the strongest bull markets in history. And given last month's breakdown, downside risk now exposes an unpleasant trip into the 2017 low in the mid-$50s.

Expedia Group, Inc.'s (EXPE) troubles started well before the coronavirus outbreak, with airlines, hotels, and car rental agencies taking matters into their own hands, contesting the company's near monopoly on U.S. travel with more competitive website pricing and deals. Expedia stock topped out near $140 in 2015, entering a trading range ahead of a failed breakout in 2017. Buyers returned in 2018, but 2015 resistance rebuffed four rally attempts into October 2019.

The stock plummeted more than 30% in two weeks in November after Expedia missed quarterly estimates, and it has failed two attempts to enter the sell gap. The price turned lower once again after the virus outbreak hit the newswires and may be headed into a dreaded test of the fourth quarter low, which also marks a three-year low. Ominously, that level is just five points above the 2016 low, raising the odds for a multi-year triple top breakdown.

Travel stocks are trading sharply lower in reaction to the coronavirus outbreak and other emerging headwinds.

It marked a turning point in post-war Iraq. It was psychologically important for the Americans and had huge symbolism for the Iraqis, the paper said.

Saddam's clan had been able to retain its aura of brutality and power in spite of all the military victories scored by the allies. This was evident by the fear in the population that Saddam could one day return and punish those who helped the Americans. But now with the demise of the two sons, that fear would be less intense, Die Welt said. The Americans had finally and conclusively proven that the old guard could not hide from them.

The Frankfurter Rundschau was more sceptical in its stance. Had there really been a fundamental change to the political situation in Iraq? The occupying authorities seemed to think so, the paper said. They put continuing resistance down to attacks launched under direct or indirect command of the old regime, or down to the ""Sunni triangle"" of Saddam loyalists, which they believed to be a temporary phenomenon.

This, the daily said, was only part of the story. The opposition was more deep-rooted than that and was growing anew everyday, fostered by the failure to provide the population with water, electricity and jobs. The attacks on the occupying troops and those who worked for them in positions of trust were apparently being carried out by those who were more likely to fear the return of Saddam Hussein than to profit from it. If the fear that Saddam and his sons were going to return subsided, then so, too, did any inhibitions about resisting the occupying forces.

The Rhein Zeitung said many Iraqis would be breathing a sigh of relief at the death of the two sons. But the danger had not passed. Saddam Hussein would continue to inhabit the nightmares of Iraqis for as long as he was able to tape record seditious messages.

The Süddeutsche Zeitung commented on a planned exhibition in Berlin about the Red Army Faction, or RAF. The German guerrilla group was responsible for bombings and assassinations in the 1970s and 1980s. The RAF, for example, killed the employers' association leader Hans Martin Schleyer in 1977 and the director of the agency set up to privatize East Germany, Detlev Rohwedder, in 1991.

Now, the city of Berlin has earmarked €100,000 for an exhibition to be staged in 2004 about the RAF's history. However, after objections from victims' families, Chancellor Schröder has called for a review of the event to assess whether it should receive state funding. Süddeutsche Zeitung said accounts of the RAF had already been given a personal touch in various books and films, but they lacked analysis and reflection. Nobody today seemed to care about the laws that were passed back then in a bid to defeat the RAF, it said. And nobody seemed to worry why the authorities hadn't cleared up a single crime committed by the RAF since 1985. Years of public panic had been replaced by a curious sort of detached weariness, the daily wrote."

For example, let’s assume an investor purchases a $10,000 bond at par. The bond has a 10% coupon paid semiannually and matures in three years. If market yields stay at 10%, the following would occur at the end of the first two years:

As the table shows, the investor would receive $2,000 in coupon payments, which he would reinvest as he receives them at the market rate of 10% per year, earning him another $155. When the coupons and the interest on interest are added to the bond principal, the accumulated value of his investment is $12,155, for a 10% annual return.

Now consider what happens if market yields increase, say to 15%, right after the investor purchases the bond.

The higher reinvestment rate increased the amount of interest the investor earned on the coupon payments. However, the price of the bond fell more than enough to offset this gain. The net result was a decrease in total return. Now compare this to what would have happened if reinvestment rates fell to 8% instead.

In this example, the low reinvestment rate reduced the interest earned on the coupon payments. But the bond price rose, offsetting some of this loss. The net result was an increase in total return. Thus, the yin-yang relationship between interest rates and bond prices also creates a tradeoff between reinvestment risk and interest rate risk.

The trick to immunization therefore is to find bonds where the change in interest on interest exactly offsets the change in price when rates change. This can be done by setting the duration of the portfolio equal to the investor’s time horizon and making sure the initial present value of the bond equals the present value of the liability in question. In our previous example, we assumed the investor intended to hold the bond for two years, presumably because he intends to use the money to fund some obligation. Thus, to immunize the portfolio, the investor should set the duration to two years. Six months later, the investment horizon will be 1.5 years, and the investor should rebalance the portfolio’s duration to equal 1.5 years, and so on. The intended result: an income portfolio that has an assured return for a specific time horizon regardless of changes in interest rates."

Executive vice president Wayne LaPierre called for more guns, remarking, “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” and then went after the gaming industry.

“And here’s another dirty little truth that the media try their best to conceal: There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows violence against its own people, through vicious, violent video games with names like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse,” he said. “And here’s one: It’s called Kindergarten Killers. It’s been online for 10 years. How come my research department could find it and all of yours either couldn’t or didn’t want anyone to know you had found it?”

LaPierre also turned his attention to film industry. “Then there’s the blood-soaked slasher films like American Psycho and Natural Born Killers that are aired like propaganda loops on Splatterdays and every day a thousand music videos that portray life as a joke and murder as a way of life. And then they have the nerve to call it entertainment,” he said. “But is that what it really is?

Cases of coronavirus across the UK are increasing by the day, now bringing the total number to 311,965. The death toll in the UK for deaths stands at 43,575 and the Government is slowly easing some restrictions.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday pubs, restaurants and hotels could reopen in England early next month, easing the coronavirus lockdown that has all but shut the economy.

In other signs of a gradual return to normal life, hairdressers will open again along with tourist attractions like theme parks, but nightclubs, indoor gyms and swimming pools will stay closed.

Mr Johnson has been under pressure from businesses, especially in the hospitality sector, and from members of his governing Conservative Party to relax the lockdown, but until now he had resisted for fear of prompting a second wave.

On Tuesday, he said with infection rates falling and little current threat of a second wave of COVID-19 cases, he could reopen swathes of the economy."

Up to 09 April 2020, more than a hundred confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from various parts of India; the majority of them have travel history to affected regions. Meanwhile, the first death was reported on 12 March 2020. The first victim was a 76-year-old man, who had returned from Saudi Arabia. COVID-19 accelerates its speed of infections, 1000 on 28 March and 1834 with death toll crossed 41 on 1 April, 2020. The numbers of cases are very less as compared to other countries, as India is the second-largest populated, developing country of the world with insufficient medical facilities. More than two million persons were screen, out of which 5734 are positive for COVID-19 by laboratory-confirmed assays, from which 166 (2.9%) die, 473 (8.25%) recovered included one migrated, while 5095 active cases are admitted in various hospitals shown in Fig. 1(https://www.mohfw.gov.in/seen on 09th April, 2020). Maharashtra (1135), Tamil Nadu (738), Delhi (669), Telangana (427), Rajasthan (381), Uttar Pradesh (361), Andhra Pradesh (348), Kerala (345), Madhya Pradesh (229), Karnataka (181) Gujarat (179) and Jammu, and Kashmir (158) are most affected sates contained 5151 out of 5734 (90%) of total laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. The Distribution of deaths and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in various Indian states and union territories as on 09th April, 2020 is shown in Fig. 2.

A total of 166 persons died, out of which 126 (75.90%) were from Maharashtra (72), Gujarat (16), Madhya Pradesh (13), Delhi (9), Tamil Nadu (8) and Punjab (8). Forty persons were died from the Telangana (7), Karnataka (5), West Bengal (5), Andhra Pradesh (4), J & K Kashmir (4), Uttar Pradesh (4), Haryana (3) Rajasthan (3), Kerala (2), Bihar (1), Himachal Pradesh (1) and Odisha (1) are shown in Fig. 4.

The distribute pattern COVID-19 other respiratory depends upon the various factor like their basic reproductive number (R ), nature of the virus, environmental condition, trade/travel with the affected area, population density and social culture. The basic reproductive number (R ) and nature of the virus are similar for the whole world; therefore the difference of outbreak potential depends on other factors. The WHO data is clearly suggested that colder and humid regions are more affected than warmer and dry regions (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). In India, initial outbreaks started in the regions, which are directly linked to the affected area via trade/travel. In expert opinion, the number of COVID-19 cases could be more but diagnostic rates of India are very low as compared with other countries. The majority of the confirmed cases were linked to other countries; therefore all tourist visas were suspended and ban the entry from effected parts to reduce the chance of infections (https://mea.gov.in/covid-19-updates.htm). To hamper the virus spread in the community, educational institutions and many other commercial activities have been shut down. To reduce the COVID-19 spread, a 14-hour voluntary public curfew was observed in the whole country at the request of Prime Minister, Modi. The government followed it up with lockdowns in COVID-19 affected parts and major cities. The Prime minister ordered a national lockdown for 21 days on 24 March 2020 (https://www.independent.co.uk). Some person does not follow the instruction; become the super spreader of COVID-19. A Sikh preacher has a travel history of the infected area (Italy and Germany) attending a Sikh festival in Anandpur Sahib on 7 March. As a result, twenty-seven positive cases of COVID-19 were identified and more than 40,000 people belong to 20 villages of Punjab needed to be quarantined. In another case, more than 2000 people including 281 foreigners attending Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation event was organized in Delhi and staying at the mosque since 8 March. About 200 people have shown symptoms, out of which, 24 people were positive for COVID-19 so far. A large number of COVID-19 cases across the country were found to be linked to the event (https://www.mohfw.gov.in). Michael Ryan, chief executive director of WHO seems to be happy with Indian efforts to control COVID-19. The COVID-19 not only dangerous for our health but the Indian economy is highly affected due to the lockdown. A large segment of the Indian population, lose their livelihood due to shut down of trades, commercial, tourist and other business activities during the lockdown."

But that information may not always come across as accurate. The Food and Drug Administration wants to make sure pharmaceutical and medical product companies don't spread misleading information through nontraditional channels.

So the FDA is proposing new social media guidelines to help companies communicate with consumers across platforms with strict space limitations like Twitter, and in paid search results on Google and Yahoo.

Some of the guidelines include posting the risks as well as benefits of prescription drugs and medical devices, even if there's only 140 characters in which to do it.

""No matter the Internet source used, benefit claims in product promotions should be balanced with risk information. And companies should provide a way for consumers to gain direct access to a more complete discussion of risks associated with their products,"" Thomas Abrams, director of FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion in the Agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) wrote on the FDA's official blog.

For example, if a company is planning to promote a memory loss drug, the FDA recommends a tweet like this:

This tweet, the FDA notes, conveys the benefit information within the first 40 character spaces, is accurate and non-misleading, and includes material facts and limitations about the fictional drug.

Officials also proposed guidelines on how to handle corrections in social media marketing, including addressing ""all misinformation in a clearly defined portion of a forum on the Internet or social media, whether the misinformation is positive or negative.""

""Prescription drugs and medical devices can provide tremendous benefits to patients, but they can also pose certain risks,"" Abrams said. ""As a regulatory agency, we are committed to ensuring that the information about these products that their manufacturers and distributors direct at patients and health care providers is accurate and balanced."""

Nostradamus' followers and conspiracy theorists credit the French mystic with predicting many future events and catastrophes, penned in cryptic poems dubbed quatrains.

Nostradamus is famously said to have predicted the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1933 and the Great Fire of London in 1666. Nostradamus penned his supposed predictions of the future in his magnum opus, the 1555 book Les Propheties. And if Nostradamus’ followers are to be believed this time around, the world could be headed for a rough year marked by political unrest, war and the threat of climate change. British psychic and medium Craig Hamilton-Parker from Psychics.co.uk also shared with Express.co.uk some of his predictions for 2020, revealing bizarre overlaps between his predictions and Nostradamus’.

Did Nostradamus predict war will break out in 2020?
• Baba Vanga 2020 prediction: END OF THE WORLD and Putin assassination Nostradamus is believed by many to have predicted the outbreak of World War 3 and some think 2020 could be the year it finally happens. Tensions in the Middle East rose high after US President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on Iran’s Major General Qassem Soleimani on January 3. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei vowed “forceful revenge” in retaliation for the attack, which the US dubbed a countermeasure against future acts of terrorism. Iran retaliated days later with a series of missile attacks on US army bases in Iraq. With the western world and the eastern world clashing, conflict in the Middle East and domestic unrest in China, the world teetered on the brink of chaos. One Nostradamus passage, in particular, could forewarn of a global conflict unfolding next year. The Nostradamus prophecy reads: “Twice put up and twice cast down, the East will also weaken the West. “Its adversary after several battles chased by sea will fail at time of need.”

Based on his own predictions for the next year, Mr Hamilton-Parker said there is a strong possibility a war will break out. However, the psychic foresaw a devastating conflict unfolding in the Middle East, rather than globally, which he said will last from 2020 until 2021. The conflict will involve “riots in Iran” and an all-out war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Off the back of the conflict, Mr Hamilton-Parker said: “Putin and Trump enforce a peace deal.” DON’T MISS

What did Nostradamus predict for Donald Trump in 2020?
• Jerusalem Third Temple: Sanhedrin are paving the way to Second Coming Nostradamus is believed to have directly referenced the US President Donald Trump in his Century 1, Quatrain 40. The passage reads: “The false trumpet concealing madness, will cause Byzantium to change its laws. “From Egypt there will go forth a man who wants, the edict withdrawn, changing money and standards.” In 2018, Mr Hamilton-Parker predicted President Trump will face an attempt on his life as well as a second term in office. And in February, a man was apprehended at the White House after intending to assassinate the US President.

In his predictions for 2020, Mr Hamilton-Parker said: “Trump will not be removed from office. “One of his closest allies betrays him – Rudy Giuliani perhaps? At the same time, Mr Hamilton-Parker said a scandal will “discredit” Mr Trump’s rival Joe Biden. Elizabeth Warren will also be announced the Democrat Presidential Contender in the 2020 US presidential race. However, Mr Hamilton-Parker said: “Donald Trump will be reelected taking unexpected states such as Florida. “The trade war with China will escalate as riots sweep China.” READ MORE: Nostradamus predictions: Astrologer’s last words proved to be correct

Nostradamus may have a cult following around the world but critics of the 16th-century mystic do not believe he had powers of foresight. Brian Dunning, the author of the Skeptoid podcast, called out people claiming prophecies out of Nostradamus’ cryptic quatrains. He said: “Nostradamus' writings are exploited in a number of fallacious ways. “Ambiguous and wrong translations, ‘creative’ interpretations, hoax writings, fictional accounts, and the breaking of non-existent codes within his quatrains all contribute to a vast body of work, all of it wrong, and many times the size of everything Nostradamus ever actually wrote.” The sceptic added: ""Michel de Nostredame was truly one of the brilliant lights of his day, but to subscribe to false stories and urban legends is to disrespect who the man actually was. ""Appreciate his contributions to medicine and Renaissance literature, and don't trivialize his good works in favour of a pretended history of paranormal magical powers."""

The American fugitive, who now lives in Moscow, told podcast host Joe Rogan that having snooped on US intelligence networks, he could find no evidence aliens are being hidden by the US government.

Snowden, 36, is a former National Security Agency contractor who spent seven years working for the NSA and CIA.

He became a whistleblower in 2013, leaking highly classified details of secret surveillance programmes by US intelligence agencies.

Snowden told Rogan that he had snooped for evidence of aliens, chemtrails and other popular conspiracy theory topics.

Chemtrails are trails of clouds seen streaking across the sky from aircraft.

But to some conspiracy theorists, they are really governments secretly releasing harmful substances in the air via planes.

Snowden has recently written about such beliefs in his memoir, Permanent Record, revealing his life story for the first time.

He told Rogan that in it: ""I talk about aliens and chemtrails and things like that, and the fact that there's no evidence for that.

""I went looking on the network. I know Joe, you want there to be aliens.""

Snowden told him: ""There probably are, right? But the idea that we're hiding them - if we are hiding them - I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups.

""So, if it's hidden, and it could be hidden, it's hidden really damn well, even from people who are on the inside.""

Snowden explains in his memoir, that ""for the record, as far as I could tell, aliens have never contacted Earth, or at least they haven't contacted US intelligence.""

He told Rogan's podcast on Wednesday that ""everyone wants to believe in conspiracy theories, because it makes life make sense.

""It helps us believe somebody is in control, somebody is calling the shots.

""There are real conspiracies, but they don't typically have tens of thousands of people working on them, unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself.""

In Permanent Record, Snowden also says, ""in case you are wondering: yes, man really did land on the moon. Climate change is real. Chemtrails are not a thing.""

This debunking was in response to conspiracy theories that the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 - which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year - was all a con.

Snowden lives in Russia, where he was granted asylum, to avoid prosecution in the US.

Many civil rights activists see him as a hero, but American authorities want him to stand trial for espionage.

The United States has sued to prevent Snowden profiting from his book because he did not seek intelligence agency review of its contents."

• President Trump at a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday pledged that America will ""very shortly"" find a cure for childhood cancer and end the AIDS epidemic.
• None ""I see what they are doing. I see it. They show me. The things we are doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it,"" said Trump to cheering supporters.
• None The rally was held the day after the Democratic debates in Detroit, and also featured the president attacking his prospective 2020 rivals.

President Trump returned to one of his wilder promises at his rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, saying that under his leadership the US will ""very shortly"" find a cure for childhood cancer and end AIDS.

""We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine,"" the president told the cheering crowd Thursday night as he ran through the achievements of his administration.

""I see what they are doing. I see it. They show me. The things we are doing in our country today. There's never been anything like it. We will be ending the AIDS epidemic shortly in America, and curing childhood cancer very shortly.""

Trump's boast was similar to one he made at a rally in Orlando, Florida, in June. At that rally he claimed ""we will come up with the cures to many, many problems, to many, many diseases — including cancer"" and would ""eradicate AIDS in America.""

At both rallies he pledged that America would soon put a man on Mars.

In his February State of the Union address, Trump pledged that the US would eradicate AIDS within ten years. His administration's 2020 budget proposal requests $291 million to combat the disease.

In the address, he also committed $50 million to pediatric cancer research, in a budget that would see the National Cancer Institute's overall budget slashed by $900 million.

Congress has previously balked at requests to slash federal cancer research funding.

Cincinnati is one of the jurisdictions targeted by the administration's ambitious AIDS plan. Public health officials met with the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ahead of Trump's rally to discuss their efforts to combat AIDS.

Advocacy groups have criticised Trump's AIDS policies, under which $1 billion was removed from global AIDS initiatives, protections for patients with the disease rolled back, and health benefits for LGBT Americans ended, according to Politico.

Trump was speaking the day after the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit, and spent much of the one-and-a-half hour speech attacking his prospective rivals in the 2020 election, and ad libbing on favorite gripes, including wind energy.

He said: ""The previous administration, they like wind mills. If a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise, they are intermittent.""

""They kill your birds. They break down. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out. And they cost a fortune and they need subsidy."""

The community, called /r/GreatAwakening, had more than 71,000 subscribers making over 10,000 comments on average per day before it was banned. A backup subreddit, /r/the_greatawakening, was also banned, along with 17 other Qanon focused communities, including r/BiblicalQ and r/Quincels.

The subreddit, which is a term for the common interest groups that make up Reddit, has been host to a stream of violent threats based on the conspiracy theory — despite repeated calls from the community’s moderators urging them to stop, particularly in recent weeks. Qanon devotees falsely believe that President Donald Trump is secretly waging a war with special counsel Robert Mueller to take down a global pedophile ring led by Hollywood celebrities and the Democratic Party, most notably Hillary Clinton.

Threats to kill Clinton pervaded GreatAwakening earlier this month when users were incensed by a Qanon-based theory that she was somehow causing military planes to fall out of the sky. GreatAwakening members implored the community to “kill all enemies”

Reddit was key to Qanon’s emergence from the fringe corners of the internet and into more mainstream conspiracy and far-right media circles. An investigation by NBC News found that moderators moved Qanon posts from 8chan, a hard-to-navigate internet message board used mostly by trolls and younger people, to Reddit, making it accessible to a larger, older, and less internet savvy audience of conspiracy theorists. From there, Qanon crept to Facebook, where it continued to grow.

A spokesman for Reddit confirmed the banning in a statement to NBC News.

“As of September 12, r/greatawakening has been banned due to repeated violations of the terms of our content policy,” the spokesperson said. “We are very clear in our site terms of service that posting content that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses will get users and communities banned from Reddit.""

In March, Reddit shut down the original Qanon subreddit, /r/CBTS_stream, for the same reason, after it was found to be “encouraging or inciting violence and posting personal and confidential information.” Reddit also banned its moderators from the site. The group had more than 20,000 subscribers at the time.

The Reddit ban will hamper the Qanon theory’s spread and splinter its followers, but it is not a death knell for the theory’s faithful community. Tens of thousands of users congregate on Twitter and in closed Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon. One of the most popular, named “QAnon Follow The White Rabbit” has more than 51,000 members. Thousands of others gather on Discord, a gaming-focused chat service that hosts channels like QNN, Q Central, and Patriot’s Soapbox, the chatroom for a 24-hour livestreamed YouTube channel for the dissemination and discussion of Qanon topics.

In August, as media coverage of Qanon increased, several of the largest Qanon Facebook groups changed their names, fearing the platform would ban them. When no action was taken, the groups reverted to their original names.

Reddit ramped up enforcement against racist, sexist and anti-Semitic subreddits earlier this week. The site pulled down the community r/MillionDollarExtreme on Monday, along with ironic offshoot communities like r/BillionShekelExtreme. The community, named after a quickly cancelled sketch show on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim from 2016, was filled with racist and antisemitic posts at the time of its banning.

Last October, Reddit banned a community devoted to Pizzagate, a smaller conspiracy theory that also alleged Clinton was running a child sex ring out of the basement of a pizza shop that had no basement. Qanon’s basic tenets hinge largely on the belief that the Pizzagate conspiracy was real all along.

Qanon believers have grown increasingly restless in recent weeks as several prophecies of “Q,” the purported government leaker sharing secrets to Qanon followers on 4chan, were proven wrong.

GreatAwakening users began to waver in their support when former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty of eight felony counts as part of Mueller’s Russia probe, and the president’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight felony charges. Q had repeatedly led posters to believe Mueller, Manafort and Cohen were working in tandem to catch the alleged child sex ring.

“Q” posted on 8chan shortly after Reddit’s action, aligning the ban with Alex Jones, who along with his website Infowars were recently removed from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple.

On its last day, r/GreatAwakening users had reverted to rote conspiracy talking points from years’ past — claiming 9/11 was an inside job, and that the Anthrax investigation was covered up by Mueller.

It is unclear precisely which post or comment was the final straw for Reddit’s ban."
287,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions Andrew Wakefield, MD, as the actor who conducted the study on the possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism.",True,The article discusses the actions of Andrew Wakefield in conducting the study and releasing a video suggesting a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Everyone knows that vaccines save lives and prevent horrible diseases such as smallpox, polio, and so on from making a comeback; at least, I hope they do. Though vaccines do fight against various diseases from reappearing, there is a belief that vaccines can actually do more harm to children than good. It all started in the 1990s when Andrew Wakefield, MD, set out to study if there was a possible link between some vaccines, specifically the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR), and neuropsychiatric diseases, specifically autism in children. After his research, he released a case series study claiming he had found evidence of a connection. Though he wrote in his paper that a causal relationship could not be shown between the MMR vaccination and autism, he released a video saying that the two were related. The damage was done. News outlets and press released these “findings”, and parents everywhere began to believe it. Celebrities endorsed the idea as well which led to an even greater following. Though these claims have since been debunked making this belief extraordinary, there are still those who refuse to vaccinate their children in fear of an autism diagnosis. I don’t think I need to explain the importance of vaccinations when it comes to eradicated, deadly diseases, but there are still people who put the importance of a falsely proven theory above their children’s disease prevention.

Wakefield began to study the possible relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism after a cohort study was released showing that people who had been vaccinated with MMR were more likely to have bowel disease than those who were not. He believed the link could be possible due to the infection from the vaccine virus. Even though he ended up finding no causal relationship between the two, he still suggested a link in a video he released later. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and beliefs, but when something has been tested and not been shown to be true, I don’t think that information should still be spread around as fact. There are plenty of people who believe this information because of pure fear for their children’s psychiatric health and because of their trust in a doctor (Wakefield) to take his word as true.

Those who still believe this could be the result of several different factors. These people have been misinformed because of Wakefield’s video saying there is a link between the two. Even though he stated in his study there was no causal relationship, people are probably more likely to have watched his video thinking there was some groundbreaking and important health research in it. They are also trusting an authority-type person’s word as fact because why shouldn’t they trust a person in their area of expertise? Lastly, fear mongering definitely plays a role in this pseudoscience. Parents will do anything to protect their kids, and if they have any reason to believe that vaccines may cause harm to them or the harm outweighs the benefits, then surely, they won’t utilize them.

Believers of this extraordinary claim come from several different communities. Though it was first thought to be mostly liberals who did not want to vaccinate their children, it has been shown that people from both ends of the political spectrum believe in this. There are also several celebrities who believe and endorse this including Jenny McCarthy, Alicia Silverstone, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. just to name a few. They use their fame to help promote their belief in not vaccinating children. Many people buy into this peripheral route of persuasion even though these celebrities have no expertise in medicine. This extraordinary belief has all the typical features of a pseudoscience including having the outward appearance of science and appealing to authority, making it easy for some individuals (especially those who have not been informed of all the facts) to believe.

Vaccines have worked wonders for our society ever since they were discovered many years ago. I can only hope that enough people still see and believe in their good use to help keep eradicated diseases from taking lives once again. People may still believe that vaccines can cause autism in children, but I hope that they would still put value in their children’s safety from potential diseases that could result from not having the proper vaccines. This pseudoscience has been proven to not be true, but fear mongering, celebrity endorsement, and the word of a doctor (Wakefield) will continue allowing people to believe."

The sudden appearance of what could be interpreted as such as sign has appeared in an unusual conspiracy video on YouTube, titled “Just down right ‘strange’ sky observations”, The eye appears to be eerily formed entirely out of clouds, and the video uploaded by popular conspiracy channel MrMBB333, claims it was seen over the Netherlands on April 22.

Scores of conspiracy theorists and fascinated people who were confronted with the footage have speculated what the nature of eye might be. Some suggested the eye was an intervention from God himself, while others have alleged “something huge is going to happen” soon. Diana M Pfeiffer, @SongofSeaphim, tweeted: “A reminder that God is always watching.” Clifford Roebuck commented on YouTube: “It's like somebody's got an eye on Earth.”

Another YouTube user, Travis Gillette posted: “Looks like both you and her might have caught some of the war in heaven. “I’ve seen several battles already, but mighty Michael and the archangels will be victorious. “And the demon clouds are getting scary. I saw a video explaining how the chemtrails are actually facilitating them. Full armour of God people.”

User Caroline 2017 also bought into the hysteria, warning: “Extremely weird and unusual events going on. Something huge is going to happen any day. “Stay safe. God bless you, have Jesus Christ in your hearts.” And News Buster said: “Some people will use this as evidence that God is watching from heaven before he casts his final judgement upon us. Not kidding.” But despite the biblical connections alleged in the video’s comment section, the viewers were similarly abuzz with various conspiracy theories about chemtrails, governmental weather control schemes and cloaked ships passing through our atmosphere.

Many of the comments alleged the eye was a result of skies “being sprayed everyday” in a bid to control climate patterns. Online conspiracists believe vapour trials left behind airplanes are in reality toxic chemicals and other substances that control the weather – despite there being absolutely no evidence to support this theory. This ridiculous claim is often liked to the US High Frequency Active and Auroral Research Programme (HAARP), which is a collaboration between the US Air Force, Navy, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Defence Advance Research Agency. Purveyors of the chemtrail conspiracy believe the US Government uses HAARP to control weather."

Fresh from dumping two dead bodies in a river, Pat sets his eyes on another enemy in tonight's double-bill.

The scheming builder tried to make Seb think that Anna Windass had deliberately tried to kill him by causing his ladder to collapse.

With Seb unconscious in the hospital, Phelan dripped poison in his ear and whispered his shocking lies to try and get Anna done for murder.

The soap villain, who forced Andy Carver to kill Vinny Ashford before turning the gun on his prisoner, came to Seb's bedside to carry out his next twisted move.

Leaning in towards Seb, he muttered: ""Anna Windass hates you, she wants you dead. You hear me. Anna Windass wants you dead. She pushed you off that ladder.""

Pheland proved to have amazing powers of persuasion, as his Jedi mind trick really did convince Seb that it was Anna that pushed him off the ladder.

Once Seb woke up, he revealed to Faye that Anna was the one that caused him to fall.

Seb said: ""Anna wants me dead. She pushed me off that a ladder.""

Viewers know that this is not the case as Anna was walking out of the cafe at the time.

However, Faye phoned the police and grassed her own mum up.

Corrie viewers took to Twitter after seeing Pat's amazing powers of persuasion.

One viewer said: ""Was enjoying the Phelan storyline but getting into Seb’s mind is utter bollox #Corrie""

Another added: ""Phelan can do cunjouring mind manipulation?! Diabolical storyline. #corrie""

A third said: ""God Phelans mind games are good!! #corrie""

They have strung rusty coils of barbed wire around its perimeter to discourage worship in the synagogue for fear of falling masonry, and they have tried to plug some holes with gravel and sand. But with no active preservation effort, the tomb seems condemned to a slow, weather-induced death.

Even by ancient standards, Nahum's life is poorly documented—it's not even certain where he's buried (a village south of Jerusalem also lays claim to him). His supposed prediction of the downfall of the Assyrian Empire more than 2,000 years ago, however, has earned him the reverence of Muslims, Christians, Jews, and Yazidis who have venerated his tomb for hundreds of years.

The Jewish community, which maintained the synagogue, largely departed for Israel after that nation's founding in 1948. Now, all of the inhabitants of the town, which is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Mosul, are Christians. They are terrified of provoking Islamic State fighters, worried that IS might target the synagogue and the ancient monasteries and churches nearby.

Their apprehension isn't entirely misplaced. The jihadist group surged to within about six miles (ten kilometers) of Alqosh last August. All but a few residents fled, fearing the same fate that befell inhabitants of other Christian towns. Those who have returned are particularly wary of the shrine's presence, which is now one of the last of its kind in the Mosul area.

""What the Islamic State is doing is best described as a war on cultural diversity,"" said Michael Danti, a co-director of the American Schools of Oriental Research's Syrian Heritage Initiative, which documents the devastation war has wreaked on the region. ""It's a war on anything deemed inappropriate for their version of Islam."" Danti's group worked in tandem with the University of Mosul until the jihadists abolished its archaeology department last year.

""Baghdad, of course, had no interest in doing anything about it, nor did the Kurds. We were stuck,"" said Bott, who now heads the University of Arizona's Iraq Conservation Program. ""It's kind of remote, and I don't think it's ever been high up on anyone's priority list.""

Prompted by the Iraqi army's disintegration in the midst of the Islamic State's lightning offensive last summer, the peshmerga assumed control of the area. The fighters hoisted the Kurdish tricolor—red, green, and white with a fiery sun in the middle—over the fortress-like police station, built earthwork defenses on a rise just up the road, and manned the double row of checkpoints outside the town.

Thomas stumbled onto the synagogue while exploring battlefields and led a team that tried to patch it up in 2007. He received a pledge of a half million dollars from a loosely organized group of Jewish jewelers in New York City to have a conservation firm repair parts of the building. But then the head of the Kurdish antiquities department at the time, Abbas al-Hussaini, stepped in with his own proposal, according to Thomas.

""He announced publicly that the KRG was taking over the restoration, then contacted us privately to tell us to continue overseeing the restoration, but that all of the foreign funds had to go directly to him,"" said Thomas, who canceled the plan, as this was unacceptable to his backers.

Nasir Sami's late father promised the town's last Jewish inhabitant—a rabbi who died in the 1980s—that he and his descendants would make basic repairs and keep an eye on the building from their house, next to the temple. But with the bid by the younger generation for asylum in the U.S. likely to be approved, Nahum looks to have lost most of his few remaining guardians."

The news that a Tennessee school has removed the Harry Potter series from its library shelves – its pastor citing the books’ “clever deception” in presenting magic as “both good and evil” – is the latest in a succession of religious prohibitions on JK Rowling’s best-selling novels.

The trend, in fact, dates back over two decades to the 1997 publication of the first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.

Opposition to the series in America, largely advanced by Christian advocacy groups, comes despite Rowling herself being a believer. When she began working on the Potter series, she was a regular worshipper at Church of Scotland services; she now worships at the Scottish Episcopal Church, the official Anglican church in Scotland.

Nor is religious disdain for Harry Potter restricted to Christians in the West. The series, for instance, has been banned from schools in the United Arab Emirates since 2002, on the grounds that its values are un-Islamic.

Similar bans have been enforced in Malaysia, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia – the last of which has trained its religious police in fighting “witchcraft”, a crime punishable by execution."

In a primary alkyl halide, the carbon that bears the halogen is directly bonded to one other carbon, in a secondary alkyl halide to two, and in a tertiary alkyl halide to three.

The methods used to prepare alkyl halides and the reactions that alkyl halides undergo frequently depend on whether the alkyl halide is primary, secondary, or tertiary.

A halogen substituent draws the electrons in the C―X bond toward itself, giving the carbon a partial positive charge (δ+) and the halogen a partial negative charge (δ-). The presence of the resulting polar covalent bond makes most alkyl halides polar compounds. Because the bond dipole (the measure of the separation of charge) of a C―X bond is the product of a charge term (largest for fluorine and smallest for iodine) and a distance term (smallest for fluorine and largest for iodine), the molecular dipole moments of alkyl halides do not vary much from one halogen to another.

The most important reactions of organohalogen compounds involve breaking the carbon-halogen bond by processes in which the halogen retains both of the electrons from the original bond and is lost as a negatively charged ion (X−). Consistent with the order of carbon-halogen bond strengths, in which the bond to fluorine is the strongest and the bond to iodine the weakest of the carbon-halogen bonds, fluorides are normally observed to be the least reactive of the alkyl halides and iodides the most reactive.

The boiling points of ethyl halides increase as the atomic number of the halogen increases. With increasing atomic number the halogen becomes more polarizable, meaning that the electric field associated with the atom is more easily distorted by the presence of nearby electric fields. Fluorine is the least polarizable of the halogens and iodine the most polarizable. An increased polarizability is associated with stronger intermolecular attractive forces of the London dispersion type (see chemical bonding: Intermolecular forces) and therefore with an increased boiling point.

Multiple halogen substitution tends to increase the boiling point: CH Cl boils at −24 °C (−11 °F), CH Cl at 40 °C (104 °F), CHCl at 61 °C (142 °F), and CCl at 77 °C (171 °F). Multiple fluorine substitution is an exception, however: CH CH F boils at −32 °C (−26 °F), CH CHF at −25 °C (−13 °F), CH CF at −47 °C (−53 °F), and CF CF at −78 °C (−108 °F). By reducing the molecular polarizability, multiple fluorine substitution weakens the strength of dispersion forces between molecules. In the liquid state these weakened intermolecular attractive forces are reflected in unusually low boiling points, and in the solid state they are responsible for the novel properties of fluorocarbon polymers.

The densities of alkyl halides are related to intermolecular attractive forces and tend to parallel boiling points, alkyl fluorides being the least dense and alkyl iodides the most dense. In general, alkyl fluorides and chlorides are less dense than water, and bromides and iodides are more dense than water. Alkyl halides are not soluble in water."

295,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions scientists and activists as actors.,True,The article discusses proposed techniques to cool the planet and the actions taken by scientists to address the challenges.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Preliminary findings presented here suggest that some proposed techniques to cool the planet manually may have fewer barriers than previously thought. But many technical and societal barriers remain.

Even before they got to the sessions, the scientists had to contend with a smattering of activists with drums, cameras, and a megaphone alleging that the government is already performing geoengineering through the spraying of particles, in so-called chemtrails.

Physicist David Keith of the University of Calgary in Canada addressed the concept of spreading aerosol droplets in the stratosphere, where they could block a small fraction of the sun's rays. A paper published last year in Environmental Research Letters suggested that the leading proposal, spraying sulfur dioxide gas, wouldn't work. Sulfur dioxide is converted in the atmosphere into droplets of sulfuric acid, which would clump and fall out of the sky before they could have much cooling effect. To get around this problem, Keith and colleagues have proposed using airplanes to spray droplets of the acid itself, rather than sulfur dioxide. In unpublished data, the team found that injecting only “a few megatons per year” of sulfuric acid could be more than twice as effective at blocking radiation as starting with sulfur dioxide.

While scientists are finding ways to overcome the engineering challenges, the environmental effects of planet-hacking techniques remain uncertain. One challenge in geoengineering a warmed planet is simultaneously restoring temperatures while minimizing disruption of rain and precipitation. (Stratospheric particles lower the total amount of energy striking Earth, the driver of precipitation.)

In previous modeling efforts, adding sun-blocking particles uniformly across the globe has tended to undercool the poles while overcooling the equator. So Kenneth Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California, modeled various approaches to try to counteract a severe warming—the result of a doubling of preindustrial CO concentration. In work yet to be published, he distributed the particles unevenly to try to minimize those effects; for example, by putting more at the poles versus the equator. (Global warming is greatest in the Arctic.) In models, that strategy helped fix the undercooling/overcooling problem, but it worsened the effects on precipitation. “There's a complex problem of how do you balance the damage that you do against the benefit,” said Caldeira.

That said, simulating either geoengineering approach to counteract global warming—distributing particles globally or focusing on the poles—suggests a cooler world with less disruption of rain patterns than one in which warming continues unabated. “In a high-global-warming world, more people would be better off with geoengineering, but some people would be worse off,” he said."

There have been over 470,000 deaths from the disease.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said: “In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported to WHO.

“In the last month, almost four million cases have been reported.

""We expect to reach a total of 10 million cases within the next week.”

He said the grim figures are a “sober reminder” that people must do all they can to limit transmission while vaccines are developed.

Britain has got on top of the epidemic but the virus continues to spread rapidly on some continents.

Dr Mike Ryan, also from the WHO, said he believes UK surveillance is now “capable of understanding where the disease is”.

And he added: “The United Kingdom has been very much guided by a very steady, slow, stepwise exit from lockdown conditions.

“Testing in the UK has increased.

""The UK has taken a stepwise approach, the UK is listening to science. Science is still driving decision-making.”

A further 154 coronavirus deaths were reported in the UK yesterday, taking the toll to 43,081, the Department of Health said.

There were also 653 newly confirmed cases, with another 232,086 tests dispatched or completed.

It means there have now been 306,862 confirmed cases of the disease nationwide - diagnosed from 8.54million checks.

Across the southwest, east to west, these white streaks can be seen almost on a daily basis. People aren’t even aware of what they are.

During my tenure in Albuquerque I learned of a small group calling themselves, “The Free Americans.” They were the first ones who actually made a film of Chem tails calling people’s attention to this crisis. They even had a show on the access station to tell of their discoveries.

A call came in from Santa Fe where two fellas, who would like to remain anonymous, came across a clump of foam that landed in their yard. By touching it, one of the men received severe burns on his hands. They took the sample to Santa Fe College where they had the substance analyzed.

The list of ingredients filled a piece of paper and it was quite a soup. The list started out with Aluminum Oxide along with Barium, Benzene, Cesium, and a few viruses just to name a few. When this concoction is mixed with jet fuel, it is the Aluminum Oxide that expands into those white trails. The heavier particles drop like fallout as the wind carries them for miles.

When I first visited Albuquerque in 1986, it was a quaint town with three major hospitals and I learned of the Cancer Society which was just a little house on 13th Street. While in this city, I had the opportunity to watch quite a phenomenon going on. All the hospitals doubled in size with new construction as Lovelace built a brand new building over by UNM Hospital and Presbyterian.

In my 15-year stay, I saw three new cancer hospitals go up. I wondered who they all were expecting. With a bit of investigation and a few confessions, it appeared that they knew they would have company if our society kept up with the polluting of the air, poisoning the drinking water and poisoning our food supply. A Naturopath once told me, “If you cannot pronounce it, don’t eat it”!

All you have to do is connect all the dots and you will find the motive. Ask yourself, Who is running this store anyhow? Why are the IQs in children going down instead of up? Children coming down with cancer and autism. The hospitals filling up to over flowing.

We need to find the magician behind the curtain and then we can have some answers. People are dying unnecessarily, and ignorance is what is killing us. At one time Deming water was pure and that was the advertising that first brought me here. I was sick and overweight and within six months on the water brought my weight down and I was no longer sick with very low blood pressure.

The talk of drought started 25 years ago and with simple deduction we can see why. Climate change has been manufactured and yes, there is global warming because of chem trail activity all around the world. We no longer fly the friendly skies. Here is a clue. For those who use antiperspirants, what is the drying agent used? Go look and you will find out it is aluminum. Now it stands to reason that if we have been getting sprayed for 25 years with aluminum, wouldn’t this be the major cause of drought and global warming? Now the question is, can this be corrected before the weather becomes a terror like all the disaster movies predict?

We are a smart an innovative country and don’t you think we can come up with a solution? Would you call Chem trailing, domestic terrorism? Find the culprit and it will stop. I have heard all of the excuses from the politicians and it just doesn’t wash. Their hypothesis just doesn’t hold hot water.

299,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,Saddam Hussein is explicitly mentioned as the main actor in the article.,True,The article discusses Saddam Hussein's actions and decisions regarding weapons of mass destruction.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections.,True,Saddam Hussein's deception and secret development programs indicate secrecy.,"For years, Saddam Hussein showed himself to be a master practitioner of the big bluff. Everyone outside Iraq and just about everyone inside believed that he harbored a secret stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. So imagine the shock his generals received in late 2002 when U.S. forces were massing on the country's borders for an imminent invasion, and Saddam suddenly informed them that Iraq had no biological or chemical or nuclear weapons at all. Longtime aide Tariq Aziz told U.S. interrogators that military morale plummeted the moment senior officers learned Iraq would have to fight the U.S. without those weapons. The dictator's cunning policy of deception had deceived the wrong side.

Saddam had always hoped to dictate how history would view him. In his mind, he was the successor to great Iraqi heroes like Nebuchadnezzar and Saladin, to be revered as a giant among them for millenniums. But the Saddam who emerges from the pages of a new, comprehensive CIA report on Iraq's alleged arsenal will be remembered for the colossal misjudgments that cost him his rule. The exhaustive detail compiled by the report's author, Charles Duelfer, chief U.N. weapons inspector in the 1990s and the Bush Administration's top hunter since January, richly fills in the previous portrait of a paranoid and brutal dictator who believed that weapons of mass destruction (WMD) were the prime tools with which to advance his extravagant ambitions. Drawn from lengthy interrogations of the core Iraqi leadership and Saddam during their months in U.S. custody, the Duelfer report sheds fresh light on the dictator's inner motivations and artful deceptions.

Saddam was awed by science and impressed by the way technology conveyed military power. To him, WMD were a telling symbol of strength and modernity, and he thought any country that could develop them had an intrinsic right to do so. In his experience, through 25 years and two wars, WMD had also saved his neck. In the 1980s war with Iran, he concluded that chemical shells had repelled the enemy's human-wave attacks and that ballistic missiles had broken the will of its leaders. He was convinced that his readiness to use WMD during the Gulf War in 1991 had prevented the U.S.-led liberators of Kuwait from marching all the way to Baghdad to topple his regime. In a closed-door chat between Saddam and a senior aide just before the Gulf War began, the report says, he had ordered that ""germ and chemical warheads ... be in [military officers'] hands asap"" and targeted to hit Riyadh and Jeddah, ""the biggest Saudi cities with all the decision-makers and where the Saudi rulers live,"" as well as ""all the Israeli cities."" He had squelched the Kurdish rebellion by gassing villages and put down the Shi'ite uprising in the wake of the Gulf War with the help of nerve gas.

But by the spring of 1991, Saddam faced a critical decision. Though defeated on the battlefield, he had kept stocks of WMD squirreled away and maintained secret development programs. Now he faced tough postwar U.N. sanctions that would cripple Iraq unless he got rid of the WMD. Saddam made a calculated decision, says the report, that getting out from under sanctions was of paramount importance. He opted for a ""tactical retreat"" by ordering the elimination of what he had left: all biological, chemical and nuclear programs were abandoned, stockpiles destroyed. The vast array of evidence uncovered to date shows that when the U.S. invaded in March 2003, Saddam had not been armed with WMD for a decade and that his ability to make new ones had been in a state of continual degradation."

In foreshadowing an open-ended military and diplomatic offensive, secretary of state Colin Powell plainly expects unquestioning cooperation from all countries, great and small. This blunt message to all and sundry is: now we cut the crap. You are either for us or against us. We are going to win. Back us - or you, too, will lose.

These propositions demand urgent scrutiny - for despite Mr Bush's initial caution, here is the looming, daunting prospect of superpower unleashed, of Prometheus unbound. And America's friends must think hard and fast about what they are getting into. Did the world really change this week? For the American people, yes, without doubt. They discovered in the most awful fashion that they were vulnerable, en masse, to foreign enemies; and that their government could not protect them. For other nations that have long lived with terrorism, only the scale changed. But for Americans, the illusion of safety shattered. A culture of impunity in which US governments act abroad with little fear of direct consequences at home was smashed as utterly as Manhattan's doomed towers.

Is the US now justified in demanding unstinting support? Yes, but that support cannot be unthinking, too. It is incumbent upon Mr Bush to define the threat he would eradicate and the scope of the measures he might employ. The options in the shadowy world he is about to enter range from a full-scale, Gulf war-style mobilisation against Afghanistan to aerial attacks and special forces incursions. In prospect too, perhaps, is a return to Reagan era covert operations, snatch squads, secret funds, state subversion, and even political assassination. And as far as can be ascertained now, such activity may not be confined to crushing Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. This uncontained American campaign potentially leads to the very gates of Damascus, to Tehran and even more likely, to Saddam Hussein's Baghdad.

The danger that others will exploit America's war for their own purposes is also apparent. Russia, for example, says it is happy to help crush terrorists, especially the Chechen variety. Israel is already acting as if it had received a green light for intensified repression in the Occupied Territories. Pakistan, pivotal in any Afghan operation, will doubtless want a quid pro quo, perhaps over its links to Kashmiri terrorism. And what will China's price be? Silence on Tibet? In Washington, meanwhile, another woeful prospect is the predicted collapse of congressional opposition to Mr Bush's rogue-bashing missile defence plans.

That Nato, the UN, G8, and the EU have rallied to America's banner is only right. The US deserves every sympathy and should be supported in taking all reasonable measures to find and punish this week's culprits. But international institutions, like governments, have a broader duty in the dangerous days ahead to deflect and mitigate the wilder lunges of this wounded superpower. Whether they can do so, given America's present mood, will give us a first measure of Mr Bush's crusading new world."
301,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions several actors, including Trump, Flynn, Sally Yates, Roger Stone, Mike Pence, H.R. McMaster, and Barack Obama.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by Trump, Flynn, and others, such as firing Flynn, defending Flynn, replacing Flynn with McMaster, and Flynn offering to testify in exchange for immunity.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,"The article connects events and observations, such as Flynn's loyalty to Trump, Trump's fondness for generals, and Flynn's tendency toward conspiracy theories.",False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Trump has exhibited a remarkable amount of loyalty to Flynn, despite ultimately firing him. Flynn’s ouster came a full 18 days after the acting attorney general at the time, Sally Yates, warned the White House that his talks with Russia made him susceptible to blackmail. Trump was “stampeded into” firing Flynn, said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant who is himself under scrutiny in the Russia probe.

“I think he likes Flynn, and he thinks he did him a disservice,” Stone said. “On the other hand we don’t know what Flynn has done, if anything, in addition to the things we know.”

“They got so close during the campaign,” said a senior White House official who was brought on by Flynn and has stayed after his departure. When Flynn left, “the real person who probably took it hardest was the president because General Flynn was the person closest to him on national-security matters.”

Flynn was asked to resign on February 13 after it was publicly revealed that he had lied about his contacts with the Russian ambassador, including to Vice President Mike Pence, who had gone on television defending him. He was replaced by H.R. McMaster, a decorated and respected general who cleared out some Flynn appointees but kept others on the National Security Council.

But Flynn has continued to percolate around the edges of this administration. On March 31, his lawyer Robert Kelner released a statement saying that Flynn would testify in exchange for immunity. “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Kelner wrote.

Trump “has questioned whether he should have fired Flynn,” a source close to the White House told The Atlantic last week. “They don’t know what Flynn's going to say.""

Flynn had joined the campaign at a time when many other Republicans were still steering clear. He wholeheartedly embraced Trumpian politics, famously leading a “lock her up” chant at the Republican convention. Flynn had come on to advise the campaign during the primaries, and was even considered for the running-mate slot.

In some ways, it was an unlikely relationship; Flynn had been a registered Democrat, and although he had had a long and storied career in the military, he had left under less-than-stellar terms after then-President Barack Obama dismissed him from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.* In recent years, Flynn had shown a tendency toward Islamophobic sentiment and a weakness for conspiracy theories. But Trump’s affinity for Flynn appears to have been unshaken. Trump has shown a fondness for generals, and has picked several for his administration: Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, and, after Flynn was given the boot, McMaster.

The Trump people can’t say they weren’t warned. (Indeed, Obama is reported to have explicitly warned Trump not to hire Flynn in a meeting during the transition.) “We all knew Flynn had issues,” a senior White House official told me last month. During the transition, Flynn became a frequent story, especially when news outlets discovered his son’s Twitter account which pushed Pizzagate conspiracy theories and interacted with figures on the alt-right."
302,False,This article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,There is no explicit mention or indirect mention of any actor responsible for a threat or malicious actions.,False,There is no mention of any purposeful and intentional actions with malicious motives.,False,There is no mention of any threats caused by actors' actions.,False,There is no connection of events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,There is no indication of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"So TerraPower’s engineers are experimenting with different types of metals, at different temperatures. In December they will put thousands of samples into a Russian reactor that will irradiate them for six years, with neutrons of the same energy that TerraPower’s reactor would have. At the end of this decade, they will see how the metals’ strength was changed, and predict if the metal will survive for 30 years.

Another problem is that when uranium is split, some of the fragments are gases. This is tolerable in current fuels, but no fuel could hold a 30-year accumulation.

Simply designing the core of the reactor is an additional problem. TerraPower engineers call it a “traveling wave reactor,” because the area in which the uranium 238 has been converted to plutonium and can be fissioned travels through the core like a wave.

But every time the designers change the thickness or type of metal they are using, the flow of neutrons will change, too, and the 30-year life of the core is so long that the inventory of fission products, some of which absorb neutrons, will also change, as some unstable materials give off radiation and transmute themselves into something else.

To allow the neutrons to travel at a speed that is best for converting waste uranium into plutonium fuel, the reactor uses sodium, not water, to moderate the neutrons’ speed and carry off the usable heat. But hot sodium burns on contact with air.

TerraPower is not alone in pursuing a reactor that will turn waste uranium into energy, and if such a concept can be commercialized, Mr. Gates might not be the first to do it. General Atomics, which has decades of experience in nuclear power, but is probably best known for producing the Predator drone, is pursuing what it calls an “energy multiplier” reactor module on the same general principal. General Atomics, which is based in San Diego, would use helium, not sodium, however, potentially simplifying some problems.

“You just set it up, let it burn, and it goes,” said John Parmentola, the company’s senior vice president.

Like TerraPower, General Atomics is courting the Chinese."

The ex-National Security Agency contractor told podcast host Joe Rogan that Lunar landing conspiracy theorists are wrong about the Apollo missions being part of a global hoax.

This debunking was in response to conspiracy theories that the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 - which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year - was all a con.

Nasa won the space race to the Moon on July 20, 1969 and 650million people watched televised footage of astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on its surface.

But an American man called Bill Kaysing started the moon-hoax conspiracy, publishing a pamphlet called We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, which included lots of conspiracy theories.

Snowden, 36, is a former contractor who spent seven years working for the NSA and CIA in America.

He became a whistleblower in 2013, leaking highly classified details of secret surveillance programmes by US intelligence agencies.

Snowden told comedian Rogan that he had snooped for evidence of aliens, chemtrails and other popular conspiracy theory topics.

Chemtrails are trails of clouds seen streaking across the sky from aircraft.

But to some conspiracy theorists, they are really governments secretly releasing harmful substances in the air via planes.

Snowden has recently written about such beliefs in his memoir, Permanent Record, revealing his life story for the first time.

He told Rogan that in it: ""I talk about aliens and chemtrails and things like that, and the fact that there's no evidence for that.

""I went looking on the network. I know Joe, you want there to be aliens.""

Snowden told him: ""There probably are, right? But the idea that we're hiding them - if we are hiding them - I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups.

""So, if it's hidden, and it could be hidden, it's hidden really damn well, even from people who are on the inside.""

Snowden explains in his memoir, that ""for the record, as far as I could tell, aliens have never contacted Earth, or at least they haven't contacted US intelligence.""

He told Rogan's podcast on Wednesday that ""everyone wants to believe in conspiracy theories, because it makes life make sense.

""It helps us believe somebody is in control, somebody is calling the shots.

""There are real conspiracies, but they don't typically have tens of thousands of people working on them, unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself.""

In Permanent Record, Snowden also says, ""in case you are wondering: yes, man really did land on the moon. Climate change is real. Chemtrails are not a thing.""

Snowden lives in Russia, where he was granted asylum, to avoid prosecution in the US.

Many civil rights activists see him as a hero, but American authorities want him to stand trial for espionage.

The United States has sued to prevent Snowden profiting from his book because he did not seek intelligence agency review of its contents."

In foreshadowing an open-ended military and diplomatic offensive, secretary of state Colin Powell plainly expects unquestioning cooperation from all countries, great and small. This blunt message to all and sundry is: now we cut the crap. You are either for us or against us. We are going to win. Back us - or you, too, will lose.

These propositions demand urgent scrutiny - for despite Mr Bush's initial caution, here is the looming, daunting prospect of superpower unleashed, of Prometheus unbound. And America's friends must think hard and fast about what they are getting into. Did the world really change this week? For the American people, yes, without doubt. They discovered in the most awful fashion that they were vulnerable, en masse, to foreign enemies; and that their government could not protect them. For other nations that have long lived with terrorism, only the scale changed. But for Americans, the illusion of safety shattered. A culture of impunity in which US governments act abroad with little fear of direct consequences at home was smashed as utterly as Manhattan's doomed towers.

Is the US now justified in demanding unstinting support? Yes, but that support cannot be unthinking, too. It is incumbent upon Mr Bush to define the threat he would eradicate and the scope of the measures he might employ. The options in the shadowy world he is about to enter range from a full-scale, Gulf war-style mobilisation against Afghanistan to aerial attacks and special forces incursions. In prospect too, perhaps, is a return to Reagan era covert operations, snatch squads, secret funds, state subversion, and even political assassination. And as far as can be ascertained now, such activity may not be confined to crushing Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. This uncontained American campaign potentially leads to the very gates of Damascus, to Tehran and even more likely, to Saddam Hussein's Baghdad.

The danger that others will exploit America's war for their own purposes is also apparent. Russia, for example, says it is happy to help crush terrorists, especially the Chechen variety. Israel is already acting as if it had received a green light for intensified repression in the Occupied Territories. Pakistan, pivotal in any Afghan operation, will doubtless want a quid pro quo, perhaps over its links to Kashmiri terrorism. And what will China's price be? Silence on Tibet? In Washington, meanwhile, another woeful prospect is the predicted collapse of congressional opposition to Mr Bush's rogue-bashing missile defence plans.

308,True,The article discusses a small group of conservative Roman Catholics who believe in geocentrism and argue that heliocentrism is a conspiracy theory to squelch the church's influence.,True,"The article mentions James Phillips, leader Robert Sungenis, and Brother Guy Consolmagno as individuals who are involved in promoting the geocentric theory.",True,The article discusses the actions of the small group of conservative Roman Catholics who challenge modern science and seek to get scientists to reconsider the heliocentric theory.,False,There is no mention of any threats in the article.,True,The article discusses the pattern of belief in geocentrism among a small group of conservative Roman Catholics and their arguments against heliocentrism.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"Some people believe the world literally revolves around them. It's a belief born not of selfishness but faith.

A small group of conservative Roman Catholics is pointing to a dozen biblical verses and the Church's original teaching as proof that the Earth is the center of the universe, the view that prompted Galileo Galilei's clash with the Church four centuries ago.

The relatively obscure movement has gained a following among a few Chicago-area Catholics who find comfort in knowing there are still staunch defenders of original Church doctrine.

""This subject is, as far as I can see, an embarrassment to the modern church because the world more or less looks upon geocentrism or someone who believes it in the same boat as the flat Earth,"" said James Phillips, of Cicero.

Phillips attends Our Lady Immaculate Catholic Church in Oak Park, a parish run by the Society of St. Pius X, a group that rejects most of the modernizing reforms the Vatican II council made from 1962 to 1965.

But by challenging modern science, the proponents of a geocentric universe are challenging the very church they seek to serve and protect.

""I have no idea who these people are. Are they sincere, or is this a clever bit of theater?"" said Brother Guy Consolmagno, the curator of meteorites and spokesman for the Vatican Observatory.

Indeed, those promoting geocentrism argue that heliocentrism, or the centuries-old consensus among scientists that the Earth revolves around the sun, is nothing more than a conspiracy theory to squelch the church's influence.

""Heliocentrism becomes 'dangerous' if it is being propped up as the true system when, in fact, it is a false system,"" said Robert Sungenis, leader of a budding movement to get scientists to reconsider. ""False information leads to false ideas, and false ideas lead to illicit and immoral actions — thus the state of the world today. … Prior to Galileo, the church was in full command of the world; and governments and academia were subservient to her.""

Sungenis is no lone Don Quixote, as illustrated by the hundreds of curiosity seekers, skeptics and supporters at a conference last fall titled ""Galileo Was Wrong. The Church Was Right"" just off the University of Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Ind.

Astrophysicists at Notre Dame didn't appreciate the group hitching its wagon to the prestige of America's flagship Catholic university and resurrecting a concept that's extinct for a reason.

""It's an idea whose time has come and gone,"" astrophysics professor Peter Garnavich said. ""There are some people who want to move the world back to the 1950s when it seemed like a better time. These are people who want to move the world back to the 1250s. I don't really understand it at all.""

Garnavich said the theory of geocentrism violates what he believes should be a strict separation of church and science. One answers why, the other answers how, and never the twain should meet, he said.

But supporters of the theory contend that there is scientific evidence to support geocentrism, just as there is evidence to support the six-day story of creation in Genesis.

There is proof in Scripture that the Earth is the center of the universe, Sungenis said. Among many verses, he cites Joshua 10:12-14 as definitive proof: ""And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, while the nation took vengeance on its foe. … The sun halted in the middle of the sky; not for a whole day did it resume its swift course.""

But Ken Ham, founder of the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Ky., said the Bible is silent on geocentrism.

""There's a big difference between looking at the origin of the planets, the solar system and the universe and looking at presently how they move and how they are interrelated,"" Ham said. ""The Bible is neither geocentric or heliocentric. It does not give any specific information about the structure of the solar system.""

Just as Ham challenges the foundation of natural history museums, Sungenis challenges planetariums, most notably the Vatican Observatory.

Consolmagno said the very premise of going after Galileo illustrates the theory's lack of scientific credibility.

""Of course, we understand the universe in a far more nuanced way than Galileo did 400 years ago,"" he said. ""And I would hope that the next 400 years would see just as much development.""

But Sungenis said the renewed interest in geocentrism is due, in part, to the efforts of Christians entering the scientific domain previously dominated by secularists. These Christian scientists, he said, showed modern science is without scientific foundation or even good evidence.

The issue has even sparked a debate between Art and Pat Jones, of Lyons. Pat Jones, a conservative Catholic who often attends Mass at Phillips' parish, said heliocentrism is part of a conspiracy.

""Because of our fallen nature in Christian terms, we take the line of least resistance — go with the flow,"" said Pat Jones. ""But the means of grace have to be intact.""

Her husband, Art, a self-described skeptical Protestant, says he is still a ""doubting Thomas"" but wouldn't put it past the orthodox science community to cook up a conspiracy. He accompanied his wife to the South Bend conference to learn more and ""keep peace in the family.""

Meanwhile, the theory has brought others like Phillips closer to God.

""I dropped my practice of faith,"" Phillips said. ""When I came back, it was a big wake-up call for me. … The world has its own dogmas."""

Passwords belonging to Rudy Giuliani and 13 other top staff members are available to buy online, according to a Channel 4 investigation.

It's an embarrassing blow for Trump ahead of his tomorrow's inauguration.

Hackers recently toyed with Giuliani by crashing his own ""embarrassingly outdated"" website this week.

And now it has emerged that Trump's White House policy directors and some of his most senior advisers have fallen victim massive social network hacks and as a result their personal details have been for sale on the web for some time.

Experts claim these breaches could leave the individuals, and the White House, vulnerable to foreign foes.

It will raise questions over President Trump's choices for his aides.

Soon-to-be national security advisor Lt Gen Michael Flynn - who famously pushed the #PizzaGate scandal - has been hacked in the past.

From Friday he will take up a crucial role stationed inside the White House reporting directly to Trump.

There is no indication that the victims of these recently reported hacks are still using these login details.

But security researcher Troy Hunt said that the leaks could be problematic for national security.

He told Channel 4: ""How many passwords have we got that have been reused in different places and are the same as they were five years ago – even a decade ago. We’ve got a long tail of info that we’ve left on the web now.

""The problem here is that a little bit like all of us, we have this propensity to reuse our passwords.

The report also suggested that restrictive German laws may have prevented the earlier discovery of the Hamburg al Qaeda cell responsible for the attacks.

The report's authors complained that U.S. and even German intelligence agencies failed to identify what it described as a growing threat of terrorism in the years leading up to Sept. 11. It accused CIA director George Tenet of being ""either unwilling or unable to marshal the full range of intelligence community resources necessary to combat the growing threat.""

In its most damning assessments, the over 800-page report accused the FBI and CIA of failing to communicate with each other at critical times and of ignoring or responding too slowly to signs of terrorist threats. Congressional investigators further alleged that the agencies failed to translate conversations between suspected terrorists and missed a number of chances to foil the plot to hijack planes and use them as bombs to destroy the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

The report went on to criticize Germany for restrictive laws that made cooperation between intelligence agencies difficult.

""Significant legal barriers restricted Germany's ability to target Islamic fundamentalism,"" the report stated. ""Before Sept. 11, it was not illegal in Germany to be a member of a foreign terrorist organization, to raise funds for terrorists, or plan a terrorist attack outside Germany.""

The report noted that Germany's intelligence apparatus ""was deliberately fragmented to make abuses of power more difficult. This fragmentation also made coordination and information sharing more difficult."" It also concluded the German government ""apparently did not consider Islamic groups a threat and were unwilling to devote significant investigative resources to this target (al Qaeda).""

In the report, the assistant director of the American FBI's counterterrorism division is quoted saying that ""the Germans were so restrictive prior to Sept. 11 with their constitution about what they can and cannot do, that they could do very little.""

The discovery that three of the Sept. 11 terrorists lived in Hamburg and may have planned the attacks while in the country deeply shook German officials, who quickly pushed for the tightening of laws to make it easier to investigate and take action against those suspected of having ties to terrorist organizations.

Just months after the terrorist attacks, Germany's parliament approved legislation that made it possible for the government to ban organizations that use the cover of religion to pursue extremist goals, commit crimes or support violent or terrorist organizations in other countries. The law enabled the Interior Ministry to ban the extremist Islamic organization known as the Caliphate State, led by Turkish-born Metin Kaplan, and al Aqsa, the fundraising arm of the Middle East terrorist group Hamas. Since the law’s passage in 2001, 16 Islamic groups have been banned in Germany.

The country has also embarked on the largest investigation in its postwar history -- a probe that won the praise of the State Department in its latest anti-terrorism report in May 2003. More than 600 officers from the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) and the FBI probed the roots of the Hamburg al Qaeda cell. The investigation has already led to two trials and the conviction of Mounir al Motassadeq, a Moroccan student who associated with and provided financial support for the terror cell."

“The world is in a new and dangerous phase,” Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva. “The virus is still spreading fast, it is still deadly, and most people are still susceptible.”

More than 8.53 million people have been reported infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 453,834​ have died, a Reuters tally showed as of 1326 GMT on Friday.

Tedros, whose leadership of the WHO has been severely criticised by U.S. President Donald Trump, urged people to maintain social distancing and “extreme vigilance.”

As well as the Americas, a large number of new cases were coming from South Asia and the Middle East, Tedros added.

WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan drew attention to the situation in Brazil, where he said there had been 1,230 additional COVID-19 deaths in the previous 24 hours.

About 12 percent of infections in Brazil involved healthcare workers, he added, praising their bravery.

Brazil has the world’s worst outbreak outside the United States, with 978,142 confirmed cases and 47,748 deaths.

With many nations easing restrictions but fearful of a second wave of infections, Ryan urged a gradual and scientific approach.

“Exiting lockdowns must be done carefully, in a step-wise manner, and must be driven by the data,” he said. “If don’t know where it is the chances are the virus will surprise you.”

Ryan said the resurgence of new clusters did not necessarily mean a second wave, while “second peaks” were also possible in one wave. The emergencies expert praised Germany, China and South Korea for their handling of the pandemic.

With trials underway around the world to find medicines and a vaccine for COVID-19, WHO officials warned that large-scale testing would be needed with side-effects carefully monitored.

“Although it is not impossible to find a vaccine ... it’s going to be a very difficult journey,” Tedros said."

Edward Snowden shut down the conspiracy theory that the US government is secretly harboring aliens at its top secret facilities during an episode of ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast, which aired on Wednesday.

Snowden, an American whistleblower who revealed details of classified US government surveillance programs in 2013, addressed rumors about secret extraterrestrial lifeforms in his recently released memoir ""Permanent Record.""

""I know, Joe, I know you want there to be aliens,"" he said. ""I know Neil deGrasse Tyson badly wants there to be aliens. And there probably are, right?""

Speaking to Rogan from Russia, where he has been granted asylum, Snowden said as far as he knew the US government has not made contact with aliens and is not housing them at their facilities, like that of Area 51 in Nevada.

""But the idea that we're hiding them — if we are hiding them — I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups. I couldn't find anything,"" he asserted.

He said, he found no evidence of extraterrestrial life during his time spent snooping through government databases when he worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

He admitted that it was entirely possible that knowledge of alien contact were ""hidden really damn well"" from people with direct access to classified information.

""Everybody wants to believe in conspiracy theories because it helps life make sense,"" he told Rogan. ""It helps us believe that somebody is in control, that somebody is calling the shots.""

In his book, which came out last month, Snowden shut down other popular conspiracy theories, like the idea that the US faked the moon landing, or that climate science is a hoax.

""For the record, as far as I could tell, aliens have never contacted Earth, or at least they haven't contacted US intelligence,"" he wrote.

""Yes, man really did land on the moon. Climate change is real. Chemtrails are not a thing,"" he added."
313,True,The article suggests that there was a cover-up regarding the rainmaking experiments and the government's knowledge of them.,True,"The article mentions a team of international scientists, the RAF, and the Ministry of Defence as being involved in the rainmaking experiments.",True,The article describes the rainmaking experiments and the actions taken by the scientists and the RAF to create artificial rain.,False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,True,The article connects events and observations related to the rainmaking experiments and the subsequent flood in Lynmouth.,True,The article suggests that there was secrecy surrounding the rainmaking experiments and the government's denial of knowledge.,"The disaster was officially termed ""the hand of God"" but new evidence from previously classified government files suggests that a team of international scientists working with the RAF was experimenting with artificial rainmaking in southern Britain in the same week and could possibly be implicated.

Squadron Leader Len Otley, who was working on what was known as Operation Cumulus, has told the BBC that they jokingly referred to the rainmaking exercise as Operation Witch Doctor.

His navigator, Group Captain John Hart, remembers the success of these early experiments: ""We flew straight through the top of the cloud, poured dry ice down into the cloud. We flew down to see if any rain came out of the cloud. And it did about 30 minutes later, and we all cheered.""

The meteorological office has in the past denied there were any rainmaking experiments conducted before 1955, but a BBC Radio 4 history investigation, to be broadcast tonight, has unearthed documents recently released at the public record office showing that they were going on from 1949 to 1955. RAF logbooks and personnel corroborate the evidence.

Until now, the Ministry of Defence has categorically denied knowledge of any cloud-seeding experiments taking place in the UK during early August 1952. But documents suggest that Operation Cumulus was going on between August 4 and August 15 1952. The scientists were based at Cranfield school of aeronautics and worked in collaboration with the RAF and the MoD's meteorological research flight based at Farnborough. The chemicals were provided by ICI in Billingham.

Met office reports from these dates describe flights undertaken to collect data on cumulus cloud temperature, water content, icing rate, vertical motions and turbulence, and water droplet and ice crystal formation. There is no mention of cloud seeding.

But a 50-year-old radio broadcast unearthed by Radio 4 describes an aeronautical engineer and glider pilot, Alan Yates, working with Operation Cumulus at the time and flying over Bedfordshire, spraying quantities of salt. He was elated when the scientists told him this had led to a heavy downpour 50 miles away over Staines, in Middlesex.

""I was told that the rain had been the heaviest for several years - and all out of a sky which looked summery ... there was no disguising the fact that the seedsman had said he'd make it rain, and he did. Toasts were drunk to meteorology and it was not until the BBC news bulletin [about Lynmouth] was read later on, that a stony silence fell on the company,"" said Mr Yates at the time.

Operation Cumulus was put on hold indefinitely after the tragedy.

Declassified minutes from an air ministry meeting, held in the war office on November 3, 1953, show why the military were interested in increasing rain and snow by artificial means. The list of possible uses included ""bogging down enemy movement"", ""incrementing the water flow in rivers and streams to hinder or stop enemy crossings"", and clearing fog from airfields.

The documents also talk of rainmaking having a potential ""to explode an atomic weapon in a seeded storm system or cloud. This would produce a far wider area of radioactive contamination than in a normal atomic explosion"".

UK weather modification experiments at the time presaged current practice in the US. The idea was to target ""super cool"" clouds, and to increase the volume of freezing water vapour particles. Most methods involved firing particles of salt, dry ice, or silver iodide, into clouds, either from an aeroplane or from burners on the ground. The clouds would then precipitate, pulled down below freezing point by the extra weight of dense particles, thus making it rain sooner and heavier than it might have done. Significantly, it was claimed that silver iodide could cause a downpour up to 300 miles away.

Many countries now use the technology, which has considerably improved during the past 50 years.

But controversy still surrounds the efficacy of these early cloud-seeding experiments. In 1955 questions were asked in the Commons about the possibilites of liability and compensation claims. Documents seen by the BBC suggest that both the air ministry and the Treasury became very anxious and were aware that rainmaking could cause damage, not just to military targets and personnel, but also to civilians.

The British Geological Survey has recently examined soil sediments in the district of Lynmouth to see if any silver or iodide residues remain. The testing has been limited due to restrictions in place because of foot and mouth disease, and it is inconclusive. However, silver residue has been discovered in the catchment waters of the river Lyn. The BGS will investigate further over the next 18 months.

Survivors of the Lynmouth flood called for - but never got - a full investigation into the causes of the disaster. Rumours persist to this day of planes circling before the inundation.

The idea of an apocalypse, a time of catastrophic suffering, has existed for thousands of years.

Although things seemed bleak during ancient times of crisis, my research on ancient apocalypticism and its long history suggests that cultivating hope during times of chaos was essential.

The word apocalypticism comes from the ancient Greek word “apokalypsis,” meaning a “revealing” or a “revelation.” Scholars define apocalypticism as a social and religious movement that sees the world in stark terms, such as dramatic visions that reveal a battle between good and evil and a coming judgment day.

In more general terms, apocalypticism explained the cause of a crisis and how people should respond to it. The future, in most forms of apocalyptic thinking, meant imminent cataclysmic change: a new kingdom, a new world order.

Apocalyptic ideas are an important theme in the Bible. The biblical Book of Revelation, for example, was written during a time of political upheaval when Christians were being persecuted.

Its dramatic visions included the “woman sitting on a scarlet beast…with seven heads and ten horns.” This vision, which probably alluded to the tyranny of imperial political authorities, was paradoxically a source of inspiration for early Christians, because it gave voice to their suffering.

But long before Revelation was written, apocalyptic thinking took root in ancient Judaism during times of significant political unrest, violent oppression and social devastation.

The Book of Daniel reflects one such crisis: Parts of this book were written in response to the conquests of Jerusalem by a Seleucid king named Antiochus Epiphanes. Antiochus desecrated the Jewish sacred temple in Jerusalem in the second century B.C. by setting up an altar to the God Zeus within the temple’s precincts.

The book addresses the suffering of the people, it recalls the history of violence and portrays this history with terrifying visions. But it also speaks of a coming judgment day that will be followed by a new kingdom – a kingdom that is everlasting and stands in contrast to the oppression of earlier times.

The Dead Sea Scrolls, dating to the period just after the apocalyptic writings in the Book of Daniel, spoke of impending terrible battles between good and evil.

Much of what scholars know about the Jewish community that wrote and preserved the Dead Sea Scrolls, speaks to a people in the throes of what appeared to be the end times.

The origins of Christianity lie in early Jewish apocalyptic worldviews: John the Baptist, Jesus, and the apostle Paul all seemed to have apocalyptic worldviews and preached messages about the imminent end times.

With its emphasis on a coming judgment day, one often accompanied by dramatic and destructive transformations, apocalypticism seems pessimistic. It certainly speaks to dire circumstances, as well as to fear and suffering.

But there is an important feature of apocalypticism that is often overlooked and it helps to explain why it continues to resurface throughout history and in our own times.

In powerful and important ways, apocalypticism was about hope. The ancient Greek word for hope – elpis – illuminates just how closely associated fear and hope were in the ancient world: Elpis referred to the anticipation or expectation of a good and safe future, but it could also refer to the fear of the unknown.

Apocalypticism cultivated a sense of meaning and encouragement through dire circumstances. It sought to make sense of suffering, and it predicted an end to suffering. In doing so, it gave people hope. Above all, apocalyptic thinking bonded people together in uncertain and challenging times.

Paul wrote that the judgment day will come “like a thief in the night” and he encouraged his followers to have “steadfastness of hope” in the midst of crisis. The Book of Revelation speaks repeatedly about “patient endurance” and it calls for love and faith during times of persecution and oppression.

The Book of Daniel writes poetically of those who “will shine like the brightness of the sky” in the time after the apocalypse. Other apocalyptic texts, such as the Sibylline Oracles, describe poetically a coming light, a “life without care,” and a time when the “earth will belong equally to all.”

It is this quality of hope and endurance that might be most important for our own time.

They function in many important ways, but the most critical role they play in our society is protecting everyone from certain diseases. Without vaccines, our society would be in extreme danger, which is why getting vaccinated is extremely important. Although many people may believe that autism and vaccines are related, this correlation has been proven incorrect by many different studies and has been disproven by the government as well. It is important that we properly education everyone on the importance of vaccinations and how they benefit our society.

Five resources to help understand why it is important to be vaccinated:

Should You Get Vaccinated? (Link- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_6QW9sNPEY)

Description of Source: This video, written by Dwayne Godwin and Jorge Cham is a little insight into why vaccines are so important to the health of us as individuals, communities and the world. This video was created in 2013, but because it is a short video clip, all of the information in the video is still relevant and accurate today. This video is a very useful resource when trying to explain why everyone should get vaccinated. It uses language that even most children would understand. It also clearly states that although many people still believe this, vaccines do not cause autism.

Description of Source: This recent source is from CNN health and very clearly outlines the history of vaccines with a well organized timeline of events. Similar to the video above, this source also talks about how at one point it was thought that the MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccine was causing autism, but that claim has been rejected. The timeline goes on to show many recent outbreaks of measles which is fought via vaccine. The rise of measles is said to be from the lack of vaccinated individuals due to the anti-vaccination movement still going on today due to the unfounded claim that vaccines can lead to autism.

Deadly Choices: How the Anti-Vaccine Movement Threatens Us All

Description of Source: This book by Dr. Paul Offit, published in 2010, outlines the ongoing battle between parents that refuse to allow their children to get vaccinated and doctors that are scared for their patients because they aren’t vaccinated. Drr. Offit is an expert on infectious diseases. Due to the fact he is an expert on this topic, this book is extremely credible and worth the read for anyone that is interested in this topic or that is unaware of the dangers of not getting vaccinated.

Description of Source: The Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) is a very useful and informative site for anyone that has any question about a vaccine whether it be something as small as when to get your flu shot to the importance of getting vaccinated. Some interesting features of this site include a list of 1000 questions that are answered by experts on the topic of vaccinations and immunizations, the ability to submit your own individual question and so many resources on why vaccines are so important. This site is constantly updated with information from experts at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Vaccines and Autism: Evidence Does Not Support a Causal Association (Citation- DeStefano, F. (2007). Vaccines and autism: evidence does not support a causal association. Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 82(6), 756-759.)

Description of Source: This academic journal article by Frank DeStefan in 2007 is a very important and factually based article about the evidence against the causal relationship between vaccines and autism. This academic journal article has been cited by over 150 different academic journal articles, giving it an immense amount of credibility. Throughout the article, DeStefan also cites many other credible studies on the effects of MMR and thimerosal on neural cells. These studies showed that both of these vaccines, had no effect on the neural cells meaning these vaccines do not have the capability of causing autism."
317,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris as actors.",True,The article discusses President Trump's decision to temporarily suspend immigration to the United States.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing between U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir and Vice President Mike Pence at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 20, 2020.

President Donald Trump said Monday that he would temporarily suspend immigration to the United States because of the coronavirus pandemic, despite the US already being the worst-hit country in the world.

Trump referred to the ""Invisible Enemy,"" a phrase he has used to describe the virus that has killed more than 42,000 people in the US, which has more than 766,660 infections.

""In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!"" he tweeted Monday night.

The State Department issued around 462,000 immigrant visas in the 2019 fiscal year, while US Citizens and Immigration Services granted permanent residence to nearly 577,000 individuals.

Trump said the move would also protect American jobs, although the state-imposed lockdowns to slow the virus have already left 22 million people in the US out of work.

His tweet gave no further details about what the measure would entail, how it would be implemented or how long it would be in place.

Trump could sign an executive order as soon as Tuesday, The Washington Post reported, citing two White House officials.

The real estate tycoon campaigned for office on a platform of immigration skepticism and has made policies restricting immigration central to his presidency.

Criticising the ban, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris said Trump was using the coronavirus outbreak to push his anti-immigrant stance.

""Trump failed to take this crisis seriously from day 1,"" she tweeted.

""His abandonment of his role as president has cost lives. And now, he's shamelessly politicizing this pandemic to double down on his anti-immigrant agenda.""

Trump has touted his move to restrict travel from China over the coronavirus in January after it emerged there late last year, and he halted travel from much of Europe in mid-March as the virus spread there.

The president likely has the authority to restrict immigration to protect public health, Cato Institute researchers Alex Nowrasteh and Andrew C. Forrester said in a blog post.

""However, blanket bans like those imposed by the administration in recent months and those coming on April 21 are akin to closing the barn door after the horse has escaped,"" they wrote.

""Most research on travel bans in response to pandemics finds that they don't limit the spread of diseases, in part because they are always imposed after the disease has spread.""

Trump's tweet also implied that immigrants are spreading COVID-19 in the United States, they said.

However, examining the coronavirus date, ""the rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths by county in the United States is not correlated with the share of the population that is foreign-born.""

Trump has at times appeared impatient with efforts intended to slow the spread of the virus in the US -- appearing to lend support to protesters angry at governors' stay-at-home orders -- and has said parts of the country can begin to abandon lockdown measures soon.

He said Monday, however, that ""we've really done the right thing"" on fighting the virus, and that letting it spread unchecked would have been an ""atrocity.""

Trump has been widely criticized for initially downplaying the virus, which he likened to an ordinary flu and said was under control in the United States, before later accepting that it was a national emergency.

It was not immediately clear who would be affected by the latest immigration move as Washington has already suspended nearly all travel to the country.

The US last month suspended all routine visa services around the world -- including for immigrants -- due to the coronavirus pandemic, and has also imposed a series of travel bans.

The latest move is also likely to affect those hoping to apply for permanent resident ""green cards."""

The CDC confirmed 75 new cases of measles across the country last week. U.S. health officials blame the recent surge of cases — after saying in 2000 that the disease had been eliminated from the U.S. — to an increasing number of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.

Of the new cases last week, 66 were reported in New York state; of those, 41 were in New York City and 25 in nearby Rockland County. Public health officials have been battling two outbreaks since the fall. New York City is threatening to issue $1,000 fines to people who live in neighborhoods with the worst outbreaks and refuse to get their children vaccinated. City health officials have already issued citations to 84 people for refusing to comply with the order.

Measles is highly contagious yet preventable with a vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. More parents are refusing to vaccinate their children, sometimes based on false information that vaccines cause autism.

The disease spreads quickly and easily among people who aren't immunized, leaving communities with high rates of people who aren't protected particularly vulnerable.

Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat. It then causes a rash. Some people develop severe complications, such as pneumonia or brain swelling. Children younger than 5 and adults older than 20 are more likely to experience complications, the CDC says.

The disease is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people can pick up the disease while traveling and bring it back to the U.S., where they can spread it to other unvaccinated people."

David Petraeus apologized to Congress on Tuesday for sharing classified information with his biographer and mistress, Paula Broadwell. It was his first public testimony before lawmakers since resigning as CIA director.

Petraeus appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee, offering his recommendations for how the U.S. should address what he called a “revolutionary upheaval that is unparalleled in its modern history.”

 

 He said the progress achieved so far in fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq has been “inadequate” and suggested the U.S. increase support to Iraqi security forces and Sunni tribal and Kurdish fighters. In Syria, he recommended the U.S. take a harder stance against President Bashar Assad.



 He supported setting up enclaves protected by coalition airpower where moderate Sunnis could be supported, civilians could find refuge and additional forces could be trained. Later, he added that while it might not be necessary, he was “not at all opposed to seeing U.S. troops on the ground in an enclave” in an advise and assist role.

 

 “The Middle East is not part of the world that plays by Las Vegas rules: What happens in the Middle East is not going to stay in the Middle East,” he warned.

 

 Petraeus began his testimony, however, with an extraordinary apology for events stemming from his personal life. He was director of the CIA from September 2011 to November 2012, when he resigned after acknowledging an affair with Broadwell, a married U.S. Army reserve officer who met Petraeus while researching a book about his wartime leadership in Iraq and Afghanistan.

 

 “Four years ago, I made a serious mistake - one that brought discredit on me and pain to those closest to me,” Petraeus said. “It was a violation of the trust placed in me and a breach of the values to which I had been committed throughout my life.”

 

 “There is nothing I can do to undo what I did. I can only say again how sorry I am to those I let down and then strive to go forward with a greater sense of humility and purpose, and with gratitude to those who stood with me during a very difficult chapter in my life.”

 

 The retired four-star general was sentenced to two years of probation and fined $100,000 for unauthorized removal and retention of classified information he shared with Broadwell. Members of the committee welcomed Petraeus back to the congressional witness chair, praised his governmental service, did not mention the incident and limited their questions to Iraq, Syria and Iran.

 

 Before becoming CIA director, Petraeus commanded U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. On Iraq, Petraeus told the lawmakers that while there have been significant accomplishments in the fight against IS, “We are not where we should be at this point.”

 

 In addition to increasing support for local fighters, he suggested embedding U.S. advisers down to the brigade headquarters level for Iraqi fighting forces; exploring the use of air controllers with select Iraqi units to coordinate coalition airstrikes; and examining whether U.S. rules of military engagement for precision airstrikes are too restrictive.

 

 Petraeus said, however, that the U.S. should not allow its forces to take over Iraqi units. “I would not, for example, embed U.S. personnel at the Iraqi battalion level, nor would I support clearance operations before a viable force is available,” he said.

 

 He called Syria a “geopolitical Chernobyl - spewing instability and extremism over the region and the rest of the world.”

 

 “Like a nuclear disaster, the fallout from the meltdown of Syria threatens to be with us for decades, and the longer it is permitted to continue, the more severe the damage will be.”

 

 He said the U.S. is no closer today to having a moderate Sunni Arab ground force than a year ago.

 

 Last week, Gen. Lloyd Austin, commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees the war effort, told the committee that only a handful of U.S.-trained Syrian rebels are still on the battlefield fighting the militants. The four or five fighters still engaged in the campaign is astonishingly short of the U.S. goal to train and equip 5,400 rebels a year at a cost of $500 million.

 

 “The central problem in Syria is that Sunni Arabs will not be willing partners against the Islamic State unless we commit to protect them and the broader Syrian population against all enemies, not just ISIS,” Petraeus said using an acronym for the militant group. “That means protecting them from the unrestricted warfare being waged against them by Bashar Assad, especially by his air force and its use of barrel bombs.”

 

 He suggested that the U.S. tell Assad that if he continues to use barrel bombs, the U.S. will stop the Syrian air force from flying.

 

 “We have that capability,” he said. “It would demonstrate that the United States is willing to stand against Assad and it would show the Syrian people that we can do what the Islamic State cannot - provide them with a measure of protection.”

 

 At the same time, Petraeus warned against rushing to oust Assad without knowing who would fill the resulting political vacuum in the country."

As mentioned above, the characteristic chemical property of a metal atom is to lose one or more of its electrons to form a positive ion. However, certain metals lose electrons much more readily than others. In particular, cesium (Cs) can give up its valence electron more easily than can lithium (Li). In fact, for the alkali metals (the elements in Group 1), the ease of giving up an electron varies as follows: Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li with Cs the most likely, and Li the least likely, to lose an electron. In going down the group, the metals become more likely to lose an electron because the electron being removed lies increasingly farther from the positive nucleus. That is, the electron lost from Cs to form Cs+ lies at a much greater distance from the attractive positive nucleus—and is thus easier to remove—than the electron that must be removed from a lithium atom to form Li+. The same trend also is seen among the Group 2 elements (the alkaline-earth metals); the farther down in the group the metal resides, the more likely it is to lose an electron.

Just as metals vary somewhat in their properties, so do nonmetals. As a general rule, the most chemically active metals appear in the lower left-hand region of the periodic table, whereas the most chemically active nonmetals appear in the upper right-hand region. The properties of the semimetals, or metalloids, lie between those of the metals and the nonmetals.

The ionization energy of an element is the energy required to remove an electron from an individual atom. Here M(g) represents a metal in the vapour state.

Metal atoms lose electrons to nonmetal atoms because metals typically have relatively low ionization energies. Metals at the bottom of a group lose electrons more easily than those at the top. That is, ionization energies tend to decrease in going from the top to the bottom of a group. Nonmetals, which are found in the right-hand region of the periodic table, have relatively large ionization energies and therefore tend to gain electrons. Ionization energies generally increase in going from left to right across a given period. Thus, the elements that appear in the lower left-hand region of the periodic table have the lowest ionization energies (and are therefore the most chemically active metals), while the elements that occur in the upper right-hand region of the periodic table have the highest ionization energies (and are thus the most chemically active nonmetals).

As mentioned above, when a nonmetallic element reacts with a metallic element, electrons are transferred from the atoms of the metal to the atoms of the nonmetal, forming positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions), respectively. This produces an ionic compound. For example, lithium and fluorine (F) react to form lithium fluoride (LiF), which contains Li+ and F− ions.

In contrast, when two nonmetallic elements react, the atoms combine to form molecules by sharing electrons. Bonds formed by electron sharing between atoms are called covalent bonds. The electrons are shared rather than transferred, because the two nonmetal atoms have comparable attractive powers for the electrons in the bond. For example, fluorine gas consists of F molecules in which the fluorine atoms are bound together by sharing a pair of electrons, one contributed by each atom. In addition, hydrogen and fluorine react to form hydrogen fluoride, which contains HF molecules. The hydrogen and fluorine atoms are bound together by a pair of electrons, one electron contributed by the hydrogen atom and one by the fluorine atom. Although the electrons are shared between the hydrogen and the fluorine atoms, in this case they are not shared equally. This is clear from the fact that the HF molecule is polar; the hydrogen atom has a partial positive charge (δ+), while the fluorine atom has a partial negative charge (δ−): H―F

 δ+ δ− (In this example the symbol δ stands for a number less than one.) This electrical polarity occurs because the shared electrons spend more time close to the fluorine atom than to the hydrogen atom. That is, fluorine has greater affinity for the shared electrons than does hydrogen. This leads to a polar covalent bond.

The ability of an atom to attract the electrons shared with another atom is termed its electronegativity. The relative electronegativities of the various atoms can be determined by measuring the polarities of the bonds involving the atoms in question. Fluorine has the greatest electronegativity value (4.0, according to the Pauling scale), and cesium and francium have the smallest values (0.79 and 0.7, respectively). In general, nonmetal atoms have higher electronegativities than metal atoms. In the periodic table, electronegativity typically increases in moving across a period and decreases in going down a group. When elements with very different electronegativities (such as fluorine and cesium) react, one or more electrons are transferred to form an ionic compound. For example, cesium and fluorine react to form CsF, which contains Cs+ and F− ions. When nonmetal atoms with differing electronegativities react, they form molecules with polar covalent bonds.

Another important atomic property is atomic size. The sizes of atoms vary; atoms generally tend to become larger in going down a group on the periodic table and smaller in going from left to right across a period."

• Vice President Pence announced that there are now enough tests for states that are prepared to enter the first phase of reopening.
• Dr. Anthony Fauci said testing for infection would need to be essentially instant.

President Trump reiterated Friday that he's leaving coronavirus testing to governors, one day after he announced guidelines for states to begin reopening their economies, ""The governors are responsible for testing,"" the president said Friday. The guidelines issued Thursday came as several regional coalitions of states said they would coordinate easing restrictions.

Vice President Pence also announced Friday that there are now enough tests for states that are prepared to enter the first phase of reopening, although the Trump administration doesn't have clear figures on how many tests are needed moving forward.

""Our best scientists and health experts say we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of a Phase 1 opening,"" Pence told reporters at the task force briefing. The president said the federal government would be sending out 5.5 million swabs to states in the week ahead. By Friday, the president said the U.S had conducted 3.78 million tests. Delays in processing testing have slowed the testing system.

Mr. Trump's guidelines on reopening the country relies heavily on governors, states and businesses, according to the White House ""Opening Up America Again"" document. The plan is expected to put much of the onus on states to develop sufficient testing and contact tracing systems.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's leading infectious diseases expect, said testing for infection would need to be essentially instant, and frequent, to guarantee with certainty that someone isn't currently infected, which is why antibody testing and tracing will be important. But while testing for coronavirus is a key piece of tackling the virus, Fauci warned it's just one piece of it.

""The emphasis we've been hearing is that testing is everything and it isn't,"" Fauci said. However, he also suggested there would be ""enough tests to allow us to take this country safely to Phase 1.""

During Thursday's task force briefing, the president said a handful of states that have already meet the criteria could begin the new guidelines ""literally tomorrow."" States will be very ""vigilant"" and very ""careful,"" he said. Fauci on Thursday said the plan is not a ""light switch,"" and changes will be gradual. The ""dominating drive"" of this plan was to make sure it is done in the safest way possible, he said.

Earlier Friday, the president tweeted ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN,"" ""LIBERATE MINNESOTA,"" AND ""LIBERATE VIRGINIA,"" seeming to support protests of stay-at-home orders in which protesters were pictured violating the Centers for Disease Control's six-feet social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines. Asked if he thinks the protesters might be endangering others by failing to follow social distancing guidelines, the president dismissed the risks.

""No these are people expressing their views,"" the president said Friday evening. ""...They seem to be very responsible people to me. But they've been treated a little bit rough.""

Mr. Trump suggested he wants to hold his own gatherings in the not-so-distant future. The president said he expects campaign rallies to resume at some point before November, and that they will be bigger than ever. Experts don't expect a vaccine to be available before next year.

The president also announced Friday the federal government will be providing $19 billion in funding for farmers and ranchers, including $16 billion in direct payments and $3 billion will go towards purchasing food from farmers for food banks."

Rand Paul as the actor who blocked the bill to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.,True,The article discusses Sen. Rand Paul's action of blocking the bill to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.,False,There is no mention of a threat in this article.,False,There is no mention of a pattern in this article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in this article.,"On Wednesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) blocked an effort to unanimously pass a bill to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. Jon Stewart was not happy.

“Pardon me if I’m not impressed in any way by Rand Paul’s fiscal responsibility virtue signaling,” a visibly disgusted Stewart told Bret Baier on Fox News Wednesday night. “Rand Paul presented tissue paper avoidance of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that added hundreds of billions of dollars to our deficit, and now he stands up at the last minute, after 15 years of blood, sweat, and tears from the 9/11 community to say that it’s all over now and now we’re going to balance the budget on the backs of the 9/11 first responder community.”

The former Daily Show host has long pressured Congress to reauthorize the fund, which offers compensation to 9/11 survivors and first responders who have filed claims relating to various health problems they have experienced as a result of the attacks, and is set to expire in 2020. Last month, he delivered an emotional appeal to the House Judiciary Committee to deliver an emotional appeal to the House Judiciary Committee. “They responded in five seconds,” he said of the first responders, a group of which accompanied Stewart to Capitol Hill. “They did their jobs, with courage, grace, tenacity, humility. Eighteen years later — do yours!”

The House of Representatives passed the bill to reauthorize the fund last week. It’s expected to eventually pass in the Senate, as well, but it will take an additional bit of maneuvering thanks to Paul’s objection on Wednesday.

Paul says he wants the aid funding for the victims to be offset with cuts in spending elsewhere. But the senator, as Stewart noted, did not apply his balanced-budget requirement when he voted to support tax cuts — disproportionately for corporations and the wealthy — that are projected to add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade.

“This is about what kind of society we want to have,” Stewart told Baier on Wednesday. “At some point we have to stand up for the people who have always stood up for us, and who at this moment in time maybe cannot stand up for themselves due to their illnesses and their injuries. What Rand Paul did today in the Senate is outrageous.”"

It depends whom you ask, and different partisan groups are answering the question differently.

Predictably, Democrats give more credit to President Obama, while Republicans prefer to credit his predecessor, former President George W. Bush.

Only one major polling agency has asked about credit for the kill: the Pew Research Center, which surveyed 654 U.S. adults by phone on Monday night, the day after Navy SEALs raided bin Laden's compound in Pakistan. The poll found a nine-percent approval bounce for the president.

Pew has sent over its full partisan breakdown, explaining how self-identified Republicans, Democrats, and Independents assign credit for the kill. Here are some rudimentary Excel charts expressing those results:

It's questionable how strongly we should rely on an overnight poll the day after a major news event, but, so far, this is the only indication we have.

Obama received 35 percent more ""great deal"" responses from Democrats than Republicans; Bush received 27 percent more ""great deal"" responses from Republicans than Democrats.

Interestingly enough, the partisanship of Obama's approval bounce is also up for debate. Pew found that Obama's standing did not increase, at all, in the eyes of Republicans; a CBS poll released Wednesday found a 15-percent bounce among Republicans since April 20 (up from a nine percent approval rating to 24 percent)."

The Director's defenders, at least, are outraged. ""When the lion dies, the rats come out,"" sneers Efrem Zimbalist Jr., longtime star of the once top-rated television series The FBI. Insists William Ruckelshaus, one of the victims of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre: ""Really, the man had only one motive. That was to make the FBI the finest investigative agency in the world.""

Certainly the post-Watergate morality casts a harsher light on official conduct that once was not questioned. In the cold war period, the Communist threat from abroad, if not at home, did lookand wasdangerous. Such FBI-infiltrated groups as the Ku Klux Klan and the Weatherman did proclaim violence.

Throughout much of his career, Hoover used information compiled by his agents to build political support for the bureau. TIME has learned, for example, that Hoover went to one Senator with the revelation that his daughter was using hard drugs. Hoover agreed to keep the matter quietand thereby earned the Senator's lasting gratitude. Similarly, when Hoover discovered that one Congressman was a homosexual, he visited the legislator to assure him that this news would never leak from the FBIand thus made a new friend for the bureau.

The Director's dealings with Presidents, as detailed two weeks ago by a Senate committee report (TIME, Dec. 15), were just as self-serving. Clearly the worst offender in demanding political information from Hoover was President Lyndon Johnson. Both men loved gossip and this type of intrigue. Hoover ingratiated himself with L.B.J. during the Justice Department's investigation of Johnson's congressional protégé and crony, Bobby Baker. Asked by Attorney General Robert Kennedy to ""wire"" someone to talk to a Baker friend, Hoover not only refused but reported the request to Johnson. The Justice Department lawyers went to Treasury agents instead and got the help they sought. That infuriated Johnson, who asked Hoover to check out Treasury for the men who helped Kennedy.

Always worried about Kennedy supporters in his midst, Johnson kept asking Hoover to investigate White House personnel. TIME has learned that Presidential Speechwriter Richard Goodwin resigned as the result of one such probe. Johnson also ordered FBI name checks on high officials in the Democratic National Committee for the same purpose. L.B.J. was so phobic about the Kennedys that when the Washington Star attacked him editorially, he asked Hoover to find out if there was any Kennedy money behind the paper. Since the FBI also had its own ""enemies list"" of newspapers critical of Hoover, the Director was sympathetic to such appeals.

Moreover, when Johnson's aide, Walter Jenkins, was involved in a homosexual episode in 1964, L.B.J. suspected that a Barry Goldwater supporter may have set up the arrest. He angrily ordered Hoover to seek derogatory material on Goldwater's Senate staff to be held for use if the Senator made an issue of the Jenkins matter in the presidential campaign. Goldwater never did so."

A lack of public education, access to vaccines, training and ""perhaps most importantly, lack of political will for a national immunization schedule,"" are largely to blame, history professor and the study's co-author Heather MacDougall said.

MacDougall and co-author Laurence Monnais of Univeristé​ de Montré​al analyzed data on the measles vaccine from the mid-1960s to 1998. 1998 was the year the Lancet published the debunked report from Andrew Wakefield that linked the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism.

Their article, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, found ""vaccine hesitancy"" started before the 1990s.

""Vaccination hesitancy has always been an issue, actually, since the beginning of vaccination,"" Monnais said in a CMAJ podcast about their report.

The researchers noted in 1962, the thalidomide disaster, combined with new styles of parenting led to the popularization of alternative medicine.

There were measles outbreaks in the 1970s and 1980s, which happened at the same time there was a shift in how people thought about their health.

In the CMAJ podcast, MacDougall said the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1972, but people began questioning its effectiveness almost immediately.

Also in the 1970s and 1980s, researchers said, people stopped thinking about their health in terms of how it impacted society as a whole and saw it more as an individual issue.

As women entered the workforce, they turned less to their parents and doctors for advice and became more dependent on parenting guides, MacDougall said.

""There's a huge upsurge in parenting guides during the 1970s and 1980s. There was so much advice and there was so much pressure on them to be good or perfect mothers,"" MacDougall said.

That has only intensified over the years, she said.

""The internet today is a huge source of excessive pressure on young mothers, particularly, although young men are equally pressured in a way that parents in the past weren't,"" MacDougall said.

By the 1990s, young parents became more willing to question whether they should vaccinate their child.

The researchers said the division of healthcare between the federal and provincial and territorial governments has meant there's no consensus on a national immunization program.

It took many years for federal government to create a national immunization strategy in 2003, MacDougall said.

""Unfortunately, [the government] hasn't subsequently provided consistent funding or leadership"" for that strategy in the years since, she said.

As well, there has been a lack of ""sustained training"" in immunology, and healthcare practitioners have limited knowledge to provide guidance to parents and patients.

""The real problem, I think, is that current healthcare professionals have probably never seen an actual case of measles unless they trained overseas and are very much products of current society,"" MacDougall said.

She said they hope their article ""will create questions in people's minds about the history of vaccine policy in Canada and that it will lead to some understanding that it's more complex than simply manufacturing and administering vaccines."""

Notes will be disinfected with X-rays or high temperatures before being put aside in a safe for 7 to 14 days, explained Fan Yifei, the vice-governor of the Chinese central bank.

The quarantine period of bank notes will depend on the seriousness of the crisis in each region, Fan Yifei said.

After their quarantined period is over, the bank notes will be circulated again.

""We must protect the security and the health of cash users"", Fan Yifei said, adding that bank notes exchanges between Chiense provinces are suspended for now.

This decision follows a rise in Chinese people's reluctance to use cash for fear of the virus.

Fan Yifei said China's central bank would go on with its ""prudent"" monetary policy, despite some analysts saying the country could ease it to revive its economy, which had dwindled because of the epidemic.

In the recording of Obama's half hour web call with the Obama Alumni Association, he asserted that Trump's response to the Covid-19 crisis had been an “absolute chaotic disaster”.

But Trump hit back at the claims about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak which has so far killed nearly 80,000 Americans.

He tweeted: “We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic, especially the very early BAN of people from China, the infectious source, entering the USA.

“Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls - didn't have a clue!”

About one year after Obama took office, the H1N1 pandemic hit the U.S. – and in October 2009 he declared the outbreak a national emergency.

Audio of the web call where Obama made the comments was obtained by Yahoo News, who then released a report of the details of the call Friday.

Obama said: “What we're fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy - that has become a stronger impulse in American life.

“And by the way, we're seeing that internationally as well.

“It's part of the reason why the response to this global crisis has been so anemic and spotty.

“It would have been bad even with the best of governments,' he claimed.

'It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset — of 'what's in it for me' and 'to heck with everybody else' — when that mindset is operationalized in our government.”

Not only did Trump unleash his fury via Twitter, but he also lashed out during Monday's press briefing in the White House Rose Garden.

He was asked by a reporter about a string of tweets he sent on Sunday, including one which read: ""OBAMAGATE makes Watergate look small time!""

""You appeared to accuse President Obama of the biggest political crime in American history by far. What crime exactly are you accusing President Obama of committing?"" the journalist asked.

""Obamagate,"" Trump simply replied. ""It's been going for a long time, it's been going on from before I even got elected and it's a disgrace that it happened.""

However Trump never specified what Obamagate entailed.

The reporter pressed him, and asked again: ""What is the crime exactly that you are accusing him of?""

""You know what the crime is,"" Trump said, declining to answer directly. ""The crime is obvious to everybody.""

Back over on Twitter, Trump also blasted Obama and linked him to the much-criticized handling of the now-dropped Michael Flynn case, dubbing it “Obamagate”.

Last week, Attorney General William Barr’s Justice Department dismissed the case against Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, which was seen as the key prosecution from Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in Trump's 2016 election campaign.

Trump, along with other Republicans, claim the decision as an example of a Democrat-manufactured plot to remove him from office.

Several of Trump's tweets also accused Obama of knowing the details of a call between former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and Russian diplomat Sergey Kislyak in 2016 — at the centre of what Trump calls the “Impeachment Scam”.

In response, Trump retweeted Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) who said: “Obama's FBI targeted President Trump and his allies before the 2016 election. Scary!”

He added: “...And we caught them and their illegal activities!”

Trump was also keen to highlight how his administration had dealt with Beijing compared to Obama's cosy relationship with President Xi Jinping which had “allowed China 'to grow to the dominant dictatorship superpower that it is”.

That’s not in the cards anytime soon.

After states began to reopen their economies in May, more people went back to work, consumer spending increased and Americans grew more confident that the worst of a coronavirus-induced recession was over.

Read: Consumer sentiment climbs again in June as reopening U.S. economy eases worries

More good news is on the way.

Retail sales are expected to rebound smartly in May from a record 16.4% drop in April. Wall Street economists forecast a 5.4% snapback when the report is released next Tuesday. Another gauge of industrial production the same day is also likely to show a rebound.

The rebound comes as no surprise. There’s a lot of pentup demand from consumers and businesses after a few months of the economy being almost entirely locked down. Now that businesses are reopening and people are moving about more, they can spend some of the money they had been involuntarily forced to save.

“The opening of more businesses — especially retail stores and restaurants — will prompt more consumers’ to open their wallets as they unleash a wave of pent-up demand that has been building in some parts of the country since mid-March,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist of Bank of the West.

Higher retail sales alone, however, can be misleading. What matters even more is what consumers are buying or spending their money on.

Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said a more telling tale about the strength of a nascent recovery is how much people spend on “the wants and not the needs.”

Examples: Dining out or takeout, home furnishings and hobby items such as books, music or sporting goods.

“People want to go out,” she noted. “That speaks volumes about consumer confidence.”

Yet what happens after the pentup demand is met?

“A lot depends on how things progress from here,” said senior economist Sam Bullard of Wells Fargo, referring to efforts to contain the coronavirus and find treatments. The federal government’s willingness to keep providing benefits to millions Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic is also critical.

Bullard also pointed to the substantial amount of forced savings as another pool of money from which households can draw. Families have spent more on food, but they’ve hardly spent anything on clothes, gas, transportation, haircuts and other goods and services they normally would have purchased during the lockdown.

Read: Consumer prices drop again as pandemic cuts rate of inflation to near zero

Yet the economy can’t avoid another slump if spending drops off again. Companies won’t bring back more workers if the demand isn’t there, and fewer people returning to their jobs would eventually depress sales again.

That’s where the government comes in. Washington’s effort to help families out with bonus checks and more generous unemployment benefits has played a key role in restarting the economy. If the federal government pulls back too soon, however, it could endanger a fragile recovery.

“We are still at the beginning,” Lee said. “We are at the start line.”"
334,True,The article discusses conspiracy theories related to Tom Hanks being accused of pedophilia and the QAnon conspiracy.,True,The article mentions Tom Hanks as the accused actor and the QAnon conspiracy as the group embracing the allegations.,True,The article discusses the actions of the accuser posting reconstructed memories on Twitter and the QAnon conspiracy spreading the allegations.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article discusses the pattern of accusing high-profile individuals of pedophilia and the historical use of pedophilia accusations in propaganda.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Almost a year ago, a woman accused Tom Hanks of sexually abusing her as a child and began posting reconstructed memories on Twitter. The accounts are disturbing and specific, but incomplete and unproven—something Hanks’ accuser attributes to the trauma-based mind control she believes herself a victim of. Even though (or perhaps, because) her claims remain unverified, the pedophilia allegations were quickly embraced by a group known for up-leveling whisperings of child abuse into full-blown scandal: devotees of the QAnon conspiracy.

Believers in the QAnon conspiracy hold that President Trump is a “brilliant four-dimensional chess player” using the Mueller investigation as a smokescreen to root out the murderous, Satanic, pedophilic deep state. (It’s a Trump-era catchall conspiracy: Pizzagate + Seth Rich + the Illuminati.) Hanks is the QAnon conspiracists' perfect target: A Hollywood A-lister who donates to Democrats and has been shielded from moral censure by monogamy and his preternaturally wholesome dad routine—until now. And QAnon has done what they do best: Trumpet the unconfirmed revelation until suddenly, in the eyes of internet search algorithms at least, Tom Hanks, America’s uncomplicated, unproblematic favorite, is a pedophile.

Cooler heads will remember that Hanks is innocent until proven guilty, and there is scant proof to work with here; yet, somewhere a conspiracy theorist is very pleased that you’re suddenly, automatically feeling a little suspicious. All the debunkings in the world won’t extinguish that initial spark of suspicion, and that’s exactly the point.

Hanks is only the most recent protagonist in a spate of high-profile pedophilia accusations levied by far-right commentators. Many, like Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn’s, have been championed by the same citizen sleuths who powered Pizzagate, the unfounded theory that Clinton-linked DC elites ran a child sex-trafficking ring out of a pizzeria. But while crying ""pedophile"" is a trollish smear many now associate with the digital wing of the American extreme right, the tactic isn’t native to a particular ideology, and long, long predates the internet.

Alleging that your enemy preys upon children is an ancient propaganda tool that’s been used by everyone from medieval Catholics to the Soviet Union. It’s a powerful indictment because it trades on fundamental human fears. It’s designed to otherize the opposition and sabotage any sympathy you might have for them. It’s a ubiquitous tactic because it works.

It’s easy to piece together how this strategy emerged: Someone figured out which crime their society viewed as most morally reprehensible and went with that—the unforgivable act that almost always involves kids. “Children represent the most sacred ideals any society can have,” says Margaret Peacock, a historian at the University of Alabama who has written about the role children play in propaganda. “They represent the future.” Because humans are biologically wired to protect their offspring, painting your enemy as a defiler of innocence and a threat to the next generation instantly dehumanizes them. And because many societies see pedophiles as not just monstrous but irredeemably so, this charge provides endless opportunities to justify mistreating the group accused of it.

Establishing your opposition as a subhuman beast has been justification for the harshest forms of retaliation. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, European Jews were accused of kidnapping Christian children to use their blood in religious rituals; Also throughout the 19th and mid-20th centuries, European Jews were the victims of pogroms and the Holocaust. Where false pedophilia charges go, genocide and repression follow. (A related strategy: Far-right commentators such as Ann Coulter have accused refugees of preying upon children as a way to justify not aiding these groups as they flee deadly, oppressive situations.)

Barely a decade later, the threat of child predation helped rationalize the Cold War, on both sides. The Soviet Union condemned capitalism by suggesting that the US was so reluctant to use social services that its children were forced into lives of crime and prostitution. Over in the US, communism was the real thief of childhood, transforming children into brainwashed robots capable of turning their own parents over to the state for crimes such as hoarding grain. There’s likely some truth to these tales on either side, which is why propagandists chose them: Keeping the focus on mistreated children keeps people from wondering about whether they’re wholly true. The anger stirred by these stories helped keep millions and millions of people on the brink of nuclear destruction because the consequences of allowing the other side to remain unchecked was unthinkable.

In the US, the marches of the civil rights movement occurred alongside a steady drip of propaganda painting black men as a sexual threat to white women and children. “It was as a tool for the othering of the black man, excusing brutal suppression and surveillance,” Peacock says. “It’s arguably helped lead to the rise of the police state they’ve come to live in today.” For the same reason, attempts to criminalize homosexuality (or block marriage equality) have also come along with accusations of pedophilia. Proving these suspicions would require elevated levels of domestic surveillance—unwarranted searches, wiretaps—but stoking fears to produce hate has a way of prompting people to let civil rights slide."

Now Thermo Fisher’s goal is 10 million per week. Shortages of supplies needed to make or interpret the tests have eased. Looking ahead to the fall, the company expects new arenas for its testing will create new demand. Businesses have begun to test — and retest — their returning employees.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 1.3 percent. Australian stocks dropped 1.74 percent, while shares in China fell 0.67 percent.

Oil futures slumped for a second consecutive trading session due to worries about weak global energy demand, which weighed on the currencies of oil producers and countries that rely on exporting commodities.

The Chinese yuan headed for its biggest daily decline in two weeks, underscoring the risk-averse mood.

The three major US stock indexes fell more than 5 percent on Thursday, posting their worst day since mid-March, when markets were shocked by the abrupt economic lockdowns imposed to contain the pandemic.

""All of a sudden the coronavirus, which has been an also-ran story for some days now, became more important as the virus began picking up in some (US) states, and the market began thinking there may be delays to reopening,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

US stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis, rose 1.1 percent in Asia on Friday, but that did little to help sentiment.

Japan's Nikkei stock index slid 1.22 percent, and shares in South Korea fell 2.24 percent as some investors booked profits from a recent rally in global equities.

Coronavirus cases have jumped in several US states in recent days, raising concern among experts who say authorities have loosened restrictions put in place to contain the spread too early.

Cases in New Mexico, Utah and Arizona rose by 40 percent for the week ending Sunday, a Reuters tally showed. Florida and Arkansas are other hot spots.

The US Federal Reserve released a gloomy economic outlook at the end of its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Chairman Jerome Powell warned of a ""long road"" to recovery.

Economic data appeared to back up the Fed's projections, with jobless claims still more than double their peak during the Great Recession and continuing claims at an astoundingly high 20.9 million.

US crude slid 1.87 percent to $35.66 a barrel, while Brent crude eased 1.43 percent to $38.00 per barrel in Asia on Friday hit by renewed concerns over demand and a large buildup of US crude inventories.

The Mexican peso and the Norwegian krone both fell against the US dollar as the decline in crude prices hurt currencies from oil-producing countries.

Commodity-linked currencies, the Australian and New Zealand dollars, snapped a three-week run of sharp gains.

In the onshore market, the yuan fell 0.3 percent, headed for its biggest daily decline since May 27.

The 10-year US Treasury yield edged up slightly to 0.6853 percent on Friday.

Bond prices were well supported after they rallied following the Fed's commitment on Wednesday to years of extraordinary support to counter the economic fallout from the pandemic."

But when it comes to dealing with the Sept. 11 attacks, the most noteworthy debate is the one going on among people on the left and other people on the left.

In that discussion, some commentators have shown a firm grasp of reality and unapologetic patriotism. Others, however, have been striving mightily to make themselves into national laughingstocks.

There are plenty of conservatives, of course, who have used the opportunity to permanently disqualify themselves from ever being taken seriously again--including Ann Coulter, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. But for sheer volume of imbecility, it's hard to outdo the blame-America-first crowd of mindless peaceniks and twitchy conspiracy theorists. The New Republic, a moderately liberal political weekly, has been running a regular feature called ""Idiocy Watch,"" highlighting particularly lamebrained comments, and the forum has so far been dominated by lefties.

In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorism, writer Susan Sontag found herself barraged with criticism for decrying the ""self-righteous drivel and outright deception being peddled by public figures and TV commentators,"" while assailing our ""cowardly"" approach to war.

Weeks later, her bout of temporary insanity is beginning to look permanent. ""I don't like throwing biscuits and peanut butter and jam and napkins, little snack packages produced in a small city in Texas, so we can say, `Look, we're doing something humanitarian,' "" sneers Sontag in an interview with the online magazine Salon. She fears that the government is about to deport all Muslims and declare martial law, which is about as likely as Susan Sontag being appointed secretary of defense.

Humorist Michael Moore, who made the anti-capitalist movie ""Roger & Me,"" finds reasons to yuk it up. ""Finally, the bombs are raining down on Afghanistan, and as Martha Stewart says, that's a good thing,"" he brays on his Web site. ""Yesiree, I say, BOMBS AWAY! Rockets red glare. We are all WHITE WITH FOAM!"" I don't know about you, but I laughed till my ribs hurt.

Professional moviemaker and amateur paranoid Oliver Stone saw the terrorist attacks as the fault of the Republican Party. ""Does anybody make a connection between the 2000 election and the events of Sept. 11?"" he asked at a recent panel discussion in New York, which I take to mean that the terrorists were bitter that Al Gore didn't win.

Stone searched hard and found something good to say about Osama bin Laden and Co.: ""The new world order is about order and control. This attack was pure chaos, and chaos is energy. All great changes have come from people or events that were initially misunderstood, and seemed frightening, like madmen.""

Does it seem odd to you that Oliver Stone would feel affinity with madmen? Me neither.

Fortunately, you can find plenty of left-of-center commentators who prefer their country and its ideals over those of the enemy. At the New York forum, writer Christopher Hitchens lambasted Stone as a ""moral idiot, as well as an intellectual idiot."" The attack, he said, was ""state-supported mass murder, using civilians as missiles.""

The Nation magazine, perhaps the best-known organ of leftist thought, published a column by Katha Pollitt on why she refused to let her daughter decorate their living-room window with an American flag--which Mom regards as a symbol of ""jingoism and vengeance and war."" (The daughter retorts that the flag ""means standing together and honoring the dead and saying no to terrorism."" Where does she get such ideas?)

But many other Nation contributors have taken a sharply different view from Pollitt's. Writing in the latest issue, Princeton professor Richard Falk agrees with those who fault the U.S. as an imperialist power, but says that critique is ""dangerously inappropriate in addressing the challenge posed by the massive crime against humanity committed on Sept. 11."" The American role in world affairs, he argues, ""cannot be addressed so long as this movement of global terrorism is at large and prepared to carry on with its demonic work.""

Nation columnist Eric Alterman has no charity toward those who feel no patriotism at a time like this. Some of them, he says, ""really do hate their country. These leftists find nothing to admire in its magnificent Constitution; its fitful history of struggle toward greater freedom for women, minorities and other historically oppressed groups; and its values, however imperfectly or hypocritically manifested in everyday life."" For Alterman, ""patriotism requires no apologies.""

Those who feel differently--who can't take their own country's side when it is under attack by murderous foreign theocrats--should find themselves disgraced and ignored long after this struggle is over. In wartime, as leftists like Alterman understand, stupidity is not forgivable."
338,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,Kanye West is explicitly mentioned as the actor in the article.,True,Kanye West criticizes Obama's Presidential record and promises to build new homes in Chicago.,False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,False,There is no mention of a pattern in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"Kanye West has appeared to criticise Obama’s Presidential record on Twitter, claiming that “nothing changed” in his home city of Chicago during the former US President’s eight years in office.

The rapper – who has been praising Trump on the social media platform in recent days – was famously called a “jackass” by then-President Obama in 2009 following the Taylor Swift controversy at the MTV VMAs. Obama later added in 2012 that while West was indeed “a jackass”, he was also “smart” and “very talented”.

On Wednesday (April 25), Kanye tweeted: “Obama was in office for eight years and nothing in Chicago changed.” He also promised to “build new homes in Chicago” with Chance The Rapper.

Chance, meanwhile, spoke out to offer his support to West in a series of tweets, saying that Kanye was “in a great space and not affected by folk tryna question his mental or physical health”.

“Black people don’t have to be democrats,” Chance added. “Next President gon be independent”.

Also yesterday (April 25), Kanye referred to Trump on Twitter as “my brother”, and said that the two share “dragon energy”.

After appearing to clarify that he does indeed “love” Trump, Kanye then said that he also “loved” the President’s opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton, and that he wasn’t “a Democrat or a Republican”.

Following that string of tweets, West then revealed that his wife, Kim Kardashian West, had called him after reading his posts and wanted him to publicly state that he doesn’t “agree with everything Trump does”.

Two hours after posting that message, Kanye uploaded a selfie of himself – along with Universal Music Group Chairman/CEO Sir Lucian Grainge and YouTube’s Global Head of Music Lyor Cohen – wearing an infamous ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.

That tweet provoked a strong response from many of his followers who slammed Kanye for wearing the Trump-affiliated hat – which the President had, of course, signed for him.

Shortly after these pictures were uploaded, Trump registered his approval for West’s recent Twitter activity by writing “Thank you Kanye, very cool!”

The artist has also spoken further today on his apparent ambition to run for US President in 2024 – although Kardashian later tweeted: “Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion, and we know that, and that’s why I love him and respect him, and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing, but they aren’t labeled the way he is, and you will all praise them!

“Kanye is years ahead of his time,” she added.

West’s new album is expected in June and will be the follow-up to 2016’s ‘The Life Of Pablo’. Here’s everything we know about the release so far."
339,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions banks, including Societe Generale, as actors responsible for the problems in the banking industry.",True,"The article discusses the actions of banks, such as facing a funding crunch and having credit lines pulled.",True,The article mentions the potential collapse of banks and the need for radical action to resolve the banking crisis.,False,The article does not discuss patterns or connect events.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Last week, it was the turn of France's major banks, in particular Societe Generale, to feel the white heat of investor fears as its share price performed the sort of manoeuvres that are normally the preserve of penny stocks.

The reasons given for the, at times, 20pc falls in the Soc Gen share price varied. One moment it was the potential victim of downgrade in French government bonds, next there were hidden equity derivative trading losses, at other times it was facing a funding crunch and had its credit lines pulled.

Underlying it all was the sense that Soc Gen and banks in general have not been upfront about the problems they face and are playing a trillion pound game of chicken with investors, creditors and central banks.

That markets may feel banks have not been entirely truthful is understandable. Over a period of 12 months from early 2008 into 2009 a series of banks, brokers and mutuals collapsed or were nationalised often only weeks, days or hours after insisting they had no problems whatsoever.

Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fortis, Royal Bank of Scotland and many others had said they were fine, until they were not, often leaving customers and investors sitting on huge losses.

Indeed, any fund that withdrew its custom and shorted the banks' shares the moment a chief executive appeared on a conference call to say all was well would not only have avoided large losses, but made a lot of money too.

The lessons were learned: suspect everything a bank says, and never be the last one out the door.

Banks and regulators are alive to the problem and the industry stress tests run by the European Banking Authority have attempted to counter the suspicions.

Unfortunately, they appear to have failed. Detailed breakdowns of government bond exposures and a raft of other information on their risks have not comforted investors who now want more details of how banks are funded.

It is in the banking industry's interests to provide this disclosure, but as before with the issue of sovereign debt, banks are not being as forthcoming as they might.

While bankers will cry ""commercial sensitivity"", investors will think the worst. You only need to look at European bank credit default swaps, essentially insurance against their collapse.

In some cases, the CDS on financial institutions is trading at higher levels than at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008 and for most banks they are continuing to widen.

CDS is not an exact proxy for a bank's borrowing costs, but it is fair to assume the cost of funding is rising for many, indeed, Bank of Ireland, the only Irish bank not to be nationalised, returned to loss in the first half largely because of a sharp rise in its financing costs.

This situation will only get worse if it is not addressed swiftly. Already a host of peripheral eurozone savings banks have effectively become wards of the European Central Bank and more than 50pc of excess deposits within the currency union – a higher proportion than after Lehman Brothers collapsed – are being recycled daily to prop up weaker banks that have been shut out of the interbank market.

Like the sovereign debt crisis, of which it is an ancillary, the developing European banking crisis can only begin to be resolved if banks and regulators are upfront about the problems the sector faces and are prepared to take radical action to deal with them.

This could mean the creation of fewer, but larger Europe-wide banks that have the financial strength to convince the markets they are a good long-term bet. The adjunct of this is that many smaller lenders will close through merger or simply be run down.

It is possible, as Standard & Poor's analysts pointed out last week, that some smaller European countries may end up with no domestic banks.

This may be unfortunate for them, but it may be the price that has to be paid for a banking system that can survive in the new world order."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

Billy Graham became known as ""America’s pastor"" by refusing to pick a political side while reaching out to other religious leaders and invoking “the Lord” rather than Jesus.

But his son, the Rev. Franklin Graham, isn’t practicing what his father preached.

While the elder Graham, who died Wednesday at age 99, prayed with Democratic and Republican presidents, Franklin Graham has aligned himself with archconservative Republicans and is squarely in President Donald Trump’s corner.

Franklin Graham even took a page from Trump and coyly questioned whether President Barack Obama was Christian, although he later apologized for doing so.

Billy Graham largely left the culture wars to combative conservative evangelicals like James Dobson, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, but his son has not hesitated to level threats of hell fire against gay people, tarring them as sinners and followers of Satan.

Both Grahams opposed homosexuality, but while Billy Graham was apologetic after he suggested in 1993 that AIDS was ""a judgment of God"" and afterward largely steered clear of the subject, Franklin has not held his tongue.

Billy Graham was, for the most part, respectful of other religions — although he did face criticism in 1994 after he was quoted in the posthumously published diaries of H.R. Haldeman, President Richard Nixon's chief of staff, as having said in 1972 that ""satanic Jews"" dominated the news media. After first denying the quotes, Graham apologized in 2002 when audio of them surfaced, and said his remarks did ""not reflect my love for the Jewish people.""

His son, meanwhile, has flat out called Islam “evil and very wicked.""

“He was a remarkable reassuring pastoral presence,” Jon Meacham, a presidential historian and an MSNBC contributor, said of Billy Graham. “He was an evangelical but not a fundamentalist.”

To other experts, what Franklin Graham represents is a return to the harsher old time religion that his father did not push, one that excludes non-Christians and insisted that salvation is only for those who accept Jesus as their savior.

“Billy Graham made a conscious decision early in his career to forsake the narrow and constrictive fundamentalism of his childhood,” said Randall Balmer, who chairs the religion department at Dartmouth. “I think Franklin Graham has done the opposite. He has chosen to be a fundamentalist and with a militancy that his father never displayed.”

Franklin Graham, as a young man, rebelled against his father before returning to the fold, Balmer noted.

“I think people who do that kind of thing tend to be more conservative and more willing to impose strictures on both themselves and on others,” Balmer said.

Also, Franklin Graham’s ascent coincided with the rise of the ""Moral Majority"" and the migration of evangelicals from the Democratic Party to the GOP.

“His father actually warned against the politicization of evangelicals,” Balmer said. “But Franklin has jumped in feet first.”

Barry Hankins, a history professor and an expert on the evangelical movement at Baylor University, in Waco, Texas, said, “Billy Graham in the 1950s made a deliberate move away from the fighting evangelicalism and was denounced by some fundamentalists for doing so.”

Franklin Graham has chosen to do the opposite, Hankins said.

“For me, as a moderate evangelical, it’s disheartening to see and hear Franklin Graham doing and saying some of things he has,” Hankins said. “It’s certainly not in the spirit of his father.”

Franklin Graham took over the reins from his dad in 2000 and is now CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and heads the Christian relief organization Samaritan’s Purse, which has provided food and medical services to some 100 countries around the world “in Jesus’ name.”

“They’re two different people with two very different temperaments,” Anne Blue Wills, a religion professor at Davidson College in North Carolina who is writing a biography of the elder Graham’s wife, Ruth. “That extends into their thinking about Christianity and theology and the way Christians should engage in the world.”

“Billy Graham tempered his criticisms with an eye to never alienating,” Wills added. “Franklin is just built differently, more willing and readier to draw boundaries and to show where he sees a bright line.”

If Billy Graham had any qualms about his son’s approach, they were never aired in public, Wills said.

“It’s a bit of a mystery how two people with a common calling can go about it so differently,” she said. “It would be interesting to see how Franklin would answer the question.”

Franklin Graham did not return an emailed request for comment sent to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association."

The major issue in the war over Kuwait has been smashing Saddam Hussein's military machine--and, if possible, his regime--it had priority. Some thought was given to post-crisis security arrangements, and some papers have been written--even if far more thought has been given to ridding the region of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, and more time was devoted to that end. Of course, the President's issue with Hussein has never been simply about Kuwait. Bush has said that it's also about oil, Iraq's possession of chemical weapons and effort to achieve a nuclear weapon and about the threat Hussein poses to his neighbors... When he personalized the issue as one between him and Hussein, when he said that Hussein is ""going to get his ass kicked"", he gave credence to the idea that he was proving something. There is also reason to conclude that Bush was spoiling for a fight with Saddam Hussein for some time. Hussein's obduracy raises the question of whether a political settlement was ever possible, but--deliberately or not--Bush left little room for one. In early December, a senior official referred to what he called the ""messy solution"": Saddam Hussein withdraws from less than all of Kuwait and remains in power with his weapons intact. The rationale for our no-concessions, no-compromise policy was that anything that made Saddam Hussein appear to have gained anything from his attack on Kuwait would make him a hero in the eyes of the Arab world, and a future menace."

The information panels, launched in Brazil and India last year, will highlight third-party, fact-checked articles above search results for topics such as ""covid and ibuprofen"" or false claims like ""COVID-19 is a bio-weapon,"" as well as specific searches such as ""did a tornado hit Los Angeles.""

Social media sites including Facebook and Twitter are under pressure to combat misinformation relating to the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus, from false cures to conspiracy theories.

YouTube said in a blog post that more than a dozen US publishers are participating in its fact-checking network, including FactCheck.org, PolitiFact and The Washington Post Fact Checker. The company said it could not share a full list of fact-checking partners.

In 2018, YouTube started using information panels that surfaced links to sources such as Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia for topics considered prone to misinformation, such as ""flat earth"" theories. But it said in Tuesday's blog post that the panels would now help address misinformation in a fast-moving news cycle.

The site has also recently started linking to the World Health Organisation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or local health authorities for videos and searches related to COVID-19.

YouTube did not specify in the blog post how many search terms would prompt the fact-check boxes. It said it would ""take some time for our systems to fully ramp up"" as it rolls out the fact-checking feature.

The feature will only appear on searches, though the company has previously said that its recommendation feature, which encourages people to watch videos similar to those that they have spent significant time viewing in the past, drives the majority of overall ""watch time.""

In January, YouTube said that it had started reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways, such as ""videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness.""

Major social media companies, which have emptied their offices during the pandemic, have warned that their content moderation could be affected by relying on more automated software. In March, Google said this could cause a jump in videos being erroneously removed for policy violations.

Made public Monday by a federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia, the affidavit used to obtain a criminal complaint and arrest warrant for Mr. Assange recalled that WikiLeaks material was found on digital media recovered in 2011 from Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

The affidavit specifically cites separate letters in which Bin Laden requested and received information from a fellow Al Qaeda terrorist concerning material published online by WikiLeaks in 2010. The source of the information was later traced to Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst who subsequently admitted to supplying the site with a trove of documents including classified reports about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Bin Laden asked the Al Qaeda member to gather Department of Defense material released by WikiLeaks and received back information about Afghanistan, FBI special agent Megan Brown wrote in the affidavit.

“Manning and WikiLeaks had reason to believe that public disclosure of the Afghanistan War Reports and Iraq War Reports would cause injury to the United States,” the FBI agent wrote. “Documents included in the Afghanistan War Reports contained information the disclosure of which potentially endangered U.S. troops and Afghan civilians, and aided enemies of the United States.”

The evidence was previously cited during Manning’s court-martial in 2013 as military prosecutors unsuccessfully sought to convict her of “aiding the enemy,” a crime that could have carried a possible life sentence. Manning was acquitted of that charge but found guilty on counts of espionage, computer hacking and theft.

Filed under seal in December 2017, the affidavit against Mr. Assange was made public in the aftermath of his recent extraction from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had lived for nearly seven years under political asylum.

Mr. Assange, 47, is accused by federal prosecutors of conspiring with Manning, 31, to crack a password that would have allowed her to access military documents without authorization. He is being held in London pending further proceedings.

“Encouraging sources to provide information, and using methods to protect their identity, are common practices by all journalists, said Barry Pollack, Mr. Assange’s lawyer. “There is no new information in the affidavit that was unavailable to the Department of Justice when it decided in the Obama administration that pursuing criminal charges against Mr. Assange would be contrary to the First Amendment,” he told Reuters.

Manning served seven years of a 35-year prison sentence prior to having most of her punishment commuted by former President Barack Obama in 2017. She was recently found in contempt of court for refusing to testify in front of a grand jury empaneled by prosecutors investigating WikiLeaks and has been reincarcerated for more than a month, however.

Manning admitted sending WikiLeaks classified documents including reports about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as material including details concerning detainees held by the military at Guantanamo Bay, video footage of a U.S. airstrike killing civilians and hundreds of thousands of U.S. State Department diplomatic cables.

“This is possibly one of the more significant documents of our time, removing the fog of war, and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetric warfare. Have a good day,” she wrote in a 2010 message to WikiLeaks describing the war reports."

How could one of the insiders betray the brotherhood and expose the closely-guarded secrets of the Iranian illuminati?

Years of convincingly deceiving the nation of their benevolence and compassion vanished within a week and the Islamic Republic, the self-proclaimed guardian of religious values and the upholder of the true Islam was stripped bare before the eyes of the entire world. The holier than thou were charged and found guilty of fraud.

Once upon a time, the children of Iran's revolution were placed in a safe bubble where only angels, saints and the pious existed. I for one at least come from the bubble-wrapped generation.

The bubble-wrapped generation learned from television shows that Jesus-looking young men and Mary-like young women serve as the country's security and civil officers, foiling one enemy plot after the other, convincing offenders and terrorists with their charismatic charm to confess to their crimes, and shaming the bad guys with their aura of piety into guilt and repentance.

The bubble-wrapped generation was then offered alternative images with Western movies reeking of decadence, in which cops and secret agents never hesitated to beat the suspect to a pulp to extract a confession.

Horror stories about Abu Ghraib and Gitmo made everyone shiver to the bone and feel blessed that there to protect us were the unnamed soldiers of the Hidden Imam -- God-fearing individuals who have chosen to remain anonymous lest their deeds, which are all an act of worship, be carried out with insincerity.

Alas, the bubble was burst and Iranians realized that there is an Abu Ghraib close to the Iranian capital in Kahrizak.

In the year 2009, the Islamic Republic has reached a point in which the hideous crime of rape has repeatedly taken place and had it not been for the efforts of a little old cleric, regardless of his past actions and initial intentions, it would have been covered up solely to protect the people's bubble.

In the Middle East, a rape victim is viewed as a leper and society either denies their existence or boycotts them.

The disbelief in realizing that the very people who ruthlessly enforced religious law on Iran and prevented young Iranians from higher education if they failed to correctly answer Sharia questions put to them, had not only broken the laws of the divine but also that of man. The children of Iran have been violated, and the representatives of god have condoned it, and not surprisingly now deny their existence.

The law enforcement officers who we had seen on TV and learned in school about their selfless acts and religious zeal were the 'bad guys' shown to us in the alternative imagery. They had tortured, raped and killed.

The Islamic Republic came into existence in 1979 to show the world the glorious deeds a country run by clerics upholding religious values is capable of and to show that righteous leadership can change the world for the better.

However, when institutionalized religion becomes organized religion, the result is a country governed mafia-style. There is always a Hajji (the Don), a Seyyed (the henchman) and the Brothers (the assassins).

One Hajji appoints the propaganda agents (state TV), the Brothers (armed forces), the Seyyed (chief executive) and the lesser Dons (the 12 Guardians). The heads of the families (Experts) are elected by the subjects but appointed with the approval of the lesser Dons.

Sadly it must be said that the issue here is not our youth being violated, it is that Iran has been date-raped and gang raped by the Hajjis, Seyyeds and Brothers for the past 30 years and we are now waking up to the cold hard truth."

Carbon, of course, is the building block of life as we know it. So is it possible that a planet exists in some other solar system where silicon substitutes for carbon? Several science fiction stories feature silicon-based life-forms--sentient crystals, gruesome golden grains of sand and even a creature whose spoor or scat was bricks of silica left behind. The novellas are good reading, but there are a few problems with the chemistry.

Indeed, carbon and silicon share many characteristics. Each has a so-called valence of four--meaning that individual atoms make four bonds with other elements in forming chemical compounds. Each element bonds to oxygen. Each forms long chains, called polymers, in which it alternates with oxygen. In the simplest case, carbon yields a polymer called poly-acetal, a plastic used in synthetic fibers and equipment. Silicon yields polymeric silicones, which we use to waterproof cloth or lubricate metal and plastic parts.

But when carbon oxidizes--or unites with oxygen say, during burning--it becomes the gas carbon dioxide; silicon oxidizes to the solid silicon dioxide, called silica. The fact that silicon oxidizes to a solid is one basic reason as to why it cannot support life. Silica, or sand is a solid because silicon likes oxygen all too well, and the silicon dioxide forms a lattice in which one silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms. Silicate compounds that have SiO -4 units also exist in such minerals as feldspars, micas, zeolites or talcs. And these solid systems pose disposal problems for a living system.

Also consider that a life-form needs some way to collect, store and utilize energy. The energy must come from the environment. Once absorbed or ingested, the energy must be released exactly where and when it is needed. Otherwise, all of the energy might liberate its heat at once, incinerating the life-form. In a carbon-based world, the basic storage element is a carbohydrate having the formula C (HOH) . This carbohydrate oxidizes to water and carbon dioxide, which are then exchanged with the air; the carbons are connected by single bonds into a chain, a process called catenation. A carbon-based life-form ""burns"" this fuel in controlled steps using speed regulators called enzymes.

These large, complicated molecules do their job with great precision only because they have a property called ""handedness."" When any one enzyme ""mates"" with compounds it is helping to react, the two molecular shapes fit together like a lock and key, or a shake of hands. In fact, many carbon-based molecules take advantage of right and left-hand forms. For instance, nature chose the same stable six-carbon carbohydrate to store energy both in our livers (in the form of the polymer called glycogen) and in trees (in the form of the polymer cellulose).

Glycogen and cellulose differ mainly in the handedness of a single carbon atom, which forms when the carbohydrate polymerizes, or forms a chain. Cellulose has the most stable form of the two possibilities; glycogen is the next most stable. Because humans don't have enzymes to break cellulose down into its basic carbohydrate, we cannot utilize it as food. But many lower life-forms, such as bacteria, can.

In short, handedness is the characteristic that provides a variety of biomolecules with their ability to recognize and regulate sundry biological processes. And silicon doesn't form many compounds having handedness. Thus, it would be difficult for a silicon-based life-form to achieve all of the wonderful regulating and recognition functions that carbon-based enzymes perform for us.

All the same, chemists have worked tirelessly to create new silicon compounds, ever since Frederic Stanley Kipping (1863-1949) showed that some interesting ones could be made. The highest international prize in the silicon area is called the Kipping Award. But despite years of work--and despite all the reagents available to the modern alchemist--many silicon analogs of carbon compounds just cannot be formed. Thermodynamic data confirm these analogs are often too unstable or too reactive.

It is possible to think of micro- and nano-structures of silicon; solar-powered silicon forms for energy and sight; a silicone fluid that could carry oxidants to contracting muscle-like elements made of other silicones; skeletal materials of silicates; silicone membranes; and even cavities in silicate zeolites that have handedness. Some of these structures even look alive. But the chemistries needed to create a life-form are simply not there. The complex dance of life requires interlocking chains of reactions. And these reactions can only take place within a narrow range of temperatures and pH levels. Given such constraints, carbon can and silicon can't.

There is one thing silicon can do. Life on earth is predominantly made up of right-hand carbohydrates and left-hand amino acids. Why do they not have the opposite handedness, or both have the same? Many chemists believe that the first ""handed"" carbon compounds formed in a ""soupy"" rock pool having a ""handed"" silica surface. And the handedness of this surface encouraged the creation of those carbon compounds now preferred in Earth's life-forms."
346,True,The article suggests that there was a cover-up regarding the rainmaking experiments and the government's knowledge of them.,True,"The article mentions a team of international scientists, the RAF, and the Ministry of Defence as being involved in the rainmaking experiments.",True,The article describes the rainmaking experiments and the actions taken by the scientists and the RAF to create artificial rain.,False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,True,The article connects events and observations related to the rainmaking experiments and the subsequent flood in Lynmouth.,True,The article suggests that there was secrecy surrounding the rainmaking experiments and the government's denial of knowledge.,"The disaster was officially termed ""the hand of God"" but new evidence from previously classified government files suggests that a team of international scientists working with the RAF was experimenting with artificial rainmaking in southern Britain in the same week and could possibly be implicated.

Squadron Leader Len Otley, who was working on what was known as Operation Cumulus, has told the BBC that they jokingly referred to the rainmaking exercise as Operation Witch Doctor.

His navigator, Group Captain John Hart, remembers the success of these early experiments: ""We flew straight through the top of the cloud, poured dry ice down into the cloud. We flew down to see if any rain came out of the cloud. And it did about 30 minutes later, and we all cheered.""

The meteorological office has in the past denied there were any rainmaking experiments conducted before 1955, but a BBC Radio 4 history investigation, to be broadcast tonight, has unearthed documents recently released at the public record office showing that they were going on from 1949 to 1955. RAF logbooks and personnel corroborate the evidence.

Until now, the Ministry of Defence has categorically denied knowledge of any cloud-seeding experiments taking place in the UK during early August 1952. But documents suggest that Operation Cumulus was going on between August 4 and August 15 1952. The scientists were based at Cranfield school of aeronautics and worked in collaboration with the RAF and the MoD's meteorological research flight based at Farnborough. The chemicals were provided by ICI in Billingham.

Met office reports from these dates describe flights undertaken to collect data on cumulus cloud temperature, water content, icing rate, vertical motions and turbulence, and water droplet and ice crystal formation. There is no mention of cloud seeding.

But a 50-year-old radio broadcast unearthed by Radio 4 describes an aeronautical engineer and glider pilot, Alan Yates, working with Operation Cumulus at the time and flying over Bedfordshire, spraying quantities of salt. He was elated when the scientists told him this had led to a heavy downpour 50 miles away over Staines, in Middlesex.

""I was told that the rain had been the heaviest for several years - and all out of a sky which looked summery ... there was no disguising the fact that the seedsman had said he'd make it rain, and he did. Toasts were drunk to meteorology and it was not until the BBC news bulletin [about Lynmouth] was read later on, that a stony silence fell on the company,"" said Mr Yates at the time.

Operation Cumulus was put on hold indefinitely after the tragedy.

Declassified minutes from an air ministry meeting, held in the war office on November 3, 1953, show why the military were interested in increasing rain and snow by artificial means. The list of possible uses included ""bogging down enemy movement"", ""incrementing the water flow in rivers and streams to hinder or stop enemy crossings"", and clearing fog from airfields.

The documents also talk of rainmaking having a potential ""to explode an atomic weapon in a seeded storm system or cloud. This would produce a far wider area of radioactive contamination than in a normal atomic explosion"".

UK weather modification experiments at the time presaged current practice in the US. The idea was to target ""super cool"" clouds, and to increase the volume of freezing water vapour particles. Most methods involved firing particles of salt, dry ice, or silver iodide, into clouds, either from an aeroplane or from burners on the ground. The clouds would then precipitate, pulled down below freezing point by the extra weight of dense particles, thus making it rain sooner and heavier than it might have done. Significantly, it was claimed that silver iodide could cause a downpour up to 300 miles away.

Many countries now use the technology, which has considerably improved during the past 50 years.

But controversy still surrounds the efficacy of these early cloud-seeding experiments. In 1955 questions were asked in the Commons about the possibilites of liability and compensation claims. Documents seen by the BBC suggest that both the air ministry and the Treasury became very anxious and were aware that rainmaking could cause damage, not just to military targets and personnel, but also to civilians.

The British Geological Survey has recently examined soil sediments in the district of Lynmouth to see if any silver or iodide residues remain. The testing has been limited due to restrictions in place because of foot and mouth disease, and it is inconclusive. However, silver residue has been discovered in the catchment waters of the river Lyn. The BGS will investigate further over the next 18 months.

Survivors of the Lynmouth flood called for - but never got - a full investigation into the causes of the disaster. Rumours persist to this day of planes circling before the inundation.

The 18-month-old boy died on Feb. 18, a Berlin health department official told Agence France-Presse. He is the first known fatality among more than 570 recorded measles cases since October in the capital alone.

The resurgence of the preventable disease in Germany, as well as in parts of the U.S., coincides with a movement among some parents to refuse to vaccinate their children.

Health Minister Hermann Groehe over the weekend said that ""the irrational fear-mongering of some vaccination foes is irresponsible.""

""Those who refuse to vaccinate their children endanger not only them but others, threatening serious health problems,"" Groehe said.

German national health officials said Monday there were no current plans to make measles vaccinations mandatory.

But they said the government would ensure that parents receive advice on the need for immunizations when children start early child care. Vaccination certificates would also be checked during regular doctors visits, a health ministry spokeswoman said.

""If that doesn't help, other steps will have to be considered,"" she added.

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's center for disease control and prevention, said the Berlin wave of infections had ""initially affected primarily asylum seekers, mostly from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.""

""But now cases of the disease are occurring primarily amid the general population of Berlin,"" it said in a statement.

Measles causes fever and rash, and in severe cases can lead to pneumonia or brain swelling, sometimes fatal. The disease is highly contagious because it is transmitted through the air.

Many people who do not vaccinate their children say they fear a triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is responsible for increasing cases of autism — a theory disproven by various studies. The controversy dates back to the publication of a now-debunked article that was published in the Lancet medical journal in 1998.

Some parents also refuse vaccination on religious or political grounds.

Berlin health ministry chief Mario Czaja said the infant's death confirmed that measles is a serious disease. ""There are many foes of immunization who dismiss measles as a childhood disease,"" he was quoted as saying by national news agency DPA.

Czaja urged adults to check whether they had received a measles vaccine, saying the immunization rate amid children in Berlin stood at 95 percent.

At least one high school in Berlin was closed Monday following a reported case of measles. Students and staff have been asked to bring proof when the school reopens Tuesday that they had been vaccinated against the disease."
348,True,The article mentions various conspiracy theories blaming different actors for oil price movements.,True,"The article mentions Reagan, Saudis, oil companies, and speculators as actors responsible for price moves.",True,"The article mentions actions such as crashing the price of oil, blaming oil companies and speculators, and the loss of imports due to freighter sinkings and military cooptation of ships.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to support the conspiracy theories.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Throughout my career, many reasons have been advanced for oil price movements, from the claim that Reagan encouraged the Saudis to crash the price of oil in 1986 to hurt the Soviet economy, leading to their downfall, to various conspiracy theories blaming the oil companies, speculators, and so forth, for price moves up and down. Amazingly, except for oil analysts, few point to market forces.

Of course, this is nothing new. During World War I, British citizens blamed speculators for higher food prices, ignoring the extreme shortage of agricultural workers off fighting the war and the loss of imports due to freighter sinkings and military cooptation of ships. The Bible doesn’t mention complaints about high grain prices during the seven lean years in Egypt, but no doubt they were there.

In modern times, when the gods (or God) are no longer blamed for commodity price fluctuations, there is still a tendency amongst neo-Malthusians to see every price spike as evidence of impending collapse, the exceeding of the world’s ""carrying capacity"". This is best characterized by Paul Ehrlich’s famous 1968 The Population Bomb, where he criticizes ""...professional optimists around who like to greet every sign of dropping birth rates with wild pronouncements about the end of the population explosion."" A mere eight pages later, he then notes that the 1965-66 harvest was particularly poor, as if one bad harvest validated of his beliefs.

This type of misinterpretation has certainly been the case with the latest commodity ""supercycle,"" which many oil analysts have seen as simply a period of strong markets, cyclical in nature, attributed by others as due to resource scarcity, even claiming we are threatened with ‘peak everything’. Others claim a ""new regime"" has been inaugurated, with different characteristics because of, primarily, high Chinese demand growth–although global demand growth has been sluggish in the past decade.

This behavior reminds me of nothing so much as the fringe Bigfoot researchers who interpret everything as proof of the existence of Sasquatch, Yeti, Skunk Ape, etc. My favorite was the cable show where the Bigfoot hunter, in the woods at night, hears a noise and shouts, ""It’s Bigfoot!"" as if nothing but Bigfoot could possibly make a noise in the woods.

Similarly, the unrest in Venezuela and the post 9/11 lead-up to the overthrown of Hussein both coincide with the rise in prices in 2002/3 and beyond. The failure of Iraqi oil production to recovery as expected, the boom in oil demand in 2004–the largest increase in the history of the industry, in absolute terms, are waved off as irrelevant. And they were followed by the massive disruptions of Katrina, the loss of supply from the Nigerian unrest since 2007, and the Arab Spring which meant over 1.5 mb/d of high quality crude from Libya in 2011, much of it still shut-in.

In the meantime, global oil production rose from 77 mb/d in 2003 to 86 in 2013, but, we’re told, oil production has peaked and this explains higher prices–just as predicted by the neo-Malthusians. Instead, we are seeing yet another example of the adage, ""The cure for high prices is high prices."""

We've been looking into some of them and other dubious coronavirus claims.

In the UK, the NHS contract-tracing app has been a focus of conspiracies and false rumours. The mobile-phone software is being introduced to help work out who an infected person might have spread the virus to, but it's run into technical problems and the launch has been delayed.
• What if NHS coronavirus tracers contact me?

One message we've seen being copied and pasted on Facebook asks the poster's friends to delete them as contacts from their phone and unfriend them on Facebook as the app will ""ask permission to access all of your contacts"".

This post misrepresents how the app works. It does not access a user's phone contacts but instead records when two people who both have the app are within a certain distance of each other for longer than a specified amount of time.

Another variation that has been shared hundreds of times on Facebook claims that app users who walk past someone who later gets ""flu"" symptoms will automatically have to be quarantined, along with all their family.

But users who receive a notification from the app that they have been near someone who has developed symptoms do not automatically have to go into quarantine. If they live in a household where no-one is showing symptoms, they will be asked to follow social-distancing advice and look out for symptoms.

This story, which has been marked as containing ""false information"" by third-party fact checkers on Facebook, also claims you could be forced to have a vaccine under the new coronavirus law. There is no current legislation in the UK that can force you to take a vaccine.

A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's senior aide was the target of false rumours connected to the contact-tracing app. There was no truth in the social-media posts that suggested that Dominic Cummings' sister worked for a company running the app.

Fact-checking organisation Full Fact carried out an investigation and concluded that the woman named wasn't his sister and the company named hadn't been involved in the app.

The development of the NHS contact-tracing app has been accompanied by all manner of misinformation and conspiracy theories - but there are some genuine issues about privacy. The UK has chosen to go down a centralised route, but many other countries are developing decentralised apps. The team behind the UK app has insisted that this route will give the NHS more valuable information about how the virus is spreading.

Contact tracing features in an interview with an American doctor who says he ""doesn't believe in Covid-19"".

Asked why there's distancing in place, he says one reason may be to facilitate ""tracking software - the contact-tracing programmes"".

This seems to misconstrue the aims of social distancing and contact tracing - and the use of any app to support it - which is to prevent the spread of the virus alongside the easing of social-distancing rules.

Dr Kaufman suggests the signal for the ""tracking software"" is clearer if people are separated from each other. But this isn't how the apps will work because they use your device's unique digital signature irrespective of how close it is to another phone.

In the video Andrew Kaufman also explains his opposition to lockdowns and vaccinations.

Several uploads of this post have been removed from YouTube for violating its community policies.

A page administrator for a local group in Hampshire told the BBC that they had removed the video along with multiple anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown posts over the last few days.

Another administrator from a page based in Cornwall said that controversial posts were fine, as long as discussion remained ""civil"".

While we're here, one last series of widely shared posts is worth highlighting.

Near-identical Facebook entries in multiple languages claim Italy has discovered a coronavirus cure. The posts falsely claim that coronavirus is not a virus but a bacterium causing deadly blood clots.

It's true that Covid-19 has led to blood clots in some of the most severe cases in patients with pneumonia. Bacterial infections do develop after contracting a virus. But the disease Covid-19 is caused by a virus.

Bear in mind that blood clots can also appear in the lungs, caused by pneumonia from ordinary flu, and anyone going into hospital is at increased risk of blood clots, too.

The posts go on to argue that antibiotics, aspirin and anticoagulants (often used to treat blood clots) can therefore cure coronavirus. They can't - there is no known cure and the WHO warns against self-medication to treat the virus, including with antibiotics.

The sources of this information are apparently Italian doctors and the Italian ministry of health. We have emailed the ministry for comment.

""In reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,"" said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan in the northern region of Lombardy, which has borne the brunt of Italy's coronavirus outbreak.

""The swabs that were performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load in quantitative terms that was absolutely infinitesimal compared to the ones carried out a month or two months ago,"" he told RAI television.

Italy has the third-highest death toll in the world fromCOVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, with 33,415 people dying since the outbreak came to light on February 21.

It has the sixth-highest global number of cases at 233,019.

However, new infections and fatalities have fallen steadily in May and the country is unwinding some of the most rigid lockdown restrictions introduced anywhere in Europe.

Zangrillo said some experts were too alarmist about the prospect of a second wave of infections and politicians needed to take into account the new reality.

""We've got to get back to being a normal country,"" he said. ""Someone has to take responsibility for terrorising the country.""

The government urged caution, saying it was far too soon to claim victory.

""Pending scientific evidence to support the thesis that the virus has disappeared...I would invite those who say they are sure of it not to confuse Italians,"" Sandra Zampa, an under-secretary at the health ministry, said in a statement.

""We should instead invite Italians to maintain the maximum caution, maintain physical distancing, avoid large groups, to frequently wash their hands and to wear masks.""

A second doctor from northern Italy told the national ANSA news agency that he was also seeing the coronavirus weaken.

""The strength the virus had two months ago is not the same strength it has today,"" said Matteo Bassetti, head of the infectious diseases clinic at the San Martino hospital in the city of Genoa.

""It is clear that today the COVID-19 disease is different."""

Hussein was raised by his mother, her second husband Ibrahim al-Hassan and her brother Khairallah Talfah.

Hussein's first wife, Sajida, was his first cousin, the daughter of his maternal uncle Khairallah Talfah.

Many of Hussein's family members were part of his regime: Brother-in-law Brig. General Adnan Khairallah was Minister of Defense. Sons-in-law General Hussein Kamel, husband to Raghad Hussein, led Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons program and his brother, Colonel Saddam Kamel, husband to Rana Hussein, was in charge of the presidential security forces. Eldest son Uday was head of the Iraqi Olympic Committee and younger son Qusay was head of the Internal Security Forces. And half-brother Busho Ibrahim was the Deputy Minister of Justice.



1956 - Takes part in an unsuccessful coup to overthrow King Faisal II and Prime Minister Nuri as-Said.

July 14, 1958 - King Faisal is killed in a coup led by Abdul Karim Kassem.

October 1959 - Hussein and others attack the motorcade of Abdul Karim Kassem. The assassination attempt fails and most of the attackers are killed. Hussein escapes and flees to Syria. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser hears of Hussein's exploits and arranges for him to travel to Cairo.

February 8, 1963 - Kassem is overthrown and executed, and the Baath Party takes over. Hussein returns from Cairo. The new Baath government is overthrown before the end of the year.

1964-1967 - Is arrested and imprisoned after a change in government. He later escapes.

July 17, 1968 - In a bloodless coup, Major General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr of the Baath party becomes Iraq's new president. Hussein becomes secretary and acting deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council.

October 1978 - At the Shah's insistence, Hussein expels Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini from Iraq. Khomeini had been in exile in Iraq since 1965.

353,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions Twitter, AI, Mark Cuban, and Jack Dorsey as actors involved in utilizing AI on the platform.",True,"The article discusses how Twitter is utilizing AI in various ways, such as predicting users' feed, identifying hate speech, and cropping photos.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"In recent years, Twitter has developed a negative association with bots, with the microblogging platform wiping out 6% of its user base by deleting tens of millions of artificial intelligence-powered accounts.

However, AI has become increasingly important to how the platform operates. Twitter has stepped up its AI capabilities in the last few years, after purchasing Magic Pony, a machine learning start-up in 2016, signalling that the company is keen to invest in this area.

In 2017 American businessman and investor Mark Cuban invested in the social media site after it “finally got [its] act together with artificial intelligence”, but how is Twitter utilising the technology?

Here’s how this is being put into practice.

AI controls what appears on your feed

In 2017, Twitter overhauled how users’ feeds are organised, by using an AI algorithm to predict which tweets users would most like to see.



By using Natural Language Processing and tweet-ranking algorithms, Twitter analyses thousands of tweets per second to predict over time what tweets users would find most interesting, and shows them first rather that displaying them in reverse chronological order to “show the best tweets first”.

However, this update proved unpopular with many users. A tweet telling users how to change settings to go back to the old timeline went viral, with 40,000 likes, and many took to the platform to complain about the change.

It is now possible to switch from an algorithmic timeline back to a chronological one.

After being criticised for not taking action to prevent the spread of hate speech on the platform, Twitter has turned to AI to help combat the issue. The sheer volume of tweets sent every day, identifying potentially harmful content is impossible without the use of AI. In 2018 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that he wanted the company to do more to increase “The collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.”

Twitter AI is being used to identify racist content and hate speech, or content from extremist groups, using algorithms to flag up tweets using hate speech or promoting terrorist activities.

According to the Financial Times in the first half of 2017, AI-powered bots identified and took down 300,000 terrorist-related accounts.

AI use doesn’t always go to plan

However, some of the platform’s experiments with AI have not been so successful. In 2016, Microsoft, in collaboration with Twitter, released an AI chatbot called Tay, which tweeted based on interactions with human users.

However, the chatbot was taken down after posted inflammatory and offensive tweets, mimicking right-wing internet trolls, who bombarded it with racist and sexist phrases.

Later that year Microsoft released Zo, Tay’s successor which was designed to avoid unintended inflammatory tweets. Zo now holds the record for the longest chatbot conversation, which lasted nine hours and 53 minutes.

Many ways in which AI is employed by the platform may not be immediately obvious, but instead subtly improve the user experience.

Last year, Twitter introduced a feature that uses AI to crop photos. It uses neural networks to identify the most interesting part of a photo to display as a thumbnail."

Investment in vaccination is essential even if the cost is high to ensure that the pandemic does not resurface and cause greater damage in the long run.

George Magnus, an economist, shared an article on the cost of vaccinating billions of people against the Covid-19 disease, which is estimated at $20bn.

He noted that the pandemic is estimated to cost the world more than $2tn in lost GDP.



Magnus added that even if the cost of vaccination is $100bn, it will still be worth the investment to protect both the population and the economy."

""I'm taking a a very long-term approach, and holding onto stocks and funds already in my portfolio, and investing free cash while prices are low,"" one reader told us. ""I'm looking for stocks with solid balance sheets,"" wrote another. ""In 2008, I rode it out, but this time, I am transitioning to 'safer' investments during rallies,"" said another reader in response to our survey questions.

Older, wealthier investors say they're leaning on the lessons they learned during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-09, and not panicking during the recent market sell off and subsequent return. But the recent rebound for equities has them feeling a little more bearish as the U.S. economy comes to grips with a sudden recession punctuated with the highest unemployment in nearly a century.

The recovery in the stock market may look similar to 2009, but the economy is in a much different and precarious state than it was then. Investor anxiety over personal finance issues is at a record high, casting more doubts about the sustainability of the stock market's recent streak.

Of the nearly 1,200 respondents, over half were invested during the 2008-09 recession, and 74% of those were baby boomers or older, while a quarter were Gen X or younger. Older investors tend to have more invested, with more than 60% of our respondents owning portfolios of $500,000 or more.

These investors have more to lose than younger generations, and less time to recover from losses. Indeed, they were more cautious than those who weren't invested in 2008-09, with more than 60% indicating they are bearish or neutral, and less than 40% claiming to be bullish.

How are They Responding to the Market?

More than half of respondents say recent events have them more worried than 2008-09, leading many to say they’re making fewer portfolio moves than their counterparts who were not invested during the financial crisis.

Many are favoring high yield savings accounts and money markets, following a herd of institutional investors who have stampeded that way. Mutual funds continue to see outflows, while this group has been favoring index funds and ETFs.

Older investors who are making changes to their investment strategy are split when it comes to stocks, with 33% investing less, and 44% investing more.

When it comes to individual stocks, these investors have generally been playing it safe, with a few exceptions. Amazon (AMZN) has been the fan favorite for this group and just about every other investor of late. The stock hits all-time highs on a regular basis, and has been a clear beneficiary of the stay-at-home economy. Amazon is also among the most widely held stocks in index funds and technology ETFs, and its oversized market cap of nearly $1.2 trillion gives it a heavy influence in the cap-weighted S&P 500.

Outside of Amazon, these investors have favored blue chip stocks like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, PepsiCo, Facebook and Intel. Some of the wildcards appearing in these affluent investors portfolios include Tesla, which has been an entertaining stock to hold, and a profitable one for long-term investors, and Gilead Sciences, which is likely a bet on a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.

While opportunistic at times, our more experienced investors, especially not yet in retirement, are caught in a classic risk/reward dilemma. While they don't want to give up gains they amassed over the last 11 years, the momentum behind the recent surge in stocks is hard to ignore."

1:00 PM ET | The Speed of Science Post-COVID-19

Presented by Genentech

The Coronavirus pandemic has forced medical researchers, drug makers, and vaccine developers to move fast, without sacrificing safety. The drug development and approval process takes time to balance the safety and efficacy of therapies while minimizing public health risks. But in the quest to understand the deadly virus that causes COVID-19 and find a cure, scientists have accelerated their research methods and clinical trials. As a consequence, policymakers, public health officials and health care providers are getting access to medical research and potential treatments much faster than before the outbreak. As the scientific ecosystem changes in response to the pandemic, how might it re-shape medical research, drug development and health care?

Join POLITICO on Wednesday, June 24, for a deep-dive conversation on the future of science in a post-Covid-19 world. Explore what lessons can be learned to accelerate medical research outside of the coronavirus, what can be done to minimize misinformation from flawed or inaccurate scientific studies published during a public health emergency and how can newly developed drugs and vaccines be distributed equitably.The program will feature a conversation between Patrick Steel, Chief Executive Officer of POLITICO and Alexander Hardy, Chief Executive Officer of Genentech.

9:00 AM ET | Global Translations Virtual Interview

Across the world, low income workers have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19-induced economic crisis. In the U.S., near 40% of low income workers have lost their jobs. Globally the situation’s even more dire: More than half the world’s workers have few rights and no unemployment protections. Join Global Translations author Ryan Heath for a virtual interview with Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of The International Trade Union Confederation, covering what needs to be done about Covid-19 inequalities; why Burrow supports protests against companies like Amazon; and how she thinks the future for trade unions — in a world dominated by gig and informal work — is working in lockstep with other movements, like climate and anti-racism activists.

Big Pharma should be writhing in embarrassment this week after The Washington Post and “60 Minutes” reported that pharmaceutical lobbyists had manipulated Congress to hamstring the Drug Enforcement Administration. But the abuse goes far beyond that: The industry systematically manipulated the entire country for 25 years, and its executives are responsible for many of the 64,000 deaths of Americans last year from drugs — more than the number of Americans who died in the Vietnam and Iraq wars combined."

The report, issued today by Institute of Medicine (IOM), also blames ""constraints"" on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the program falling short of its goals.

After the 9/11 attacks and anthrax letters, President Bush announced a plan to vaccinate 500,000 health care workers, and eventually up to 10 million other emergency responders and interested members of the public, against smallpox (Science, 20 December 2002, p. 2312). But the effort soon foundered, especially after--as expected--the vaccine caused side effects such as cardiac problems in a small fraction of people. When the program wound down in mid-2003, only about 40,000 people had been vaccinated.

The IOM report notes that ""top officials of the executive branch"" departed from recommendations from advisors to vaccinate only 500,000 people. The officials offered ""only vague explanation"" for vaccinating a much larger number of people even though the vaccine carries risks and there was no evidence of an imminent attack. Because the ""public health reasoning behind"" the vaccination policy ""was never fully explained,"" workers implementing the program ""remained skeptical"" and that led to ""poor participation,"" the report says.

What's more, the CDC's normally open communication of scientific rationale to public health departments ""seemed constrained by unknown external influences"" and this hindered the campaign. IOM panel chair Brian Strom, a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, declined to elaborate on these ""influences"" for reporters, saying the panel did not know ""who dictated what to whom.""

The report refrains from calling the effort a failure, however. Even though only 40,000 people were vaccinated, the episode has apparently improved preparedness, Strom says, citing the quick response to a subsequent monkeypox outbreak and to the threat of SARS. But the report calls for a thorough look at the nation's smallpox preparedness. And above all, Strom says the report concludes that while national security concerns have to be balanced against scientific information, the CDC ""or any other agency needs to speak from the science.""

On the morning of June 17, 1972, five men were arrested after breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. The media, led by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, doggedly pursued the story, exposing wiretaps, secret documents, and hush money. President Richard Nixon denied involvement in the scandal, declaring, “I am not a crook,” in a nationally televised press conference. But the White House cover-up failed. Faced with almost certain impeachment, Nixon resigned from his second term in office on August 9, 1974.

The White Sox shocked the nation when they threw the World Series. Nearly a century ago, some members of the Chicago White Sox baseball team accepted a bribe—as much as $100,000 (about $1.4 million today)—to deliberately lose the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Suspicions arose in the first game after uncharacteristically sloppy pitching by the White Sox, who were heavily favored to win. “I don’t know why I did it,” pitcher Eddie Cicotte testified before a grand jury. “I must have been crazy.” He and seven other players, including “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, were indicted on nine counts of conspiracy but acquitted by a jury. They were banned from the game for life.

Many made claims to be the grand duchess of Russia, but all of them were frauds. It was a gruesome crime: In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries executed Russian tsar Nicholas II, the empress, and their five children. But did Anastasia, the youngest daughter, escape? Several impersonators exploited this hope, most famously Anna Anderson, an Anastasia look-alike who filed an unsuccessful suit in 1938 to try to prove her identity—and claim an inheritance. Anderson, who had supporters as well as detractors, died in 1984. A posthumous DNA test found she was unrelated to the Romanovs and appeared to confirm she was a Polish factory worker named Franziska Schanzkowska.

A famous swindler lends his name to a fraudulent scheme that still endures. In 1919 Italian immigrant Charles Ponzi built a pyramid scheme around international postal reply coupons. Ponzi, who brought in $250,000 a day at the peak of his scheme (about three million dollars today), conned investors into sending him millions of dollars, promising eye-popping returns. Ponzi’s scam—paying one investor with money from others—unraveled in August 1920, when he was charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. In 2008 modern-day Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff was arrested after bilking investors—including Steven Spielberg, Sandy Koufax, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Elie Wiesel—out of billions.

A gifted showman, P. T. Barnum exploited the public’s desire to be amazed. At his first spectacle, in 1835, showman Phineas Taylor Barnum touted Joice Heth as George Washington’s 161-year-old nursemaid. Crowds came gawking to see “the greatest natural & national curiosity in the world.” Barnum profited from the public’s hunger for entertainment by planting embellishments and lies in newspapers. His fabrication about Heth blew up after her death, when an autopsy found her to be no more than 80 years old. Barnum’s flair for fake news culminated when, in ill health, he arranged for the publication of his own obituary so he could read it before he died.

Piltdown man, a clever fabrication of a human ancestor, created a sensation. In 1912 fossil enthusiast Charles Dawson and his collaborator Arthur Smith Woodward, a geologist at the British Natural History Museum, announced the unearthing of humanlike skull fragments and an apelike jawbone from a gravel pit near Piltdown, England. Just a few years earlier, Dawson had written to Smith Woodward, saying he was “waiting for the big ‘find.’ ” But Piltdown man, initially hailed as the missing link connecting ape to human, was a fraud: The bones were stained to resemble ancient fossils, and the teeth, from an orangutan, had been filed down to appear human."
360,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions Barack Obama, Russian government officials, Russian programmer Alisa Shevchenko, the GRU (Russian military intelligence services), and the FSB (Russian secret service agencies).",True,"The article mentions Barack Obama retaliating against alleged Russian interference, expelling Russian government officials, placing sanctions on Russian security agencies, companies, and individuals.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article discusses the evidence presented to tie Russian intelligence services with the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"As one of his parting acts as US President, Barack Obama retaliated against alleged Russian interference in the recent US election by expelling 35 Russian government officials from the US and placing sanctions on Russian security agencies, 3 companies and several individuals.

One of the companies included on the sanctions list was Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) which was set up by a Russian programmer Alisa Shevchenko. According to the White House, Zorsecurity was included because it had provided the GRU (one of Russia’s military intelligence services) “with technical research and development”.

And that was it. Except that Shevchenko has vehemently denied that she has worked for the Russian government stating that “We don’t make malware for the Russian government”.

The difficulty for Shevchenko is that she simply doesn’t know what being placed on a sanctions list means for her personally. To be clear, there was no trial, no evidence presented publicly, nor was there an opportunity to provide a defence, there was simply an accusation and a listing on a public announcement.

What makes this particularly frustrating for Shevchenko is that the company listed doesn’t actually trade any more and so from one perspective the entire matter is moot.

It seems extraordinary that high stakes response to the Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin should have on the one hand two of Russia’s secret service agencies, the FSB and GRU and on the other hand a defunct company run at one time by a solitary Russian hacker with a handful of employees.

It has been argued that the evidence put forward to tie the Russian intelligence services with the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was not definitive enough to prove the link. Evidence for Russian involvement comes essentially from comparing the malware and techniques used by the hackers to previous hacks believed to be by specific groups, in this case from two groups called APT 28 (Aka Fancy Bear) and APT 29 (Aka Cozy Bear). These groups in turn are thought to be associated with the GRU (APT 28) and FSB (APT 29).

Whilst the debate continues of whether the evidence presented is actually sufficient to definitively tie specific groups to the hack, none of the evidence presented ties in with Shevchenko and Zorsecurity.

Shevchenko’s situation highlights the perils of being associated with cybersecurity even if you are one of the good guys, the so-called “White Hat” hackers. She is a self-taught and talented programmer who specialises in finding “zero-day” exploits. Whilst these exploits can, and are, used by criminals and spies, they can also be used to probe weaknesses in corporate networks as part of what is called penetration testing. In fact, Shevchenko has publicly contributed to finding and reporting vulnerabilities in energy management software and Microsoft Windows.

It is possible that some of her software or exploits were used by the GRU and FSB (and others) in gaining access to the DNC and other targets, however that is a different matter to her, or the company actively working with these agencies. Given the large number of companies and people who could potentially be involved with hacking on behalf the Russian services, it seems gratuitous that the US would single out a solitary female hacker to shoulder the entire blame.

The irony here is that in his rush to publicly be seen to respond to Russian hacking, Obama has sought to punish a female programmer working in cybersecurity. A key tenant of his presidency was to try and boost the participation of women in the tech industry with his own secret service agency the NSA employing hackers in their ongoing struggle to recruit real talent.

Not only is Shevchenko in a minority of women working in this area of programming but she has been extremely active in engaging in conferences and the open source community to develop and contribute software, knowledge and expertise. Alisa Shevchenko was also one of the founders of a community “hack space” Neuron Hackspace. None of this particularly suggested an idealogue dedicated to the hacking of the DNC.

Inadvertently perhaps, Obama has sent a clear message of the dangers for cybersecurity experts in becoming collateral damage in the political battles between the US, Russia and China. Just possibly, he has also just reinforced the extra dangers for women who stand out from the crowd?

In an additional irony, it may be that incoming US President Donald Trump will come to Shevchenko’s aid. He has indicated that he may reverse Obama’s sanctions against the Russians, especially if the Russians collaborate with the US against terrorism."

Scientists at Area 51 have successfully reverse-engineered an interstellar spacecraft. And there's a fully-functional subterranean city underneath Washington, D.C., ready for the president and U.S. Congress to relocate to, should the Elders of Zion authorize their Beijing subsidiary to launch an ICBM first strike. If you believe that, or at least find any of it plausible, congratulations. You might be susceptible to being exploited for financial gain, which is exactly what they want you to think.

Conspiracy theories have probably been around for centuries, but it's only recently that the dissemination of the unverifiable has become an industry unto itself. While publicizing secrets to expose corruption and hypocrisy is a laudable goal, some conspiracy theorists don't seem all that concerned with the veracity of what they claim. If their fanciful theories and loaded questions can translate into money, all the better.

The most ""mainstream"" conspiracy theory peddler operating today doesn't necessarily fit the stereotype of broadcasting via shortwave radio from an underground bunker. Quite the contrary. He's a former governor and a speculative future presidential candidate. He also spent six years as an employee of the same federal government that he currently rails against - though granted, that time was spent in Vietnam with the U.S. Navy's Underwater Demolition Team, a predecessor of the SEALs.

That'd be Jesse Ventura. The erstwhile non-partisan former chief executive of Minnesota is the most recognizable face of an industry committed to setting the record straight about such calamities like the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 and 9/11, even though the record as it stands is as straight as it'll ever be. (Note: Muslim terrorists, and not the White House, were responsible for the World Trade Center attacks). Ventura has written seven books since entering (and then exiting) politics, and as time has progressed, the book titles have gotten more provocative and shocking. His first book, written while in office, is subtitled ""Reworking The Body Politic From The Bottom Up."" More recent titles include ""63 Documents The Government Doesn't Want You To Read"" and ""DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODicans.""

Does Ventura make money from his books that threaten to uncover the truth about, well, almost everything? Ventura would be financially successful even if he'd never written a word, enjoying lucrative careers as both a professional wrestler and wrestling commentator (not to mention a brief film career in the 1980s). While it's easy for any famous person who wants one to get a publishing deal, especially when that famous person has plenty to say, the politically unaligned Ventura showed his independent streak by signing with an unheralded publisher.

Ventura's books have sold in the thousands. At an average list price of $15, and assuming standard author royalties of 15% for such a relatively successful print run, and then assuming that Ventura gets $3 for every $2 that his less famous coauthor receives, that's still a ton of money. That goes relatively far in Ventura's adopted home of rural Baja California, Mexico, but it isn't enough money to change an already affluent man's life.

Ventura's auditory counterpart is Alex Jones, host of an eponymous radio show that purports to tell the unvarnished truth about everything from the concentration camps that President Obama might be preparing to hold us captive in to the hypocrisy of the Federal Reserve. Jones's show is broadcast on 60 stations, distributed by a network far smaller than industry titans such as CBS Radio and Premiere. Jones boasts almost 300,000 YouTube subscribers, but that's hardly a financial indicator. (Rush Limbaugh, the most successful terrestrial radio personality in the nation, has no YouTube subscribers.) However, rough estimates put Jones's net worth at a not unsubstantial $5 million, which is a lot of logo coffee mugs and t-shirts. Jones is a household name only in selected (and well-fortified) households, but his devotees are ardent in their fandom.

That being said, is exploiting the paranoia of the misinformed a path to riches? Signs point to ""No."" For every brilliant self-promoter such as Ventura or Jones, there are dozens if not hundreds of others whose oddball theories about the New World Order and the Kennedy Assassination not only don't stand up to scrutiny but can't be monetized. Concocting alternate realities seldom translates into wealth, a few notable exceptions notwithstanding. But tell that to the independent blogger who's convinced that the media-industrial complex is silencing his airtight explanation of how aliens brought the AIDS virus to Earth. To generalize, the same minds that consider fluoridated water to be a Communist plot are going to be similarly gullible regarding the success of for-profit endeavors.

It's fun and flattering to assume that you're privy to knowledge that the general population is not. And of course, it's not exactly news that politicians and their mouthpieces lie to us at least as often as they tell the truth. But if being among the few enlightened enough to know ""the truth"" is a path to making lots of money, the conspiracy theorists are hiding their riches convincingly. I guess it's still the consumer's responsibility to recognize these scams and stop them in their tracks if they want to avoid falling (and paying) for these deceiving lies themselves. Some are more obvious than others, however, and some are more entertaining than others, too."

• In reality, most of Nostradamus' prophecies are poorly translated — and vaguely worded enough to encourage tons of speculation.



Nostradamus' name is synonymous with predicting the future.

The alleged oracle began publishing his famous, cryptic quatrains in 1555. But these were no ordinary poems. Nostradamus was allegedly a diviner who was able predict future tidings.

The 16th century apothecary and astrologer's status as a reputed ""seer"" allowed him to solicit patronage from wealthy and prominent individuals like Catherine de' Medici, the queen of France.

Nostradamus' star didn't fade after his death in 1566. His works have continued to attract adherents who have connected his writings to earth-shattering events like the rise of Adolf Hitler and the 9/11 attacks.

But, like horoscopes, the predictions themselves tend to be vaguely worded, and therefore open to the reader's interpretations and biases.

In ""Nostradamus, Bibliomancer: The Man, the Myth, the Truth,"" biographer Peter Lemesurier concludes that Nostradamus ""believed that history repeats itself"" and used the technique of projecting past events onto the future in order to make realistic-sounding claims. What's more, scholars have argued the modern translations of Nostradamus' writing are sloppy and unreliable.

With all that in mind, here's a look back at some of Nostradamus' most famous predictions:"

Two decades ago DePaulo and her colleagues asked 147 adults to jot down for a week every instance they tried to mislead someone. The researchers found that the subjects lied on average one or two times a day. Most of these untruths were innocuous, intended to hide one’s inadequacies or to protect the feelings of others. Some lies were excuses—one subject blamed the failure to take out the garbage on not knowing where it needed to go. Yet other lies—such as a claim of being a diplomat’s son—were aimed at presenting a false image. While these were minor transgressions, a later study by DePaulo and other colleagues involving a similar sample indicated that most people have, at some point, told one or more “serious lies”—hiding an affair from a spouse, for example, or making false claims on a college application.

The question Ariely finds interesting is not why so many lie, but rather why they don’t lie a lot more. Even when the amount of money offered for correct answers is raised significantly, the volunteers don’t increase their level of cheating. “Here we give people a chance to steal lots of money, and people cheat only a little bit. So something stops us—most of us—from not lying all the way,” Ariely says. The reason, according to him, is that we want to see ourselves as honest, because we have, to some degree, internalized honesty as a value taught to us by society. Which is why, unless one is a sociopath, most of us place limits on how much we are willing to lie. How far most of us are willing to go—Ariely and others have shown—is determined by social norms arrived at through unspoken consensus, like the tacit acceptability of taking a few pencils home from the office supply cabinet."

The author of the 1998 paper, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, and his co-authors reaffirmed their findings after complaints about Wakefield's research surfaced in 2004.

However, the medical journal BMJ reported Tuesday, the examination into how the study was conducted was led by the editor of the Lancet, which published the paper, and involved ""no formal investigation"" of the allegations.

""In short, the accused were investigating themselves,"" the BMJ reported.

Tuesday's article is the third and last of a series published by BMJ, which has called Wakefield's study an ""elaborate fraud"" and accused him of planning to launch a business venture ""off the back of the vaccine scare.""

Following a three-year investigation, Britain's General Medical Council ruled in January 2010 that the way Wakefield conducted his research was dishonest and irresponsible. One month later, the Lancet retracted the study. In May 2010, British authorities revoked Wakefield's license to practice medicine.

Wakefield continues to insist he has done nothing wrong, and a vocal contingent of advocates for children with autism continues to support him.

In response to the latest article, the Lancet's editors said they ""strongly disagree"" with the BMJ account ""and firmly stand by our actions and decisions."" It noted that 10 of Wakefield's co-authors had their names removed from the paper after learning in 2004 that Wakefield had been paid by lawyers to help build a case against vaccine manufacturers -- a serious conflict of interest he failed to disclose -- and pointed out that Wakefield's most damning assertion was made at a separate news conference after the study was published, not in the paper that the journal published.

""From this point forward, Wakefield encouraged the media and a grassroots network of anti-vaccine advocates to believe that this vaccine may cause autism,"" the Lancet said. It added, ""At no point did we actively defend Wakefield's public statements about the link between MMR and autism.""

The journal said the Royal Free Hospital, where Wakefield worked at the time of the publication, conducted the 2004 investigation that led to a partial retraction by the paper's co-authors.

""At each stage we acted as soon as we had the evidence to do so,"" it said.

Wakefield has accused the author of the BMJ report, freelance journalist Brian Deer, of being paid by the pharmaceutical industry. In financial disclosure forms, Deer has stated that he has received no such payments.

The now-discredited paper panicked many parents and led to a sharp drop in the number of children getting the vaccine that prevents measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccination rates dropped sharply in Britain after its publication, falling as low as 80% by 2004. Measles cases have gone up sharply in the ensuing years.

In the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90% of those infected had not been vaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown, the CDC reported."

It uses figures from Public Health Scotland (PHS) which are released daily by the Scottish government on its website and during its daily briefing.

How many deaths have there been?

The figures show that 2,487 patients in Scotland have died after a positive test for Covid-19, although the actual number of deaths is known to be far higher.

Weekly data published by the National Records of Scotland (NRS) shows that up until 28 June there were 4,155 deaths registered in Scotland.

The NRS figures are higher because they include all cases where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested. The PHS figures are based on the deaths of those who had tested positive for the virus.

The first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March.

The way PHS collects figures on coronavirus deaths means there appear to be big drops in the number of deaths over the weekend and on a Monday. However, this reflects a delay in the recording of the data rather than an actual drop in deaths.

To make the data easier to interpret, this chart also shows a rolling average of the previous seven days of new deaths.

The first coronavirus case in Scotland was detected on 1 March by NHS Tayside and there are now 18,264 confirmed cases.

As of 15 June, this figure includes all those who tested positive at one of the UK government-run Regional Testing Centres.

However, the actual cumulative number of infections will be far higher, as most people who have or had Covid-19 are not tested.

This next chart shows how the highest number of new cases confirmed in a day (430) was on 31 March. New cases have mainly been declining since a second peak of 411 on 18 April.

How many tests are being carried out?

Tests in Scotland are carried out either by NHS Scotland labs or at the Regional Testing Centres.

This chart shows the total number of tests each day.

How has the share of positive test results changed?

Over time the percentage of tests coming back positive has decreased - despite more tests being carried out. This is down to the the prevalence of the virus in the community decreasing.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that one measure which can indicate whether an epidemic is under control is whether, with a comprehensive testing system, less than 5% of samples return a positive for Covid-19 over two weeks.

The last time this was above 5% in Scotland was in May. It has been below 1% since 3 June.

How many cases are there in my area?

The Scottish government gives a breakdown of confirmed cases of Covid-19 by health board.

The highest number of cases is in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, reflecting the fact it is the most populous part of Scotland.

How does Scotland compare to England?

The map below shows that fewer than five people in every 100,000 have tested positive for coronavirus across Scotland's health boards in the last week.

In other parts of the UK, however, some localised hotspots have been detected.

Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales, had the highest number in the UK, with 177 out of every 100,000 people testing positive in the week to 30 June. The spike is attributed to an outbreak at a local meat processing plant.

In England, the UK government announced on Monday it was re-imposing lockdown measures in Leicester, after it was revealed the city had 140 cases for every 100,000 people in the week to 21 June.

New figures released on Thursday show Leicester still had the highest infection rate in England, with 141 per 100,000, in the week 28 June.

The BBC's Head of Statistics, Robert Cuffe, said Bradford had the next highest case rate in England, but had seen cases fall from 73 to 46 per 100,000 people, less than a third of Leicester's total.

In Northern Ireland, seven new positive cases were reported on Friday, and one new death - taking the total to 552.

How many cases are in care homes?

The over-75s are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and more than half of all deaths from the virus in Scotland have now been in care homes.

This chart shows how many new suspected coronavirus cases have been reported each day in Scottish care homes since 11 April.

A rolling average of the previous seven days is also displayed to make the data easier to interpret.

How many people are in hospital?

The coronavirus outbreak is creating a huge load on Scotland's hospitals and its intensive care unit capacity.

This graph shows the total number of Covid-19 patients in hospitals across Scotland, with confirmed and suspected cases marked separately.

This second chart illustrates how the number of patients in intensive care appears to have peaked on 12 April and has been mainly declining since then.

Her mother posted pictures of her enjoying a pre-wedding celebration on Instagram.

Banin, whose mother is the former Iraqi dictator's eldest daughter, Raghad, enjoyed a traditional henna party on Thursday in Jordan before today's wedding to Badr Raad Mahmoud Nasser.

Popular in the eastern Mediterranean, the Gulf states, India and Pakistan, they often involve the bridal party having intricate patterns drawn on their hands, and sometimes feet, by artists using dried henna leaves, while friends and relatives perform dance routines.

She was pictured wearing a traditional dark pink Arab outfit with silver embroidery, Alarabiya.net reported, and hugging her future husband.

Banin is seen signing her marriage contract in one picture, while another shows the wedding invite, which is in the shape of an eagle.

The eagle was the state emblem of Iraq when Saddam was in power and is associated with pan-Arabism, an ideology that favours the unification of the countries of North Africa with those in West Asia and around the Arabian sea.

It's a viewpoint that Saddam Hussein advocated throughout his rule from 1979 to 2003.

He branded Banin's father, Hussein Kamel al-Majid, a traitor and had him killed in 1996 after he'd returned from exile in Jordan.

The pictures emerged after former President George W. Bush said in a rare TV interview broadcast Sunday Morning that he was shocked to learn that Saddam Hussein expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive U.S. invasion.

'You know, when he was captured, I was told that the FBI agent that talked to him – he said, 'I just didn't believe Bush',' he told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer Sunday morning.

'And it's hard for me to believe he didn't believe me.'

'We'd given an ultimatum to the Taliban and delivered,' Bush said. 'I make the point in the book, of course, that -- and Dad understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president, you better mean it.'

That line is already being interpreted on Twitter and elsewhere as a veiled slap at President Barack Obama, whose 'red line' ultimatums leveled at Syria and Iran have been seen globally as tentative and toothless."
368,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions various actors such as Saddam Hussein, Ali Mohammed, Abdul-Karim Kassem, the British-backed monarchs, the Baath party, President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and President Bush.",True,"The article discusses actions such as the execution of Saddam Hussein, the military coup in 1958, the coup in 1968 by the Baath party, the resignation of President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, the forced execution of Saddam by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and the invasion of Iraq by President Bush.",False,The article does not discuss any threats.,True,The article discusses the pattern of Iraqi leaders facing execution or assassination.,False,The article does not discuss any secrecy.,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - When Ali Mohammed was woken by gunfire celebrating the hanging of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, he thought about the lessons of history in his country where rulers tend not to die quietly in their beds.

“When I realized Saddam had been executed I was very happy,” said the 25-year-old student from the southern city of Diwaniya.

“I started watching television and it occurred to me that the end of every president in Iraq is either execution or assassination. I find that troubling.”

Even in a region where power rarely changes hands through elections, Iraq has proved a dangerous place to rule.

Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, it was created as a state by imperial Britain after World War One and ruled by British-backed monarchs until a military coup in 1958 when the king, crown prince and prime minister were all killed.

The man who staged that coup, Brigadier Abdul-Karim Kassem, was himself toppled and killed in 1963. The next president died in an air crash and was succeeded by his brother, who was exiled after a coup in 1968 by the Baath party.

President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, who resigned in 1979 when Saddam officially became president — formalizing the control Saddam had already seized — died suspiciously three years later, sparking speculation that his successor had him poisoned.

“If you think of ‘58, ‘68 and ‘79, you can now put 2006 on this list — a propagandistic show trial, a quick execution and a claim that this marks a watershed in Iraqi history,” said Toby Dodge, an Iraq expert at Queen Mary, University of London.

Saddam had intimate knowledge of assassins — as a young man he himself fired at Kassem in 1959 in a botched bid to kill the then leader. As president, Saddam took elaborate precautions, including using body doubles. The crimes for which he was executed were reprisals for a failed assassination bid in 1982.

Businessman Atheer Abdullah, 43, said Iraq, which has the world’s third biggest oil reserves and two major rivers, should be a prosperous country but had squandered its natural wealth.

“It is a cursed country with a cursed history,” he said as he waited at Baghdad airport to fly to Jordan where he now lives.

“It’s a country that two-thirds of the population flees at every regime change and the rest are in prison or killed or living in misery.”

Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has seen his fragile authority among fellow Shi’ites enhanced after he forced through Saddam’s execution just four days after the appeal court upheld his conviction over the killing and torture of Shi’ites.

But many Sunni Arabs and Saddam’s defense team have accused Maliki of political interference in the trial, which was widely criticized as unfair by international human rights groups.

Sectarian passions that have pushed Iraq toward civil war since U.S. troops overthrew Saddam in 2003 could be further inflamed by video posted on the Internet showing Shi’ite officials taunting him as he stood on the gallows on Saturday.

Iraqi state television showed film of Saddam being prepared for death, but stopped short of showing the actual moment of death. However the full video was circulated on the Internet.

Dodge said the showing of the execution “conforms to a brutal logic that Saddam Hussein used himself”.

“This isn’t even victor’s justice, this is the tawdry work of an insecure government,” Dodge said.

Amid reports that his U.S. backers are losing patience with him, Maliki has dismissed public speculation of a coup and said it would be folly to replace him.

President Bush has said the invasion of Iraq is part of a wider goal to spread democracy in the Middle East and he hailed elections in 2005 as the start of a new era.

But according to U.N. figures, more than 3,000 civilians are being killed every month in spiraling sectarian violence.

The video of the hanging inspired some discomfort even in places such as Arbil, a Kurdish city whose people, long oppressed and attacked by Saddam, had every reason to celebrate.

“It showed that we still have the culture of revenge in Iraq,” said Sara Baban, 35. “It brought to mind the scenes of executions of Iraqi officials in years gone by.”

The film was due to be screened at the Tribeca Film Festival but was pulled after a backlash from scientists and other film-makers.

However last week Hollywood star de Niro spoke out in support of the film after revealing suspicions that his 18-year-old son Elliot’s autism might be linked to the measles, mumps and rubella treatment.

Dr Wakefield, who continues his campaign against mandatory vaccination from his new home in Austin, Texas, claims that the documentary exposes the “fraud and cover-up” that has kept the truth about the dangers of the MMR vaccine suppressed. De Niro co-founded the Tribeca Film Festival and initially appeared to support the documentary being pulled.

But the Hollywood star than spoke in support of Dr Wakefield’s theory and urged scientists to reignite the debate. He said: “There’s more to this than meets the eye... as a parent of a child who has autism I am concerned.”

Dr Wakefield said: “The truth is finally coming out. This debate is not about me, it is about fraud on vaccination safety and a scandal that has escalated from a public health issue and a direct attack on freedom of speech.” The documentary, which will be shown in a selection of cinemas worldwide, highlights claims by a US scientist from the US Centers for Disease Control, that the autism risk was allegedly suppressed."
371,True,The article discusses how the FBI has expanded its domestic spying powers since 9/11 and justifies surveillance and infiltration of activist or religious communities under the banner of fighting terrorism. This suggests a potential conspiracy by the FBI to target certain groups.,True,The article mentions the FBI as the actor responsible for the expanded domestic spying powers and surveillance of certain groups.,True,"The article discusses the actions taken by the FBI, such as surveillance, infiltration, and the use of informants, to target activist, religious, and political groups.",True,The article mentions the threat of abuse of power by the FBI and the potential infringement on First Amendment rights of targeted groups.,True,"The article connects events and actions by the FBI, such as the loosening of rules, increasing secrecy demands, and the use of informants, to suggest a pattern of targeting specific groups.",True,"The article mentions increasing secrecy demands and reduced oversight opportunities, suggesting the FBI's intention to mislead the public and cover up their actions.","The FBI has vastly expanded its domestic spying powers since 9/11, often justifying surveillance and infiltration of activist or religious communities under the banner of fighting terrorism, according to a new report by the ACLU. Requirements for opening investigations into groups or individuals have been repeatedly watered-down over the past decade, and the report documents many examples of FBI investigations based on what seems to be protected First Amendment activity.

“Before 9/11, the FBI operated within rules designed to focus its investigative efforts on people reasonably suspected of wrongdoing. These rules didn’t always prevent abuse, but at least when abuse was discovered the agency could be held to account,” says Mike German, the former FBI agent who authored the ACLU report. “What has changed since 9/11 is that Congress and successive administrations loosened the rules and at the same time increasing secrecy demands reduced oversight opportunities.”

With the creation of the FBI Office of Intelligence in 2003, the FBI began a massive new intelligence-gathering project with the stated goal of preventing terrorist attacks before they occurred. With this new mandate came new powers, such as the ability to issue National Security Letters (NSLs), authorized under the Patriot Act – which author Tim Weiner’s FBI history Enemies describes as having “the combined power of a subpoena and a gag order.” The use of NSLs remains controversial today, and the constitutionality of their gag order element has been called into question by a federal judge.

Another significant tool the FBI has employed in the past decade is the use of informants to infiltrate Muslim communities. Trevor Aaronson, an investigative reporter with Al Jazeera Media Network and author of The Terror Factory: Inside the FBI’s Manufactured War on Terrorism, has previously reported that there are 10 times as many informants working for the FBI today than during the 1960s’ COINTELPRO program, often regarded as a low point in the FBI’s history. “Today the bureau has

 15,000 registered informants – and these informants are inserted into U.S. Muslim communities to gather information,” Aaronson says. “Informants have testified in court that they have spent months trolling Muslim communities without a specific target.” Of 508 federal terrorism trials in the decade after 9/11, 158 defendants were targeted through an informant, according to Aaronson, who writes in The Terror Factory that nearly all of the rest were small-time violations that didn’t pose an actual risk to U.S. citizens.

It’s not only Muslim communities that were the subject of increased suspicion – political groups and activists have been targeted as well. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund found that the FBI began investigating the Occupy movement in August 2011, even before the establishment of the encampment in New York’s Zuccotti Park. The activist and anarchist Scott Crow requested his own files from the FBI, and was given 440 heavily redacted pages, though as The New York Times reported, he had “never been convicted of anything more serious than trespassing.”

One of the most powerful new tools the FBI has had at its disposal since 9/11 is a program called Domain Management, which Aaronson says “allows the FBI to map the United States along ethnic and religious lines, and then assign agents and informants to those communities.” The ACLU report notes that the FBI’s field office in Detroit, for instance, stated in a memo that “many [State Department-designated terrorist] groups come from the Middle-East and Southeast Asia.” The memo continues: “because Michigan has a large Middle-Eastern and Muslim population, it is prime territory for attempted radicalization and recruitment by [State Department-designated] terrorist groups.”

The FBI denies that Domain Management works the way critics allege. “Domain management efforts are intended to address specific threats, not particular communities,” says spokesperson Christopher Allen. “These efforts seek to use existing, available government data to locate and better understand the communities that are potential victims of the threats.”

Asked about recent reports that the FBI increased surveillance of Syrians in the United States in a run-up to a possible air strike against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Allen says, “I would not assume the details of that story are accurate.”

Interviewing people in the U.S. based on nationality prior to a U.S. military strike would not be without precedent for the Bureau, however. In 2003, then-FBI director Robert Mueller confirmed that his agents sought to interview roughly 11,000 Iraqis living in the United States, “to protect them from hate crimes and to elicit information on any potential operations of Iraqi agents or sympathizers.”

Some of the FBI tactics employed since 9/11 seem to resemble tactics the controversial NYPD Intelligence Division has used, including mapping communities based on ethnic, racial and religious identities. Both organizations also have similar guidelines, adopted post-9/11, that allow officers to attend political meetings that are open to the public, often without disclosing their status as law enforcement. However in some cases, such as the investigation of alleged terrorist Ahmed Ferhani, the NYPD has used tactics that could be construed as entrapment, which were beyond the pale for the FBI. The ACLU is currently suing the NYPD on behalf of several Muslim plaintiffs who say NYPD policies infringe on their Constitutional rights."
372,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, President Obama, Secretary Clinton, al-Qaeda leader Zawahiri, and Ambassador Stevens.",True,"The article discusses the actions and statements of various individuals and groups, such as protesting the anti-Islamic film, issuing statements, taking responsibility for security, investigating the attacks, and implementing counter-terrorism strategies.",True,"The article mentions the attacks on the US Consulate in Benghazi and the death of four state department officials, including Ambassador Stevens.",False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey missing information or show intentions to mislead the public.,"Even as Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan continue to blast President Obama and Secretary Clinton's foreign policy successes, al-Qaeda leader Zawahiri issued another statement urging Muslims to protest the anti-Islamic film and to ""continue their opposition to American crusader Zionist aggression against Islam and Muslims"", according to Reuters.

On the eve of the second presidential debate, as Secretary Clinton took responsibility for the security in Benghazi attacks, she said, ""I want to avoid some kind of political gotcha"". Surely, this is an issue that is bound to come up.

Apparently, there was no direct linkage between the cheaply made film and the attacks on the US Consulate in Benghazi. Last week, US Congress started an investigation on the attacks in Benghazi, attempting to uncover the lapses in security which led to the death of four state department officials, including Ambassador Stevens.

As Pepe Escobar reported in Asia Times shortly after the attacks, ""In September 2012, for the first time in three months, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, aka The Surgeon, released a 42-minute video special to 'celebrate' the 11th anniversary of 9/11, finally admitting the snuffing out of his number two. His number two was none other than Abu Yahya al-Libi - targeted by one of US President Barack Obama's cherished drones in Waziristan on June 4.""

We may have a clear motive for the attack on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. According to AFP, ""Zawahiri does single out US President Barack Obama for being a 'liar' who was elected to 'trick' Muslims around the world, but who nevertheless is 'being defeated in Afghanistan'.""

In other words, contrary to what neocon advisers around Mitt Romney would have us believe, the anti-American protests across the Middle East and North Africa are partly a reflection of the effectiveness of Obama administration's counter-terrorism strategy, a senior political scientist at RAND Corporation told me.

Obama's record speaks for itself, but during Tuesday night's presidential debate he must defend it:
• National Strategy for Counter-terrorism with a target on al-Qaeda network
• Ended War in Iraq and removed troops by end of 2011
• Implemented a new strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan with re-focus on al-Qaeda
• Built an international coalition to stop a massacre in Libya and to support the overthrow the regime of Muammar Gaddafi
• Promoting democratic reform, economic development, and peace and security across the Middle East and North Africa

President Obama changed the tone and rhetoric of the ""war on terror"", yet he escalated the drone attacks, going after high value targets. After eight years of Bush-Musharraf alliance (jokingly known as the Busharraf years), Obama executed a leaner and meaner strategy.

As an anti-war candidate yet a wartime president, Obama has been caught in a Shakespearian dilemma: to Bush, or not to Bush, that is the question. He was decidedly anti-Bush in his rhetoric and policy. Ironically, his approval in Pakistan has reached the same abysmally low range, according to the latest non-partisan Pew Research data.

At Asia Society two weeks ago, the Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabanni Khar told Tom Nagorski, the incoming VP, ""This has to be our war … We are the ones who have to fight against them. As a drone flies over the territory of Pakistan, it becomes an American war again. And this whole logic of this being our fight, in our own interest is immediately put aside and again it is war which is imposed on us.""

Obama has been ""leading from the front"" in Pakistan. He can hardly be accused of passivity. On the other hand, ""leading from behind"" has been instrumental in toppling dictatorships in North Africa - Mubarak, Ben-Ali, Gaddafi, and now Assad - but it has left a power vacuum that has resulted in a blowback and anti-American protests at consulates and embassies. Additional aid spending may be able to contain it.

Instead, what we have been hearing from Romney and Ryan is the blustering claim that ""President Obama's foreign policy is unravelling"", which according to Thomas Friedman plainly does not match the evidence. Romney is trying to fit into Bush's old cowboy boots, while painting Obama to be the anti-Bush. It is like deploying an often used cultural meme: ""Democrats are wimps. Republicans are tough. Obama's been a wimp. I will be tougher… It's a real stretch.""

Mitt Romney's foreign policy speech delivered last week has received mixed reviews from all sides. Conservatives thinkers like Danielle Pletka at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) have suggested that Romney moved beyond the ""no apology"" tour, but hardly advanced a new vision for Israel-Palestinian peace, nuclear deal with Iran and a collaborative relationship with China.

Republican senator Rand Paul, who tends to be libertarian, was dismayed by Romney's comments. ""Romney chose to criticise President Obama for seeking to cut a bloated Defence Department and for not being bellicose enough in the Middle East, two assertions with which I cannot agree,"" Paul suggested.

However, according to Pew Research, Obama's image on the Muslim street after four years may have already been correlated with some of the excesses of US foreign policy. Thus, during the second town-hall debate with Mitt Romney, President Obama must fight back against the bluster at home, while trying to explain away the blowback abroad.

Biden urged leaders in Europe and the U.S. to defend democracies against dangers that he said include Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden, in remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland reported by CNBC, said Putin “has a different vision of the future,” and he accused the Russian leader of trying to “roll back decades of progress.”

“Russia is working with every tool available to them to whittle away at the edges of the European project, test for fault lines among Western nations, and return to a politics defined by spheres of influence,” Biden said.

Russia has been accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential election through the hack and release of Democratic documents.

Many U.S.-based startups with advanced reactor designs are backed by venture capitalists, not the U.S. government. Their impetus differs, too. Unlike American scientists of the 1950s and 19560s, who were locked in an atom-splitting Cold War race with the Soviet Union, they aim to combat climate change.

Nearly 50 startups working in the U.S. and Canada alone have raised more than $1.3 billion in private investment, according to a “Back to the Future” report in December by Third Way, a centrist think tank. The funding continues to increase.

How can this be? Conventional reactors, fueled by pellets of solid uranium oxide, use only 3 percent or 4 percent of uranium’s energy so the waste remains radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. But because Dewan’s reactor uses uranium in a liquid rather than solid form, it extracts 96 percent of the energy.

Yet building and maintaining nuclear power plants, even smaller ones, is costly. Low natural gas prices have made some of today’s aging U.S. plants uneconomical, prompting the closure of at least four in the last two years. (Read more about these closures.)

“They look great on paper but could be difficult to realize in practice,” he says of the advanced reactors. “A lot of projects in the past have led to disappointment.” He says reactors that don’t use the light-water design common in today’s nuclear power plants will need prototypes for testing and their private funds aren’t enough to cover the cost.

Next-gen nuclear is “absolutely doable,” says Russ Bell, senior director of new plant licensing for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group. He says many new reactor designs are safe and “extremely innovative,” but since they need to be prototyped, it will take 20 to 25 years to bring them to market.

“That sounds like a long time, but in our business, things take a while,” Bell says. For example, it could take a decade or more for the five reactors currently under construction in the U.S.—the first ones since Watts Bar Unit 1 went online in Tennessee in 1996—to go from licensing to commercial operation.

Will China Take the Lead?

China might be faster. Some U.S.-based companies are looking to China, which is rapidly expanding its use of nuclear power as a way to curb the air pollution that’s choking its cities. China currently ranks fifth in nuclear capacity, but it plans to more than double that amount soon. By 2020, it could rank third—after the U.S., still the world’s leader, and France.

Dewan says her company wants to build its molten salt reactor first in the U.S., if at all possible. She says the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is looking at advanced reactors, remains the world’s gold standard for licensing."

""This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.""The comments were approved by Soros for publication on Friday, a spokesman said.Soros, who earned fame by betting against the pound in 1992, said that with major countries such as Germany selling bonds with a negative yield, perpetual bonds would ease a looming budget crunch across the bloc.He said the EU would have to maintain its 'AAA' credit rating to issue such debt - and thus have to have tax-raising powers to cover the cost of the bonds - so suggested it could simply authorise the taxes rather than imposing them.""There is a solution,"" said Soros. ""The taxes only have to be authorized; they don't need to be implemented.""Asked about Brexit, Soros said he was particularly worried about Italy: ""What would be left of Europe without Italy?""""The relaxation of state aid rules, which favour Germany, has been particularly unfair to Italy, which was already the sick man of Europe and then the hardest hit by COVID-19 ,"" Soros said.Soros fled Hungary when the communists consolidated power in 1947 and ended up at the London School of Economics.

Carlo Maria Viganò, a former Vatican diplomat to Washington, explains in his letter that he believes the current crises befalling the US are a plot to hurt Trump’s re-election.

“In recent months we have been witnessing the formation of two opposing sides that I would call Biblical: the children of light and the children of darkness,” Viganò wrote in the letter, dated June 7.

Viganò said right now the world is battling good versus evil — “two opposing realities co-exist as eternal enemies, just as God and Satan are eternal enemies.”

“It appears that the children of darkness – whom we may easily identify with the deep state, which you wisely oppose and which is fiercely waging war against you in these days – have decided to show their cards, so to speak, by now revealing their plans.”

The archbishop claimed that “investigations” into his administration’s response to the virus outbreak will “reveal the true responsibility of those who managed the Covid emergency.”

“We will also discover that the riots in these days were provoked by those who, seeing that the virus is inevitably fading and that the social alarm of the pandemic is waning, necessarily have had to provoke civil disturbances, because they would be followed by repression which, although legitimate, could be condemned as an unjustified aggression against the population,” he wrote.

He said it’s “quite clear” that those protesting George Floyd’s death in the streets “is instrumental to the purposes of those who would like to see someone elected in the upcoming presidential elections who embodies the goals of the deep state and who expresses those goals faithfully and with conviction.”

Viganò then claimed there is a “deep church” among the clergy, just as there is a “deep state.”

Those who criticized Trump’s photo-op in front of a statue of Pope John II last week, he said, are “subservient to the deep state, to globalism, to aligned thought, to the New World Order.”

He said"" ""They invoke ever more frequently in the name of a universal brotherhood, which has nothing Christian about it, but which evokes the Masonic ideals of those want to dominate the world by driving God out of the courts, out of schools, out of families, and perhaps even out of churches.”

Viganò praised Trump for his presidency, writing: “For the first time, the United States has in you a President who courageously defends the right to life, who is not ashamed to denounce the persecution of Christians throughout the world, who speaks of Jesus Christ and the right of citizens to freedom of worship.”

“And I dare to believe that both of us are on the same side in this battle, albeit with different weapons.""

Viganò said Americans ""are mature and have now understood how much the mainstream media does not want to spread the truth but seeks to silence and distort it, spreading the lie that is useful for the purposes of their masters.""

Viganò said good people must “come together and make their voices heard” through prayer.

“In this dramatic and decisive hour for all of humanity, I am praying for you and also for all those who are at your side in the government of the United States. I trust that the American people are united with me and you in prayer to Almighty God.”

Viganò wrote: “United against the Invisible Enemy of all humanity, I bless you and the First Lady, the beloved American nation, and all men and women of good will.”"

You can read her piece on hell here.

My pious Baptist grandmother once shockingly confessed, at the ripe old age of 93, that she didn’t want to go to heaven. “Why,” we asked? “Well, I think it will be rather boring just sitting around on clouds and singing hymns all day” she answered. She had a point.

Mark Twain might have agreed with her assessment. He once famously quipped that one should choose “heaven for the climate, hell for the company”.

Most of us have some concept of heaven, even if it is one formed by movies like What Dreams May Come, The Lovely Bones, or think it involves meeting Morgan Freeman in a white room. And while not as complicated as biblical ideas about hell, the biblical concept of heaven is not particularly simple either.

In the Christian tradition, heaven and paradise have been conflated as an answer to the question “where do I go when I die?” The idea of the dead being in heaven or enjoying paradise often brings enormous comfort to the bereaved and hope to those suffering or dying. Yet heaven and paradise were originally more about where God lived, not about us or our ultimate destination.

The words for heaven or heavens in both Hebrew (shamayim) and Greek (ouranos) can also be translated as sky. It is not something that exists eternally but rather part of creation.

The first line of the Bible states that heaven is created along with the creation of the earth (Genesis 1). It is primarily God’s dwelling place in the biblical tradition: a parallel realm where everything operates according to God’s will. Heaven is a place of peace, love, community, and worship, where God is surrounded by a heavenly court and other heavenly beings.

Biblical authors imagined the earth as a flat place with Sheol below (the realm of the dead) and a dome over the earth that separates it from the heavens or sky above. Of course, we know the earth is not flat, and this three-tiered universe makes no sense to a modern mind. Even so, the concept of heaven (wherever it is located) continues in Christian theology as the place where God dwells and a theological claim that this world is not all that there is.

The other main metaphor for God’s dwelling place in the Bible is paradise. According to Luke’s version of the crucifixion, Jesus converses with the men on either side of him while waiting to die and promises the man on a neighbouring cross “today you will be with me in paradise”.

References to paradise in the Bible are likely due to the influence of Persian culture and particularly Persian Royal gardens (paridaida). Persian walled gardens were known for their beautiful layout, diversity of plant life, walled enclosures, and being a place where the royal family might safely walk. They were effectively a paradise on earth.

The garden of Eden in Genesis 2 is strikingly similar to a Persian Royal garden or paradise. It has abundant water sources in the rivers that run through it, fruit and plants of every kind for food, and it is “pleasing to the eye”. God dwells there, or at least visits, and talks with Adam and Eve like a King might in a royal garden.

In the grand mythic stories that make up the Bible, humans are thrown out of Eden due to their disobedience. And so begins a narrative about human separation from the divine and how humans find their way back to God and God’s dwelling (paradise). In the Christian tradition, Jesus is the means of return.

The Easter event that Christians celebrate around the globe at this time of year is about the resurrection of Jesus after his violent death on the cross three days earlier. Jesus’ resurrection is seen as the promise, the “first-fruits” of what is possible for all humans – resurrection to an eternal life with God. This is, of course, a matter of faith not something that can be proven. But reconciliation with God lies at the heart of the Easter story.

The last book of the Bible, Revelation, conflates the idea of heaven and paradise. The author describes a vision of a new, re-created heaven coming down to earth. It is not escapism from this planet but rather an affirmation of all that is created, material, and earthly but now healed and renewed.

This final biblical vision of heaven is a lot like the garden of Eden – complete with the Tree of Life, rivers, plants and God – although this time it is also an urban, multicultural city. In what is essentially a return to Eden, humans are reconciled with God and, of course, with one another.

Heaven or paradise in the Bible is a utopian vision, designed not only to inspire faith in God but also in the hope that people might embody the values of love and reconciliation in this world."

He was referring to the way digital currencies like Bitcoin are used to buy drugs like synthetic opioid fentanyl.

In an ""ask me anything"" session on news website Reddit, he said that the anonymity of digital currencies meant they were linked to terrorist funding and money laundering.

Some criticised him, saying he was ill-informed about the technology.

Asked by one user for his opinion on the technology, Mr Gates replied: ""The main feature of crypto-currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The government's ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.

""Right now, crypto-currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs [initial coin offerings] and crypto-currencies is super risky for those who go long.""

Veteran investor Warren Buffet has previously said that the speculative crypto-currency craze ""will come to a bad end"".

Mr Gates has not always been so cynical about Bitcoin. In 2014, in an interview on Bloomberg TV, he said that Bitcoin ""was better than currency"".

His less than enthusiastic response on Reddit did not go down well with all those participating in the debate, with some reproaching him for what they felt was an attempt to influence the market. Others suggested that he needed to look again at the Bitcoin white paper.

In the wide-ranging Reddit chat, Mr Gates told the audience that his top three goals were ""reducing both childhood death and malnutrition and ending polio"".

Mr Gates is co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which spends billions each year on education and health projects.

The foundation has also sponsored the development of blockchain - the technology that underpins crypto-currenices - for merchants in Kenya.

Microsoft is also looking to integrate blockchain-based technology for verifying digital identity.

The rise in value of crypto-currency has prompted governments around the world to look more closely at its impact on economies and citizens.

While the technology underlying it is often praised, there are concerns about how it could disrupt the economy as well as its links to cyber-crime and money laundering.

The UK's Treasury Committee is currently investigating the impact of such currencies."

• Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said that former President Barack Obama ""should have kept his mouth shut"" rather than criticizing President Donald Trump's coronavirus response.
• ""I think it's a little bit classless, frankly, to critique an administration that comes after you,"" McConnell told Lara Trump.
• These comments followed Obama saying on a private conference call that COVID-19 response has been ""an absolute chaotic disaster.""
• Trump has since promoted an ""Obamagate"" conspiracy theory on Twitter but refused to explain what he means.

Mitch McConnell on Monday excoriated former President Barack Obama for disparaging the United States' coronavirus response under President Donald Trump.

In a conversation with Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, on a campaign live stream, the senate majority leader asserted that Obama ""should have kept his mouth shut"" instead of being critical of the steps taken so far to guide the nation through a pandemic that has infected at least 1.35 million Americans and caused at least 80,897 deaths.

""I think it's a little bit classless, frankly, to critique an administration that comes after you. You had your shot, you were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bush's set up — of not critiquing the president who comes after you — is a good tradition,"" McConnell said, according to CNN.

McConnell lashed out after Obama characterized the Trump administration's COVID-19 response as an ""absolute chaotic disaster,"" based on an audio recording obtained by Yahoo News. These remarks were made during a private call with 3,000 former members of the Obama administration, with the country's 44th president encouraging them to work for ex-vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden.

Three former White House staffers who were on the conference call have confirmed to CNN that Obama was critical of the Trump administration's haphazard and lackluster actions to stem the virus's spread.

""What we're fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy — that has become a stronger impulse in American life. And by the way, we're seeing that internationally as well. It's part of the reason why the response to this global crisis has been so anemic and spotty,"" Obama said, according to CNN.

The former president went on to say: ""It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset — of 'what's in it for me' and 'to heck with everybody else' — when that mindset is operationalized in our government.""

McConnell also falsely blamed the Obama administration for not leaving the Trump administration with ""any kind of game plan"" for something like this. In fact, Obama administration officials prepared a comprehensive pandemic response playbook that the Trump administration ignored.

Obama also said the ""rule of law is at risk"" after the Department of Justice's recent decision to drop its case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Trump, who frequently belittles his predecessor, was asked about some of his tweets on Sunday that appeared to accuse Obama of some type of conspiracy.

""Obamagate. It's been going on for a long time. It's been going on from before I even got elected, and it's a disgrace that it happened,"" he said, per CNN.

When asked about the conspiracy theory at a Monday press conference, Trump replied: ""You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody.""

The theory claims that Obama tried to undermine Trump's presidency by plotting an FBI investigation into Flynn. However, there is no public evidence to back up this claim."

In Germany, the period of the ‘30s and first half of the ‘40s, was the first time electronic mass communication was used to propagandize the masses for control.

The evil Nazi genius, Joseph Goebbels, is arguably the leading modern propagandist.

His basic propaganda to defeat the Communist Party was to present it as being evil and the Nazi Party as righteous without using any real rationale, logic or facts.

His theory: “If you repeat a lie often enough people will believe it and you will even come to believe it yourself.”

He also said, “The bigger the lie the more it will be believed,” and, “There is no need for propaganda to be rich in intellectual content.”

Americans watching cable news networks seem to see this type of propaganda in play every day. Does this system work? Yes.

Goebbels was able to talk a Christian nation into justifying the murder of millions of people.

During the night of the long knives and shortly thereafter when Hitler had Ernst Rohm (head of the SA – or Storm Battallion) murdered, Goebbels propaganda machine exposed his evil homosexual lifestyle which they had known about for years and had kept it covered up because he previously benefited them.

We who believe in peace in the world must get behind a strong United Nations to convince the US that their actions and foreign policies are destroying the world. I have lost complete respect for their sanity. I say this as a 61-year-old female nana of four from Canada. The suffering of women and children all over the world and their looks of pain are never far from my mind. The backroom dealings with a bunch of rich, old men seem to be dictating the fate of so many innocent people who deserve to live their lives too. - Sherry Smith

The US is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in Somalia, or any other country for that matter, that is harboring terrorists. These people are responsible for killing American citizens, as well as many other people from all over the world. We cannot let these people get away with these crimes. The entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists, Europe included. If the world does not stand up now, we will have a much, much bigger problem in the years to come. No one stood up to Hitler until it was too late, we can't afford to do the same thing again. - Richard Mattis

Pre-emptive strikes that kill innocent civilians and destabilize economies only encourage more people to believe violence and terror are solutions. Many in the US find President Bush's foreign policy deplorable. - Dorothea Izzo

While I am not confident of the overall wisdom of launching these attacks, I've no doubt that those on the receiving end of the attacks richly deserve them. - Tom

The US gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism. Terrorists are killing defenseless men, women, children and our freedom. How do you bring terrorists in for peace talks? Let history speak for itself. Europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns, killing civilians indiscriminately. We do not want to see history repeat itself, therefore we will stop them when and where ever we find them. In doing so, we may succeed in saving lives here and abroad. - Frank Penna

My friends in Germany, wake up and smell the jihad. Just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country, reeling from a century of warfare, and understandably wishing for peace in this world, being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat. These are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the Middle East, Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, England, Spain, Thailand, and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet. Eradicating these people, especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders, as was done in Somalia just now, is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace. Somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical Islamic threat. Only a fool loves war, but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him. Godspeed to the Ethiopian army. More civilized nations, especially the ""blind mice"" of Europe, had better come on board before it's too late. Germany: you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason. - Ron Jendry

I believe it was the Islamist and warlords that destabilized Somalia, not the USA, which killed a known terrorist, one that could have easily struck any of the EU embassies or nations. I believe that the EU has lost perspective here and that it is easier for the EU to criticize than it is to take action or stand by a known ally. - J. Becher"

All of Disney's ""cast members,"" as it calls park employees, have been offered immunity tests and vaccinations since the company first heard of the outbreak Jan. 7, Hymel said. Those who have been in close contact with infected employees are put on paid leave until their immunity can be established.

Of the five employees at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, three have fully recovered and returned to work, and two remain off, said Dr. Pamela Hymel, the chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

A recent measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California includes five park employees who were infected, officials said Tuesday.

Oregon became the latest state affected Tuesday when state officials confirmed that a Eugene man in his 40s had contracted the disease after visiting Disney parks.

Orange County has confirmed 18 cases there in the past month, though six were not connected to the theme parks, said its health agency spokeswoman Deanne Thompson.

At nearby Huntington Beach High School, at least 23 unvaccinated students have been sent home after a student was confirmed to be infected with measles.

Students without a measles vaccination were told to stay home until Jan. 29 to avoid a spread of the disease that has symptoms including fever and a blotchy body rash.

State law requires schoolchildren to get vaccinated to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, but parents can get an exemption by signing a personal belief waiver.

Many parents who reject vaccines or delay them fear there are links between the vaccines and medical conditions such as autism. Numerous studies have dismissed an autism link.

""It is at large in the community now, and particularly infants too young to be immunized, people with other health conditions and, of course, people who aren't immunized need to be very concerned,"" Thompson said.

She added that unvaccinated people ""really should rethink that and consider getting vaccinated."""

The numbers were released via email Monday afternoon, as the province has curtailed its live briefings to one a week, with the next to take place Wednesday.

According to the latest figures, 16,151 people have been tested, an increase of 169 in the last day.

One positive test result on Saturday is not considered a new case, as it came from an Eastern Health employee who previously had the virus but has since recovered.

That person's close contacts, both professional and personal, were notified and tested out of an abundance of caution, according to the provincial government.

All of those tests came back negative, said the government Monday.

""The employee has subsequently tested negative on two occasions. The employee and any close contacts have been advised that it is safe to return to work and they no longer have to self-isolate,"" reads the media release.

Since March, 261 people in the province have been infected. Three people died and there have been 258 recoveries.

Barring a surge in new cases in the coming days, Newfoundland and Labrador is set to enter Alert Level 2 on Thursday.

That will allow a myriad of businesses to reopen, such as gyms and bars. Recreational facilities like playgrounds will also reopen, and daycares can move to full capacity.

That brings the state’s total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases to more than 4,000, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered a statewide stay-at-home order in late March, and those restrictions have been gradually lifted over the last several weeks. The state is currently in the fourth and final stage of Little’s reopening plan, with gatherings of more than 50 people allowed.

However, the numbers of people becoming infected have climbed as more businesses reopened and more people resumed normal activity levels. One outbreak in the Boise area was tied to young people going to downtown bars as they reopened. Health districts in the Twin Falls region and in eastern Idaho have all seen a recent increase in COVID-19 cases in people under the age of 50, Boise State Public Radio reported.

“They’re going out to the bars, they’re going out and having a good time,” state epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn said at last week’s City Club of Boise forum. “They don’t perceive themselves at risk of severe disease.”

Little has repeatedly said that he would consider renewing some restrictions if cases spike in order to prevent Idaho’s health care system from becoming overwhelmed. But last week he suggested any such decisions could be made on a regional, rather than statewide, basis.

The White House has identified “14-day downward trajectories” in both confirmed cases and test positivity rates as key criteria for reopening. Idaho met those recommendations when the reopening process began. The recent spike, however, means the state would not qualify for reopening under the federal guidance. The 14-day trend in new cases has more than doubled, climbing from just under 43 to nearly 87 new cases a day, according to numbers from The COVID Tracking Project. Idaho’s 14-day trend in the testing positivity rate has also increased from about 3% to 6%."

Throughout the song he repeats the line:

“Did you ever stop to notice

 This crying Earth, these weeping shores?”

I think this is him describing people ignoring the signs and chosing not to notice how the condition of the earth is deteriorating. He also talks about other global issues that people chose to ignore like war and poverty. In the middle of the song he says:

“What have we done to the world?

 Look what we’ve done

 What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?”

I think this is him referring to God sending his only son to forgive the world’s sins. He is saying that we have forgotten about this sacrifice and have chosen not to respect it by not taking care of what God has given us. At the end of the song he makes several references to nature and Christianity. He first says:

“What about nature’s worth?

 (Ooh)

 It’s our planet’s womb

 (What about us?)

 What about animals?

 (What about it?)

 Turned kingdoms to dust”

This is another instance of him talking about people forgetting about nature and animals and essentially destroying them. A few lines later he says:

“What about The Holy Land?

 (What about it?)

 Torn apart by creed?

 (What about us?)”

“What about Abraham?

 (What about us?)

 What about death again?

 (Ooh)”

I think that these are both examples of Michael Jackson referring to Christianity. When he says that The Holy Land has been torn apart by creed, I believe he is referring to the conflict in Israel between the Palestinians and the Israelites. He is questioning peoples faith if they are having war over and destroying The Holy Land. In the second verse, I think that he is alluding to the Book of Genesis and the Blessing of Abraham. He is reminding people that God blessed all people of earth through Abraham and when he says “What about death again?” he is referring to the rapture or the return of Christ. Overall with the mention of Abraham and death again in this verse, I think his message is that there will be consequences if we forget the blessings that God has given us.

393,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions various actors such as the European Parliament, music and news companies, Google, Facebook, Wyclef Jean, Murray Head, Paul McCartney, Agence France-Presse, culture ministers, US tech giants, online freedom activists, German liberal MEP Nadja Hirsch, traditional media, Sammy Ketz, European Council, European Commission, European film-makers, Mike Leigh, Jacques Audiard, Green lawmaker Helga Trupel, newspapers, magazines, and news agencies.",True,"The article discusses the actions of the European Parliament voting on a copyright law, lobbying efforts, supporting or opposing the draft law, proposing amendments, resisting the draft law, warning about the consequences, backing the draft law, starting negotiations, and urging lawmakers to pass certain measures.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"The European Parliament votes Wednesday on a highly complex online copyright law that has split natural political bedfellows and pitted music and news companies against Google and Facebook.

EU lawmakers are divided on the issue even within their usual ideological camps, and a jamboree of lobbying around the Strasbourg session has underscored divisions in the creative community.

Haitian recording star Wyclef Jean was in town to oppose the law -- putting him on the side of Silicon Valley giants and activists for internet freedom.

But British singer Murray Head was also there, backing efforts to update EU copyright law for the first time in 15 years and ensure creators are paid fairly in a digital world.

This put Head on the side of other greats such as Beatles frontman Paul McCartney -- who wrote in support of the draft law -- and of global news organisations, including Agence France-Presse.

Indeed, the ambitious draft provoked one of the most intense lobbying wars in EU history, with both sides spending lavishly on advertising and email campaigns to defend their corner.

The vote will take place at about 1000 GMT after a flurry of media stunts and celebrity appearances to help persuade MEPs.

The outcome remains highly uncertain with stakeholders lobbying MEPs intensely behind the scenes even as lawmakers debated the draft in the chamber.

Rejected in July, members on all sides of the issue have proposed a huge series of amendments hoping to calm the fears of advocates of internet freedom who helped sink an earlier draft.

""We should not accept a world where a handful of multinational companies capture most of the value generated by works created by others,"" eight culture ministers, including France's Francoise Nyssen and Spain's Jose Guirao Cabrera, wrote in editorial.

The draft has been resisted by US tech giants as well as online freedom activists, with some campaigners warning it could spell the end of viral ""memes"" or jokes.

They also fear that automatic filters to prevent users sharing content subject to copyright could be misused to censor political messages or other forms of free expression.

German liberal MEP Nadja Hirsch warned: ""We are dealing with more and more anti-democratic forces. That's why we refuse upload filters. We don't want to open Pandora's box.""

Backing the draft are traditional media in urgent search of revenue at a time when web users get much content for free, and advertising revenue is siphoned away by search and aggregation platforms.

""All that we want is that they pay so we can continue to gather news,"" said Sammy Ketz, veteran AFP reporter and author of an influential editorial entitled: ""A question of life and death.""

""Who will fight fake news and conspiracy theories if journalists do not?"" he demanded.

If adopted, MEPs will be able to start negotiations with the EU Council representing the 28 member states which already reached a compromise on the issue in May.

These closed-door discussions, which also include the European Commission, are known in EU jargon as ""trilogues"" and can take several months before any compromise is put to a fresh vote.

Proponents of the reform would like a law before the European elections in May 2019, when many fear an influx of eurosceptic MEPs with little use for it.

The lobbying battle is over two parts of the planned law.

The first is Article 13, which would make platforms like Google-owned YouTube legally liable if their users share copyrighted material, to prevent content producers being ripped off.

At the Venice film festival last week, 165 European film-makers, including Mike Leigh and Jacques Audiard, urged EU lawmakers to pass this measure.

Critics say the change will lead in effect to blanket censorship of platforms that have become an online hub for creativity as well as the prime source of entertainment -- at the expense of TV -- for younger generations.

""Upload filters or anything else that restricts this will stop artists from making and creating the future,"" said former Fugees star Wyclef Jean.

But Green lawmaker Helga Trupel criticised web freedom activists, saying web giants have shown they are better able to profit from a copyright free-for-all than smaller content creators.

""Their understanding of freedom is an unlimited one,"" she told a news conference, which means that ""only the big win.""

The second key disputed provision is Article 11. This would create a so-called ""neighbouring right"", meaning that newspapers, magazines, and news agencies would receive a fee when web services link to their stories."

The ex-National Security Agency contractor told podcast host Joe Rogan that Lunar landing conspiracy theorists are wrong about the Apollo missions being part of a global hoax.

This debunking was in response to conspiracy theories that the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 - which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year - was all a con.

Nasa won the space race to the Moon on July 20, 1969 and 650million people watched televised footage of astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on its surface.

But an American man called Bill Kaysing started the moon-hoax conspiracy, publishing a pamphlet called We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, which included lots of conspiracy theories.

Snowden, 36, is a former contractor who spent seven years working for the NSA and CIA in America.

He became a whistleblower in 2013, leaking highly classified details of secret surveillance programmes by US intelligence agencies.

Snowden told comedian Rogan that he had snooped for evidence of aliens, chemtrails and other popular conspiracy theory topics.

Chemtrails are trails of clouds seen streaking across the sky from aircraft.

But to some conspiracy theorists, they are really governments secretly releasing harmful substances in the air via planes.

Snowden has recently written about such beliefs in his memoir, Permanent Record, revealing his life story for the first time.

He told Rogan that in it: ""I talk about aliens and chemtrails and things like that, and the fact that there's no evidence for that.

""I went looking on the network. I know Joe, you want there to be aliens.""

Snowden told him: ""There probably are, right? But the idea that we're hiding them - if we are hiding them - I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups.

""So, if it's hidden, and it could be hidden, it's hidden really damn well, even from people who are on the inside.""

Snowden explains in his memoir, that ""for the record, as far as I could tell, aliens have never contacted Earth, or at least they haven't contacted US intelligence.""

He told Rogan's podcast on Wednesday that ""everyone wants to believe in conspiracy theories, because it makes life make sense.

""It helps us believe somebody is in control, somebody is calling the shots.

""There are real conspiracies, but they don't typically have tens of thousands of people working on them, unless you're talking about the existence of the intelligence community itself.""

In Permanent Record, Snowden also says, ""in case you are wondering: yes, man really did land on the moon. Climate change is real. Chemtrails are not a thing.""

Snowden lives in Russia, where he was granted asylum, to avoid prosecution in the US.

Many civil rights activists see him as a hero, but American authorities want him to stand trial for espionage.

The United States has sued to prevent Snowden profiting from his book because he did not seek intelligence agency review of its contents."

His Open Society Foundation, which operates in 37 countries, has nearly $20billion to supporting education, public health and human rights causes in developing countries since it was established in 1993. However Turkish President Erdogan said one of its founders in Turkey, Hakan Altinay, supported jailed rights activist Osman Kavala in trying to overthrow the government through mass protests in Istanbul in 2013.

Mr Altinay is among 13 people who were detained nearly two weeks ago but Mr Soros’s foundation has rejected the “baseless claims” and said the president’s comments made it impossible for them to continue work in the country. In a speech last week, Mr Erdogan linked the arrests 10 days ago to Mr Soros, who is based in America. The Turkish President told a meeting of local administrators: “The person [Kavala] who financed terrorists during the Gezi incidents is already in prison. “And who is behind him? The famous Hungarian Jew Soros.

Mr Erdogan went on to accuse Mr Soros of spending his billions of dollars by dividing countries. He said: “This is a man who assigns people to divide nations and shatter them. “He has so much money and he spends it this way.“ All but one of those arrested were released after European Union countries and the United States expressed concerns about their cases.

Western allies of Ankara have criticised President Erdogan for the tens of thousands of arrests and crackdowns since the protests. The Open Society Foundation also said their work was being hampered by a renewed investigation by Turkish authorities into the 2013 clashes which became known as the Gezi Park protests. The demonstrations were one of the biggest challenges to the authoritarian President Erdogan’s 15-year rule. Mr Kavala, who has been detained for more than a year, said he is still waiting for indictments to be put to him so that he could prove his innocence."

The conspiratorial or paranoid style is very much alive in our political discourse. Naturally, it's not just a right-wing phenomenon.

There's also the ChemTrail crowd that thought the Republican government used planes to dump toxins on liberal areas to make us sick, disrupt pregnancies, and sap our will to resist. Etc., etc., So yeah, that paranoid style is alive on the fringes of the American left.

But with the Right, it's a bit different. The paranoid and conspiratorial style is much more mainstream, especially with Beck and Fox. On Fox, there are shadowy links between Soros, the Tides Foundation, and other liberal causes that aim to bring America down. Obama is at once fascist and a socialist.

Banks lend us money to buy houses and start businesses.

Insurance companies help protect us from risks. Professional investors grow our savings and manage our pensions for the future.

But many of us will remember what happens when finance isn’t managed properly. When the global financial crisis hit a decade ago, panic spread through a weak banking system, plunging the economy into a deep recession.

One million people lost their jobs. And wages, adjusted for inflation, are only now returning to the levels last seen 12 years ago.

Financial crisis are extremely costly. That’s why the Bank of England has been fixing the fault lines that caused the crisis. Our financial system is now safer, simpler and fairer.

But the Bank isn’t just focused on fixing the mistakes of the past, we’re also anticipating the challenges of the future.

And some of the biggest risks facing the financial system are the result of climate change.

Floods, freezes and heatwaves have caused disruption to everyday lives and livelihoods.

In the past three decades, the amount paid out each year by the insurance industry due to extreme weather has ballooned from £8 billion to a record £60 billion.

And the uninsured property destroyed by extreme weather has reached over £200 billion a year.

Climate change is real and it will become even more costly unless we act.

The good news is that the financial sector can be part of the solution.

The UK was the first country in the world to commit to “net zero” emissions – which is what will be required to stop the historic rise in global temperatures that are causing the climate crisis.

To achieve this goal, every country, every company, every bank, every investor, and every pension fund around the world will need to make some big changes.

As they do, the financial sector must be there to support the changes to a newer, much greener economy.

In order to achieve this, our plan is to focus on three “Rs”.

First, Reporting. Companies will need to publicly report their carbon emissions today and their plans for reducing them tomorrow. This will help banks, pension funds, insurance companies - all of us - make better decisions

Second, Risk Management. Banks will need to manage the risks that a move to a net zero economy poses.

Through the Bank of England’s “stress test” - the first of its kind in the world - banks will need to understand which of their borrowers are ready for the transition to a green economy and which ones will struggle.

The Bank of England is encouraging companies to think about how the effects of climate change, such as floods, and government policies to stop climate change - such as putting a price on pollution - might change their businesses and their income. And then we’re asking them to share this information so that their customers, banks and investors can make better decisions.

And third, return. Investment funds, banks and insurers who invest your money should explain how these investments will affect your children’s climate. We are working with a group of companies to develop measures of how different investments contribute to climate change, or reduce its effects.

They can then share this information so that you can tell these investors how you want your pensions and savings invested.

The UK, with the world’s largest financial sector, will lead the world’s transition to net zero.

The UK has been at the forefront of innovation for centuries. It was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, including the energy revolution that brought unimagined progress.

398,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Dr. Andrew Wakefield as the lead researcher of the flawed study.,True,The article discusses the unethical actions of Dr. Wakefield and his co-investigators.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"More than any other research, it was a study published in British medical journal the Lancet in 1998 that helped foster the persisting notion that childhood vaccines can cause autism. On Tuesday, that flawed study, led by gastroenterologist Dr. Andrew Wakefield, was officially retracted by the journal's editors  a serious slap and rare move in the world of medicine.

""It has become clear that several elements of the 1998 paper by Wakefield et al are incorrect, contrary to the findings of an earlier investigation,"" wrote the Lancet editors in a statement issued online.

Wakefield's work was the subject of what was almost certainly the longest medical-misconduct inquiry in British history, which concluded on Jan. 28. The U.K. General Medical Council, which licenses British doctors, found that Wakefield and two co-investigators had acted unethically and shown ""callous disregard"" for the 12 children in the study, which linked symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal trouble in eight of the children with their exposure to the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Among other failures, Wakefield neglected to disclose that he was a paid adviser in legal cases by families suing vaccine manufacturers for harm to their children. It appears that he also handpicked the children for the study, rather than encountering them as consecutive patients at his clinic  another deception cited by the Lancet editors. And there were other lapses in the way Wakefield recruited research subjects  in one instance, paying children at his son's birthday party to give blood.

The three doctors cited by the council may be stripped of their right to practice medicine in Britain. But the findings of the inquiry come several years after the 1998 study had already been discredited and after 10 other co-authors had renounced its findings.

Now, with the formal retraction of Wakefield's paper, the question is whether the vaccine theory of autism may finally be put to rest. That seems unlikely. Since 1998, numerous studies have found no link between vaccines and autism, and yet parents' fears have endured. Indeed, vaccination rates in the U.K., which dropped after the publication of Wakefield's paper, never fully rebounded, and measles cases have taken off in Britain, leaping from 56 in 1998 to 1,370 by 2008. Cases have also risen in the U.S.

The vaccine fears persist in part because parents often notice the first autism symptoms around age 2, when many childhood vaccines are given. Most autism experts believe this is purely coincidental and that in many cases, parents have missed subtle signs of autism  such as a baby's failure to point and use gestures to communicate  that may have emerged before vaccination.

The vaccine theory also offers an appealingly simple explanation for a devastating and confusing ailment that seems to arrive like a thief in the night. It has been diagnosed with ever greater frequency, and the number of vaccines given in childhood has also grown in the past 20 years, making it easy target for blame. Experts believe that much of the increase in autism spectrum disorders owes to better detection, less stigma and broader definitions of autism, but this explanation fails to satisfy afflicted families.

Another reason that Wakefield's spurious conclusions had so much staying power was that his study focused on gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism. Many autistic children have constipation, stomach pain and feeding issues that remain poorly understood. Says autism advocate and blogger Katie Wright, a Wakefield loyalist: ""He was the first doctor to take this concern seriously and research why so many autistic children develop severe GI disease.""

Wakefield, who is associated with the Thoughtful House Center for Children, an autism center in Austin, Texas, could not be reached for comment. He maintains a devoted circle of supporters, several of whom appeared with Wakefield on Jan. 28 in London, where the doctor traveled to hear the General Medical Council's findings.

For now, the standoff over the vaccine theory shows no signs of dissipating. Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious disease at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and author of Autism's False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure, says he has received hundreds of grateful letters from parents of children with autism thanking him for debunking the autism-vaccine connection. But he has also received death threats from families on the other side, who are a strong but committed minority. ""It's easy to scare people, but it's extremely hard to un-scare them,"" says Offit.

Around 25% of the eurozone’s government bonds carry a negative yield meaning investors are paying for the privilege of lending money to governments.

On April 8, Switzerland became the first country to ever issue 10-year debt carrying a yield less than zero. And in the secondary market, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Austria already have all their short-term debt trading with yields at less than zero. The benchmark 10-year German bond is also approaching a zero yield, currently standing at 0.073%.

But even as more eurozone members move into negative territory, investors are eager to buy, as the Spanish negative yielding short-term debt issuance showed on Tuesday.

Read: How to stop worrying about negative yields and learn to love them.

Meanwhile, in the U.S. mixed economic data that indicate soft growth and missed inflation targets have led the “data-dependent” Federal Reserve to shy away from a June rate hike. Still, the market is expecting a rate hike sometime later in 2015, which has helped keep Treasury yields in check.

The combination of these competing forces has altered the landscape government bond yields in unprecedented ways, creating anomalies in the market place.

For instance, Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond, which carries a BBB rating, would indicate that it is riskier debt than the much-higher AA+-rated 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, But the Spanish bond yield stands at 1.485%, 41.5 basis points below the Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, yield.

This puts the Fed in a tough spot, as it is difficult to unwind QE in the U.S. when it has only just started in Europe. Raising rates in the U.S. may only exacerbate the yield differentials between Treasurys and the eurozone.

With the disparity between the strength of some economies, like the U.S., over others persisting, such abnormalities may become more pronounced.

It is the sort of market that has Nobel laureates like Robert Shiller thinking about bond bubbles.

Some 80 million lives of children under the age of 1 are at risk, according to a report from the WHO and partners.

The report, which was compiled by UNICEF, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and GAVI, showed that more than half of the 129 countries where vaccination data was available, reported moderate, severe or total suspensions of services during the months of March and April.

""Disruption to immunization programs from the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases like measles,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.

""We must not forget the dozens of lifesaving vaccines that already exist and must continue to reach children everywhere,"" Tedros wrote on Twitter.

UNICEF stated there had been major delays in vaccine deliveries due to the global lockdown and the significant reduction in flights that came with it.

More than 40 of Africa's 54 nations have closed their borders, though some allow cargo and emergency transport. Officials added that 46 campaigns to immunize children against polio had been put on hold in 38 countries, most of which were in Africa. Measles campaigns have been brought to a temporary halt in 27 countries.

Experts recommend routine immunizations of all children before the age of 2.

The WHO reluctantly recommended a temporary halt to polio immunization campaigns in April. Wiping out polio requires more than 90% of children to be immunized.

At least 12 countries in Africa have recorded polio outbreaks this year.

The US president embellished the quote from Fox News’ Mark Levin to also assert “this is a corrupt process” and added a false reaction from Republican senator Doug Collins, claiming he replied: “Very much so!”

Mr Collins did nod to indicate his agreement, however his raised eyebrows suggested some shock at Mr Levin’s comparing the president to those responsible for the most infamous terror attack in American history.

Mr Trump is currently on trial in the senate, accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is the third US president to be impeached.

“I don’t believe this is ever happened before in American history,” Mr Levin claimed. “The president is denied due process. I’m not talking about the Bill of Rights, I’m talking about the due process past presidents have had… basic Magna Carta-type due process that people are supposed to get.

“The president gets less due process than the terrorists on 9/11 get. They get habeas corpus rights and all these other… the president gets no rights, no consideration. The Republicans, no rights. You just told me you couldn’t call a single witness.”

All of the 19 terrorists aboard planes died during the 9/11 attacks. Several others involved in planning the terror strike are serving life sentences or potentially facing the death penalty, with some suspects having been subjected to torture at Guantanamo Bay and CIA black sites. Several were detained for years without being formally charged.

While Mr Trump and Republicans have not been able to call witnesses during the impeachment inquiry, they were able to cross-examine the witnesses that were called.

The White House has also been able to block any of the documents and witnesses requested by Democrats, with Mr Trump notably saying he would use executive privilege to block former national security adviser John Bolton’s testimony.

It is not the first strange claim Mr Trump has made about 9/11.

The president has previously boasted that his building was the tallest in downtown Manhattan after the World Trade Centre was destroyed. He also claimed to have been a first responder despite also purporting to have seen thousands of Muslims celebrating the attack in New Jersey.

On Sunday, loyal Trump defender Lindsey Graham claimed Mr Trump’s biggest concern about the impeachment trial was that it posed a threat to the sanctity of the presidency.

“He thinks it’s a threat to the presidency,” Mr Graham told Fox News. “The one thing he talks to me constantly about is ‘what does the next president do after this, if it is successful?’ He does not want to legitimise attack[s] on the presidency.”

Meanwhile, Mr Trump was addressing the American Farm Bureau in Austin on Sunday, where he continued to rage against impeachment proceedings.

“We’re achieving what no administration has ever achieved before,” Mr Trump claimed. “And what do I get for it? I get impeached by these radical left lunatics.”"

Security Council, and the inspectors.",True,"The article discusses the actions of the actors, such as the inspections regime for Iraq, Saddam's behavior, and the actions of the U.N. Security Council.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"President Barack Obama correctly has pointed out that the impending Iran nuclear deal depends for success upon United Nations inspections. He also said, incorrectly, that “…Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history.”

The President seems not to remember the inspection regime for Iraq following the 1991 Kuwait war. And that inspection regime did not work, for reasons that included both Saddam’s behavior and that of the U.N. Security Council.

We learned a great deal about Saddam’s strategy and tactics toward the inspectors following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, because Saddam and his senior aides told us about it.

In April 1991, the Security Council linked removal of Iraqi sanctions to Saddam Hussein’s verifiable accounting for all his weapons of mass destruction and acceptance of a monitoring regime to assure, in perpetuity, that he did not recreate these capabilities.

Note that the sanctions stayed on until the inspectors reported positively.

The Iraq inspectors were given the ability—on paper-- to go anywhere, anytime, with any equipment. They could seize documents, interview people, operate aircraft for transportation (and with sensors), and, basically anything else the Chairman of UNSCOM (the special Iraq WMD inspection team) and the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency decided was necessary.

The dynamic was that after the inspectors could verify that Iraq had met the Security Council resolution goals, then Council members would lift sanctions.

The reality on the ground was quite a different matter. Despite the broad authorities written by the Security Council, inspectors faced delays, deceptions and threats.

Inspectors knew they only had as much authority as the Security Council would back up. Saddam knew this as well.

Saddam’s top goal was to get out of sanctions. He gave up as little as possible to satisfy the Security Council. And it was the Council, not just the inspectors that he was dealing with.

The Security Council consensus may have been strong when the inspections resolution was written, but the will of the Council decayed from that day forward.

Iraq’s cooperation with inspections was grudging and sporadic. The process took years. Even when Saddam was largely compliant, the inspectors were uncertain about it, even with all the access they had.

In the meantime, Russia was pushing Saddam’s case. Moscow worked to put more compliant inspectors on the inspection teams. It constantly challenged the credibility of inspector assessments and helped shift the burden of proof onto the inspectors.

It was also clear Moscow aided Iraq in preparing for so-called surprise inspections.

Iraq paid well for the help. Among documents published in the Iraq Survey Group’s 2004 report on Iraq’s WMD programs (informally known as the Duelfer Report), was a complete list of oil allocations given by Iraq under the U.N.’s Oil-for-Food Program to a range of beneficiaries. Included were many senior Russian officials and offices, e.g. the Presidential Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

According to key Saddam lieutenants these allocations and other direct cash payments produced the desired effects.

Saddam also knew some Council members would not agree to military actions against him.

This confidence was borne out in December 1998 when UNSCOM reported that after years of effort, it could not complete the tasks given to it by the Security Council under the conditions Iraq permitted.

The Council could not agree on a response that would compel Iraqi compliance and President Bill Clinton (with support from Britain) ordered a limited four-day bombing campaign. That was all. Oh, and the inspectors left and Saddam did not let them back in until November 2002 when the build-up to war was clear.

So what does all this portend for Iran? Well, one thing implied in the framework agreement made public so far is that the U.N. Security Council will have to re-impose sanctions in response to inspector reports of non-compliance or non-cooperation or anything else.

I don’t think anyone believes Security Council members (certainly not Russia) will pre-authorize their vote to impose sanctions on the basis of some assessment by the IAEA. So talk of automatically re-imposing sanctions should be examined very carefully.

Nothing Iran has done or said seems to suggest they have given up the desire for a nuclear weapon capability. At best, it may be deferred. They can work the Russians and others over time. They have played a long game so far.

Russia --and others—also may have very different incentives in a year or two, or more.

This deal may be better than going to war. It’s not clear so far that it’s better than trying to sustain sanctions already in place, vs. re-imposing sanctions later when Iran elects to move further toward nuclear weapons.

In any case, it’s clear our ability to shape an outcome has become limited."

The fake war in Albania was meant to not only distract the public but to not let a sex scandal influence the presidential election that was quickly approaching. Creating a war united the American public and boosted patriotism among Americans. Although it was ethically wrong to fabricate a war as a distraction, the reason was that it would be better for the American public.

Having the ability to create a fake war opens up many dangerous doors. Ethically, it is wrong to lie to millions of people about what is going on in the world. The media is what influences and shapes public opinion. Therefore, by feeding fake stories to the public, you are altering their opinions. The public deserves to know the truth about what is going on the world so their opinions can influence a decision that is best for them. The possibility of fabricating news will change history and soon it will be unclear what is true and what is not.

Members have the media have historically attempted to deceive the public for a number of different reasons. Janet Cooke fabricated a story called “Jimmy’s World” where she made up an 8-year-old heroin addict. This and many cases in which reporters lied about their sources and stories have made the media increasingly unreliable to the public. If reporters continue to fabricate stories, lie about sources, and alter public opinion then the media will become completely unreliable.

I think the situation should have been handled very differently. A scandal as minor as the sex scandal the president was involved with should have been transparent. If the public saw that the president was attempting to be honest and publicly apologized, the scandal would have soon blown over. If it ever got out that the White House fabricated an entire story just as a distraction, the repercussions would have been much worse than if the president would have just apologized.

This issue impacts the very existence of journalism. If the media is not being truthful to the best of their ability, then there is no use for it. But if the media is fabricating stories in order to distract the public, then that is not only altering public opinion but altering history."

Its impact on the global economy has been equally catastrophic, as governments have been forced into imposing strict lockdown measures. As economists face a generation-defining challenge on what to do next, all around the world focus is beginning to shift towards finance ministers – like Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the UK – rather than health ministers such as Matt Hancock.

But a warning from Mr Soros – the famed financier and philanthropist who was once credited with ‘breaking the pound’ – appears worryingly relevant today. Speaking to Newsweek in 2012, the billionaire warned of economic collapse and riots on the streets in light of the eurozone crisis of the time. Having bought $2billion (£1.6billion) in European bonds, he said: “The euro must survive because the alternative – a breakup – would cause a meltdown that Europe, the world, can’t afford. “The situation is about as serious and difficult as I’ve experienced in my career. We are facing now a general retrenchment in the developed world.”

His warnings came as US stocks plummeted amid talks intended to resolve Greece's debt crisis faltered. “The worst-case scenario is a collapse of the financial system.” The now 89-year-old also compared the crisis to the fall of the Soviet Union in the early Nineties, claiming a euro collapse could “revive the political conflicts that have torn Europe apart over the centuries”.

His fears appear just as relevant today as they did in 2012, as EU member states have been embroiled in a bitter row over how to split up the financial costs of the pandemic. Italy, for example, has consistently argued for more help from its European partners, as the current crisis was impossible to predict. While Germany and the Netherlands are opposed to the idea as they fear the political implications of having their taxpayers foot the bill for other nations. DON'T MISS

These divisions have opened up old wounds from the 2008 financial crisis. And former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis believes he can explain why – because the wounds never healed in the first place, they were merely hidden from view. In a video posted on his YouTube channel DiEM25 earlier this year, he said: ""Don't let anyone tell you the 2008 crisis ended and that now you have a new one. ""That crisis never ended. It just moved in different forms, travelled from one continent to another. ""But nevertheless it has always been with us. ""The world never went back to some kind of equilibrium after 2008. ""What coronavirus has done, it has deepened and accelerated this never-ending non-stop crisis that began in 2008.""

Mr Varoufakis also shed light on why he thinks the world was presented with the illusion of a recovery after 2011. He added: ""They printed trillions and trillions of notes and threw them at the 0.1 percent at corporations that were already full of money. For example, Apple, Google and so on. ""They boosted inequality massively and stabilised financial markets. But at the same time, they depleted all serious investments in good quality jobs in labour, health, education. ""This is why there has been so much discontent even before COVID-19 arrived on the scene."

Two decades ago DePaulo and her colleagues asked 147 adults to jot down for a week every instance they tried to mislead someone. The researchers found that the subjects lied on average one or two times a day. Most of these untruths were innocuous, intended to hide one’s inadequacies or to protect the feelings of others. Some lies were excuses—one subject blamed the failure to take out the garbage on not knowing where it needed to go. Yet other lies—such as a claim of being a diplomat’s son—were aimed at presenting a false image. While these were minor transgressions, a later study by DePaulo and other colleagues involving a similar sample indicated that most people have, at some point, told one or more “serious lies”—hiding an affair from a spouse, for example, or making false claims on a college application.

The question Ariely finds interesting is not why so many lie, but rather why they don’t lie a lot more. Even when the amount of money offered for correct answers is raised significantly, the volunteers don’t increase their level of cheating. “Here we give people a chance to steal lots of money, and people cheat only a little bit. So something stops us—most of us—from not lying all the way,” Ariely says. The reason, according to him, is that we want to see ourselves as honest, because we have, to some degree, internalized honesty as a value taught to us by society. Which is why, unless one is a sociopath, most of us place limits on how much we are willing to lie. How far most of us are willing to go—Ariely and others have shown—is determined by social norms arrived at through unspoken consensus, like the tacit acceptability of taking a few pencils home from the office supply cabinet."

Customers from the pharmaceutical, chemical and academic fields equip their laboratories with our high-quality, Swiss-made instruments.

Whether our clients work with preparative chromatography, laboratory, industrial and parallel evaporation, spray drying, freeze-drying, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), melting point determination, extraction or Kjeldahl determination, we work to deliver solutions tailored to the customer’s needs.

A concentration step may need to be carried out at several points of the drug discovery workflow. One of the methods for concentration of compounds of interest is rotary evaporation, which is typically used to evaporate organic solvents or improve drug characteristics such as stability.

BUCHI was one of the first companies to commercialise the rotary evaporator and we currently remain one of the leading providers of rotary evaporation solutions worldwide. By offering unmatched time-savings through features such as automatic distillations, foam detection and remote control possibilities, our Rotavapor products are well-suited to a busy pharmaceuticals R&D lab.

We offer customised control of the Rotavapor, vacuum pump and chiller, as well as a wide selection of heating baths, vacuum pumps, condensers and glassware to suit applications.

Some types of chromatography are indispensable on the path to discovering novel therapeutics. Flash and preparative chromatography, however, can be used to isolate molecules before further analysis.

BUCHI’s Pure chromatography system offers maximal space-saving through the combination of both flash and preparative chromatography options in a single instrument. The chromatography unit also has an integrated UV and evaporative light scattering (ELS) detection.

We aim to guarantee high sample safety with the help of features such as leak, pressure and solvent level sensors, as well as radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology on cartridges and racks.

The characterisation of novel therapeutics frequently requires a drying step to remove water or organic solvents from products. Drying through spray drying or lyophilisation enables longer shelf life and improved stability, making product processing, transportation, storage and dissolution more efficient.

Our Mini Spray Dryer has been featured in more than 1,000 publications and over 500 patents, offering a fast-drying process with speeds of up to 1L an hour. The unit also provides high yields of up to 70% from even small amounts of less than 5g of a sample.

Our Lyovapor freeze-drying solutions offer continuous, reproducible lyophilisation of water and organic-based solvents.

The reliability of our products and services are ideal for pharmaceutical applications. Drug discovery and development require safe, efficient and compliant sample processing and analytics. We offer a variety of established solutions for the whole drug production process, creating a seamless workflow with optimal productivity and accuracy."
408,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Saddam Hussein as the dictator and various Arab leaders as actors in the region.,True,The article discusses the actions and concerns of various actors in the Middle East.,True,The article mentions the potential breakup of Iraq and the spread of instability as a threat.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead.,"The noose around the dictator's neck was one of the most striking images ever viewed across the Arab world  an Arab president being held to account. Still, for much of the Arab world, the execution of Saddam Hussein is not being viewed in the light of the vicious crimes he committed against his people and his neighbors. Instead, it is being remembered by the sounds heard on the widely disseminated video of Saddam's final moments  Shi'ite partisans chanting sectarian slogans and praising the radical cleric Moqtada Sadr. Saddam's rule has relatively few defenders in Iraq and beyond, yet the serious flaws in his trial and execution gave many the impression of mob justice rather than the rule of law.

Saddam's downfall has not heralded a new Middle East. The primary concern of Arabs across the region today is the emerging civil war in Iraq and its potential breakup as a state, which threatens to spread a virus of instability across the region. Pro-Western Sunni regimes such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan are increasingly concerned about growing Iranian influence in post-Saddam Iraq, while Turkey is concerned about the creation of a de facto Kurdish mini-state in northern Iraq that may spur greater agitation by Turkey's own Kurdish minority. President Bush's belated acknowledgement that things are bad in Iraq, despite the U.S.'s massive investment of blood and treasure over nearly four years, is hardly comforting to Washington's allies in the region.

As loathed as Saddam's regime may have been among Arabs, many nonetheless viewed him through a nationalist prism. From Morocco to the Gulf, there was widespread admiration for Saddam's willingness to stand against the U.S. and Israel. On the Arab street, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was therefore viewed as an imperialist Western assault on Arabs and Muslims rather than the war of liberation from an odious oppressor, as the Bush Administration had depicted it.

The negative and often conspiratorial view of U.S. goals in Iraq has only been reinforced by Washington's management of post-war Iraq, which has been plunged into the worst turmoil of its history. Instead of frightening other Arab dictators into mending their ways, Saddam's fate will likely encourage them to cling to power at any cost: if you leave office, you run the risk of being executed by your enemies.

The war's architects had hoped that toppling Saddam would set in motion a train of events that would see liberal democracy triumph in the Arab world. Instead, the biggest beneficiary from his demise has been Islamic fundamentalism. Saddam's execution marks the final nail in the coffin of Arab nationalism, a secular ideology of pan-Arab unity and independence. Originating with the Arab Revolt against Ottoman domination of the Middle East nearly a century ago, the ideology took on a militant edge following Arab independence after World War II. Partly as a reaction to Israel's defeat of the Arabs in the 1948 war, Arab nationalism promoted militaristic societies led by warrior leaders who espoused dreams of victory and grandeur. The tragic result has been decades of tyranny, conflict and stagnation for millions of Arabs rather than the blossoming of an Arab renaissance. Egypt's Gamal Abdul Nasser became Arab nationalism's first populist leader with his nationalization of the Suez Canal. But a decade later, he blundered the Arabs into the devastating 1967 war with Israel that spelled the beginning of the end for Arab nationalism.

Saddam fancied himself as the new Nasser when he became Iraq's president in 1979, championing the Palestinian cause and fighting a eight-year war to curb Iran's Islamic Revolution. Many countries  including the U.S.  supported Saddam as a bulwark against Islamic fundamentalism, which they deemed a greater long-term political threat to Western interests than Arab nationalism. But Saddam followed Nasser in blundering his way to defeat, starting with his invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

Saddam's hanging has removed the last Arab strongman willing to fight the fundamentalists in the name of Arab secularism. (The sole remaining candidate is Syrian President Bashar Assad, but his lack of military clout and key alliance with the non-Arab Islamic Republic of Iran undermine his claim to the mantle.) Nor is there much prospect that liberal Arabs will present a new, democratic alternative any time soon. Instead, in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East, the future increasingly belongs to the Islamic fundamentalists. Judging by the escalating conflicts in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories as well in Iraq, that is a future that may be best described as bleak."

Harold Uhlig, an economist at the university and editor of the prestigious Journal of Political Economy, has equated BLM protesters to ""flat earthers"" and said they should have coordinated their protests with police departments, according to the New York Times.

In subsequent tweets, he has walked back some of the comments and on Tuesday said he was ""was trying to make fun of that radical and untenable view of massively cutting funding of police departments. Wrong words, mea culpa. But we all share the same goal."" He also said BLM is ""a movement that is sorely needed now and applauded by so many.""

Earlier, though, he chided the movement:

Yellen has joined a choir of economists who have criticized Uhlig, with some calling for his removal as editor of the journal.

The central bank leader from 2014 to 2018 said in email to the Times that ""the tweets and blog posts by Harald Uhlig are extremely troubling."" She added that ""it would be appropriate for the University of Chicago, which is the publisher of the Journal of Political Economy, to review Uhlig's performance and suitability to continue as editor."".

Yellen declined further comment. Uhlig and the journal did not respond to emails.

As is the case with most Fed officials, she has avoided involving herself in political issues. She led the San Francisco Fed during the financial crisis and helped guide the central bank off away from near zero interest rates and the extensive bond buying programs instituted during and after the Great Recession.

President Donald Trump chose not to reappoint Yellen, who was replaced with Jerome Powell. She is now a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution.

The move to defund the police has come in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police."

The country's health ministry reported 19,951 new cases in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 291,579 confirmed cases.

This new surge tops the previous record set Tuesday. Reported deaths caused by coronavirus also increased by 888 on Wednesday, bringing to the country's total to 18,859 deaths, the ministry said.

Asked about Brazil's skyrocketing numbers on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said that he was mulling a travel ban on Brazil.

""We are considering it,"" Trump said, adding: ""We hope that we're not going to have a problem. The governor of Florida is doing very, very well testing -- in particular Florida, because a big majority come in to Florida. Brazil has gone more or less herd, and they're having problems.

""I worry about everything, I don't want people coming in here and infecting our people,"" Trump said, ""I don't want people over there sick, either.""

Amid the spiraling health crisis, Brazil's lower house of Congress has approved a proposed law that would make use the use of personal protection masks in public spaces mandatory.

The proposed law would require people to wear any form of face covering in areas that are accessible to the public, including parks, sidewalks, public transportation and even private buildings where there is a high level of foot traffic. Individuals not wearing masks would be fined up to $52.

The proposal needs approval by the Senate and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who rarely wears facial coverings. It is unclear when the Senate vote will happen.

Brazil's alarming numbers come days after Sao Paulo's mayor warned that its health system could be overwhelmed very soon if residents don't follow social distancing guidelines. Officials in the major city of 12 million have declared a five-day holiday in a bid to get residents to stay home.

By Monday, Brazil achieved the grim record of having the third-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, behind the United States and Russia.

Yet Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the threat of the virus, saying quarantines and lockdowns could have a worse impact on Brazil's economy.

He has repeatedly dismissed Covid-19 as a ""little flu"" and urged businesses to reopen, even as many governors scramble to implement social isolation measures and slow the spread.

The country lost its second health minister in a month last week. Nelson Teich stepped down after clashing with Bolsonaro over the country's coronavirus strategy. In April, Bolsonaro fired his predecessor, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after a prolonged standoff.

Teich clashed with Bolsonaro over the use of malaria drugs to treat the virus and social isolation measures.

Despite the political crisis, the populist leader continues to tout chloroquine as a potential wonder drug against the new coronavirus -- like his US counterpart Trump -- even though it is an unproven treatment for Covid-19.

""Today we will have a new protocol on chloroquine"" issued by the Ministry of Health, Bolsonaro wrote, calling it ""a hope, according to the many who have used it.""

Brazil's medical authority approved the use of hydroxychloroquine -- which has been described as the less toxic derivative of chloroquine -- in April in serious cases of coronavirus if the doctor and patient agree. Bolsonaro has since pushed for approval to use the drug in less serious cases."

He related the situations in both of those countries with what is currently happening in Syria and seemed to endorse a stronger President Bashar Assad, even while admitting that he is ""probably a bad guy.""

""You can make the case, if you look at Libya, look at what we did there — it's a mess — if you look at Saddam Hussein with Iraq, look what we did there — it's a mess — it's [Syria] going to be same thing,"" the real estate mogul said.

This is a sentiment that Trump took with him on Saturday to a rally in Franklin, Tennessee where he recalled our strategy with arming rebels during the days of Qaddafi’s reign. Trump told about 1,500 in an event hall: “Then the rebels killed our ambassador in the worst way, what happened to him. And three other people, and many other people by the way. Okay? Remember that.”

In regards to Iraq, Trump echoed a familiar line from his campaign: “Don’t forget, ISIS came out of Iraq,” Trump recalled, calling the terror organization “the leftovers that didn’t get taken care of.”

He also told the Franklin audience that during the time of Saddam Hussein’s “vicious” rule in Iraq “there were no terrorists in Iraq.” “You know what he used to do to terrorists?” Trump polled the crowd. “A one day trial and shoot him…and the one day trial usually lasted five minutes, right? There was no terrorism then.”

And in light of recent bombing campaigns by Russian forces in Syria, Trump says that he likes “that Putin is bombin’ the hell out of ISIS” not because he trusts him, but because he realizes that Putin “doesn’t want ISIS coming into Russia.” Trump still predicts that Putin will “get bogged down there” much like many other nations who have interceded in Middle Eastern affairs. “Everybody that’s gone to the Middle East has had nothing but problems.”

But should Trump’s policy positions earn him anything but favorability in the polls, he seemed comfortable telling Chuck Todd that he’d be just as happy back in his business. “I'm not a masochist...If I were doing poorly, if I saw myself going down, if you would stop calling me because you no longer have any interest in Trump because 'he has no chance,' I'd go back to my business."" Trump said that when he looks at the state of the Republican field at large there are some hopefuls who “should not be running any longer” because “they’re not gonna make it.”

“If I felt I was in that position, I’d get out,” he told NBC News. “But in all fairness, I think I’m in the exact opposite position right now.” NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polling has Trump at the top of the latest polls out of Iowa and New Hampshire."

The 36-year-old star took to his Instagram page to share the bizarre conspiracy theory earlier this evening.

The former Blue singer started out by slamming the new 5G mobile networks, which sick YouTube videos accused of causing coronavirus earlier this month.

He then shared an image of a hand being implanted with a microchip, and an x-ray showing the chip within the body - hinting that everybody will be forced to get the implant as a vaccine for the killer disease.

Lee captioned the post: ""This is the mark of the beast - 666 - this will be the next step of governments world wide.

""Sorry to post this s**t but it’s true. I just wanna spread the word so people know the truth of what’s coming....""

The term 666 refers to the devil, with the former EastEnders actor suggesting that this is the next step in the New World Order conspiracy theory.

But followers were confused, with one commenting: ""Are you okay? Have you been hacked?""

Another wrote: ""Has your account been hacked, or have you just lost the plot?""

A third snapped: ""What a load of s***e. Spreading unverified rubbish and conspiracy theories is so dangerous, especially in the current climate.

Lee has always been open about his controversial views, even insisting that he has seen aliens in the past.

He also previously sparked backlash for insensitive comments that were made about 9/11, saying at the time: ""What about whales? They are ignoring animals that are more important.

""Animals need saving and that’s more important. This New York thing is being blown out of proportion.

""Who gives a **** about New York when elephants are being killed?""

He later apologised for the remark after fierce backlash.

MEMPHIS — Forty years of wandering the earth without Elvis hasn't diminished the religious fervor of his faithful fans.

This week, more Elvis fans than ever are expected to make their annual pilgrimage to commiserate and commemorate his Aug. 16, 1977, death.

They will go to Memphis and walk tenderly and mournfully with lit candles through Graceland's Meditation Garden where he was laid to rest.

They will go to Mississippi and sit and stand prayerfully inside the East Tupelo First Assembly of God where he first learned to love the Lord and play the guitar.

""All I want is to know the truth, to know and experience God. I’m a searcher, that’s what I’m all about,"" Elvis told a friend late in life, according to Gary Tillery's The Seeker King.

Elvis was baptized, undoubtedly, as a child by a Trinitarian Pentecostal preacher in Tupelo, Miss.

He was re-baptized, reportedly, as a young teenager by a Oneness Pentecostal preacher in Memphis.

He also was baptized, posthumously, by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Multiple baptisms aren't uncommon here in the land of religious liberty, where beliefs and practices vary widely, even within various Christian denominations.

Elvis grew up in the heart of the Pentecostal South at East Tupelo First Assembly of God, where his parents met and his great-uncles were co-pastors.

The Assemblies of God, the world's largest Pentecostal body, follow the traditional triune formula found in Matthew 28:19: ""Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.""

As a child, Elvis was water baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, according to biographers.

When Elvis was 13, the Presleys moved to Memphis. They lived near the Church of Jesus Christ, led by Rex Dyson, a Oneness Pentecostal preacher.

Oneness Pentecostals reject the triune formula for baptism. Instead, they use Peter's instructions in Acts 2:38: ""Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.""

They baptize believers in the name of Jesus only.

""Vernon and Gladys heard me preach about baptism a few times, then they came to me and said they wanted to be baptized in the name of Jesus,"" Dyson told me in 2000, two years before he died. ""I baptized Elvis in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.""

There is no record of either baptism, but that isn't unusual, said Dr. James R. Goff of Appalachian State University. He has researched and written about Elvis' Pentecostal roots.

""For most Pentecostals, baptism came after revivals and were not considered synonymous with the process of joining the church,"" said Goff.

For some, baptism also comes after death.

Latter-day Saints believe baptism is essential for eternal salvation. They believe everyone should get that chance, even those who were never baptized or were baptized without proper authority.

So they perform proxy baptisms on behalf of the dead. That includes Elvis, who reportedly was thinking of converting to Mormonism.

According to a 2006 documentary, Tears of a King, Elvis had been reading and making notes in the Book of Mormon, and talking to missionaries about converting a few months before his untimely death.

Apocryphal or not, the stories of Elvis' three baptisms only serve to enhance his immortality.

""With Elvis, there's a sense of promises unfulfilled,"" Goff said, ""given the degree to which he seemed to never quite find the happiness he sought.""

Not in this life, anyway.

The list got longer to 113 within two days, with 13 more countries added by 11 March.

Nearly 35% of the confirmed global Covid-19 cases are currently outside China (full details here). Five new countries including Turkey, Jamaica, Honduras, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia announced the first confirmed cases on 10 March. Cuba, Ivory Coast and Guyana joined the countries with coronavirus on 11 March.

Furthermore, the daily number of cases reported outside China is currently much higher than those reported in China signifying the global spread and possible worsening of the epidemic in the days to come.

Novel coronavirus now a pandemic: WHO

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19) as a pandemic on 11 March. The WHO commented that inaction by countries is as worrying as the coronavirus itself.

What is a pandemic and why WHO termed Covid-19 as a pandemic

A disease outbreak is termed as a pandemic when it goes uncontained spreading across the world.



The 2019 coronavirus outbreak was not termed pandemic earlier because of its presence in limited countries and perceived slower transmission.

The WHO had expected that the Covid-19 had pandemic potential but didn’t term it so since it believed effective containment measures through early and rapid response would control its spread.

Spread to 58% of the countries in the world and delayed/insufficient measures resulting in containing further spread have led to the WHO treating the disease as a pandemic meaning that governments will have to take more stringent steps to contain the disease.

The world has not witnessed a pandemic since the 2009 H1N1 influenza (swine flu) outbreak.

Coronavirus cases outside China are currently the highest in Italy, followed by Iran, South Korea, France and Spain.

Italy and Iran are currently witnessing a big surge in coronavirus cases and have overtaken South Korea, while Spanish coronavirus cases have crossed Germany’s.

Italy currently has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the European Union (EU). Lockdowns and travel restrictions, which were limited to China at the beginning of 2020, have become a common thing in other coronavirus-affected countries such as Italy.

Covid-19 cases in France, Spain and Germany in the EU surged past 1,000 over the weekend recording the second, third and fourth highest number of cases in Europe.

Among the Middle East countries, Iran has the highest coronavirus cases. A significant number of countries trace their first coronavirus cases to Iran.

Coronavirus is yet to reach Syria and Yemen in the Middle East, but it may just be a matter of time.

The UK and the US, which joined the coronavirus countries list late and had cases in double-digit for most of February now have 459 and 1,312 cases, respectively. US Covid-19 reported cases are expected to increase further over this week as more test kits become available across states.

Coronavirus death toll: which countries have the highest deaths?

Deaths caused by coronavirus outside China are currently the highest in Italy (827), Iran (354) and South Korea (60) followed by Spain and France. The US is among the top ten outside China, having recorded more than 30 deaths.

Coronavirus-related deaths in China crossed 3,000 in the first week of March and currently stand at 3,158."

But she is perhaps best known for claiming that she was abducted by space aliens as a child.

Rodriguez Aguilera is a longshot in the race for the Miami-area seat being vacated by retiring Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Yet last weekend, the Miami Herald endorsed her for the GOP nomination in the Tuesday primary out of a field of nine candidates.

In an interview, Rodriguez Aguilera said she is grateful for the endorsement and that her tale of kidnapping by aliens does not define her.

""It has nothing to do with what I have done. It happened when I was 7 years old,"" she said. ""I am so proud of the Herald and what they did.""

Rodriguez Aguilera says she was taken aboard a spaceship as a young girl by blond extraterrestrials who resembled the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. She says they told her that the ""center of the world's energy is Africa"" and that thousands of non-human skulls were once discovered in a cave on the Mediterranean island of Malta.

She has said she witnessed paranormal activity since then and saw a UFO at age 17. She also said she has been in touch with the aliens telepathically long after the abduction.

Even if it's hard to believe there's a starman waiting in the sky, Rodriguez Aguilera won't back down.

""I stick to my guns when I believe in something,"" she said.

In its Sunday editorial , the Herald reported that two of the leading Republican candidates — former Miami-Dade commissioner Bruno Barreiro and Spanish-language television journalist Maria Elvira Salazar — did not take part in the paper's endorsement process. And beyond Rodriguez Aguilera, the editorial found the remaining candidates unprepared or unqualified.

""We realize that Rodriguez Aguilera is an unusual candidate,"" the editorial noted, adding that the paper was impressed with her ""boots-on-the-ground ideas and experience.""

Rodriguez Aguilera is a former City Council member in the suburb of Doral who is the daughter of a Cuban political prisoner. She previously was a social worker, ombudsman at the Miami-Dade county manager's office and now runs a business training women in other countries how to run for political office.

""The theme of my campaign is people above politics. I train people around the world about democracy,"" she said. ""I have the most experience. I can go in there and start working just as I have all my life.""

Whoever emerges from the GOP field Tuesday will face one of five Democratic candidates and the seat is considered one of the party's best chances for a switch from the GOP.

Polls show the leader on the Democratic side is former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who was also president of the University of Miami and University of Wisconsin. The Herald, however, endorsed state Rep. David Richardson over Shalala."

The financial industry grew to a point there it represented 25 percent of the stock market capitalization of the United States.

Shortly before the subprime crisis, US treasury secretary Hank Paulson insisted that it is best to leave the financial sector alone to do its work. This is not a surprising statement for a former CEO of investment bank Goldman Sachs, whom we would expect to have the interests of the financial industry close to his heart. However, the statement also embodies the prevailing view espoused by textbook economics and economists giving policy advice. According to this view, competition among financial service providers, issuers of securities and investors will ensure that prices of financial instruments reflect their value at all times and that scarce financial resources are allocated to their best uses. It also holds that financial markets tend toward equilibrium and accurately reflect all available information about the future.

The laissez-faire attitude of mainstream economics stands in contrast to popular wisdom. “Money is Power” goes the saying. Those who have a lot of money tend to have commensurate power."

Richard Clarke, a former national security adviser to three presidents, described in his 2004 book ""Against All Enemies"" the scene in the White House in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks against the United States, with President Bush and other senior officials trying to link Hussein directly to Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's organization. No such link was ever established.

Just before the invasion, Hussein, cigar in hand, appeared on television almost nightly, belittling American forces to small groups of Republican Guard commanders. He also admonished that the battlefields should be throughout Iraq, wherever there were people, even while secretly planning to protect only Baghdad.

His main concern was preserving his government, which the United States military discovered in interviews with his top aides after they were captured. Some of the unclassified results were published in a 2006 article in Foreign Affairs titled ""Saddam's Delusions: The View From the Inside.""

By 2003, Iraq's military was anemic, weakened by sanctions and constant changes in command, not to mention the fact that Hussein, suspicious of coup attempts, barred any rigorous maneuvers and repeatedly created new popular militias. Commanders also constantly lied to him about their state of preparedness. The United States report quoted Hussein's personal interpreter as saying that the president thought that his ""superior"" forces would put up a ""heroic resistance and inflict such enormous losses on the Americans that they would stop their advance.""

Hussein cited both Vietnam and the hasty American withdrawal from Somalia in 1994 as evidence that Americans could not stomach casualties, and he did not take the threat of regime change seriously. He so believed his own publicity about his success in fighting the first gulf war that he used it as a blueprint for the second. Hence, his main worry during the invasion was to avoid repeating the Shiite and Kurdish internal rebellion of 1991. He did not blow up the bridges over the Tigris and Euphrates to slow the American advance, for example, out of concern that he would need to rush troops south to quell any uprising. Nor did he order the oilfields ignited, as he had in Kuwait, thinking he would need the revenue in the postwar period.

""Even with U.S. tanks crossing the Iraqi border, an internal revolt remained Saddam's biggest fear,"" Tariq Aziz, the former deputy prime minister, told the American investigators.

The war plan as described in the 2006 book ""Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq"" states that while Republican Guard troops were supposed to seal off the approaches to Baghdad, only the Special Republican Guard was permitted inside the capital, again as insurance against a coup. Military commanders needed permission for any large troop movements, and the collapse came so quickly that Hussein was still issuing orders to units that had ceased to exist."

In its 2004 report on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the commission warned that the Transportation Security Administration and Congress ""must give priority attention to improving the ability of screening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers.""

But at most airports, travelers simply pass through magnetometers, which are unlikely to detect bomb materials on their body.

Nigerian suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, is accused of trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane going from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, with explosives concealed in his underwear. The explosives failed to detonate properly.

A Government Accounting Office report from October found that TSA has an array of ""10 passenger-screening technologies."" But the TSA, the report indicates, ""has not deployed any of these technologies to airports nationwide.""

One solution aviation experts point to is sophisticated screening technology such as full-body scans, which are more likely to detect explosives. But those devices are years away for most U.S. airports -- though several are in operation at major airports across the country.

Larry Johnson, a former counterterrorism official in the State Department, said action taken on the commission's technology recommendations is lackluster.

Johnson said devices to trace both bulk and trace amounts of explosives, as recommended by the commission, should be operational at U.S. checkpoints.

""It wasn't done after 9/11,"" Johnson said. ""And there's no excuse for not doing it now.""

Schneier: Is aviation security mostly for show?

Johnson said that if airports have the ""right security"" procedures in place, ""it doesn't matter whether you have an intelligence failure, that those systems will prevent the threat.""

The 9/11 report states that constraining terrorist travel ""should become a vital part of counterterrorism strategy. Better technology and training to detect terrorist travel documents are the most important immediate steps to reduce American's vulnerability to clandestine entry.""

Clark Kent Ervin, a former inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security, said that had more sophisticated technology been in place, it ""would have noticed something anomalous.""

""I think the flying public has reason for concern,"" he said.

Another commission recommendation under the microscope: The ability to improve communications between the various intelligence agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local police.

There must be an improved use of ""no-fly"" and ""automatic selectee"" lists that ""should not be delayed,"" the report stated.

Fran Townsend, a former Homeland Security adviser in the Bush administration and current CNN contributor, argued there has been ""tremendous progress"" toward achieving that goal with the creation of the National Counterterrorism Center.

""At the National Counterterrorism Center, you have got people from every one of these agencies sitting there together actually sharing the information,"" she said, adding that there are still information gaps that need to be filled.

The NCTC is under the control of Dennis Blair, director of national intelligence (DNI), a position created post-9/11.

Since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, intelligence agencies are ""still not talking,"" according to Jack Rice, a former CIA officer.

A senior administration official said in a briefing Tuesday that there have been ""tremendous advances"" as a result of the DNI.

""And the DNI plays a fundamental role,"" the senior administration official said. ""That was a key reform out of the 9/11 Commission.""

But Rice said that instead of saying ""we need to spread this [information] out and figure out what it is that we do know amongst all of these organizations, they have decided to hold on to it again. This is astounding.""

President Obama, responding to the failed terrorist attack, seemingly agreed on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters during his vacation in Hawaii, Obama said that the airport security system created after the 9/11 terrorist attacks was ""not sufficiently up to date to take full advantage of the information we collect and knowledge we have.""

""Had this critical information been shared, it could have been compiled with other intelligence, and a fuller, clearer picture of the suspect would have emerged,"" Obama said. ""The warning signs would have triggered red flags, and the suspect would have never been allowed to board that plane for America.""

And those warning signs were reportedly found in the latest incident in Detroit.

U.S. intelligence officials had received information signaling AbdulMutallab might be a terrorism threat but failed to take steps to prevent the man from boarding the flight.

""What already is apparent is that there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security,"" Obama said. ""We need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake.""

Obama has ordered preliminary results of an investigation into what went wrong by Thursday."

A brief outage for Microsoft's online video game network on Wednesday was enough to send rapper Snoop Dogg over the edge, launching an angry expletive-laden tirade against the technology company — and its founder Bill Gates.

Posting on his personal Instagram account, the legendary artist — responsible for songs such as ""Gin and Juice"" — threatened to switch to rival Sony PlayStation if the servers were not fixed.

""What the f*** are you doing Bill Gates, fix your s*** man,"" he said. ""It's that difficult to play somebody online.""

While Bill Gates is founder, advisor and a board member at Microsoft, he transitioned out of a day-to-day role in the company in 2008. He served as chairman of the board until February, 2014.

While not on the same scale as Gates, Snoop Dogg has also branched out into the online world, founding a cannabis lifestyle website MerryJane.com.

Microsoft's Xbox One console has online capabilities called Xbox Live that allow millions of gamers around the world to compete from the comfort of their own homes. However, from time to time, technical issues haunt both Microsoft and rival Sony and brief server outages occur.

The tech giant's support team tweeted that it was aware of the outage on Wednesday afternoon and seven hours later it announced that the problems had been resolved. It also reported a brief outage on January 6 and Sony had to deal with its own issues on November 27 when users had difficulty launching online features of games and applications."

I have lost complete respect for their sanity. I say this as a 61-year-old female nana of four from Canada.

The US is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in Somalia, or any other country for that matter, that is harboring terrorists. These people are responsible for killing American citizens, as well as many other people from all over the world. We cannot let these people get away with these crimes. The entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists, Europe included. If the world does not stand up now, we will have a much, much bigger problem in the years to come. No one stood up to Hitler until it was too late, we can't afford to do the same thing again. - Richard Mattis

While I am not confident of the overall wisdom of launching these attacks, I've no doubt that those on the receiving end of the attacks richly deserve them. - Tom

The US gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism. Terrorists are killing defenseless men, women, children and our freedom. How do you bring terrorists in for peace talks? Let history speak for itself. Europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns, killing civilians indiscriminately. We do not want to see history repeat itself, therefore we will stop them when and where ever we find them. In doing so, we may succeed in saving lives here and abroad. - Frank Penna

My friends in Germany, wake up and smell the jihad. Just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country, reeling from a century of warfare, and understandably wishing for peace in this world, being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat. These are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the Middle East, Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, England, Spain, Thailand, and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet. Eradicating these people, especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders, as was done in Somalia just now, is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace. Somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical Islamic threat. Only a fool loves war, but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him. Godspeed to the Ethiopian army. More civilized nations, especially the ""blind mice"" of Europe, had better come on board before it's too late. Germany: you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason. - Ron Jendry

I believe it was the Islamist and warlords that destabilized Somalia, not the USA, which killed a known terrorist, one that could have easily struck any of the EU embassies or nations. I believe that the EU has lost perspective here and that it is easier for the EU to criticize than it is to take action or stand by a known ally. - J. Becher"

In one of the longest, most passionate and sweeping speeches of his pontificate, the Argentine-born pope also asked forgiveness for the sins committed by the Roman Catholic Church in its treatment of native Americans during what he called the “so-called conquest of America.”

Quoting a fourth century bishop, he called the unfettered pursuit of money “the dung of the devil,” and said poor countries should not be reduced to being providers of raw material and cheap labor for developed countries.

Repeating some of the themes of his landmark encyclical “Laudato Si” on the environment last month, Francis said time was running out to save the planet from perhaps irreversible harm to the ecosystem.

Francis made the address to participants of the second world meeting of popular movements, an international body that brings together organizations of people on the margins of society, including the poor, the unemployed and peasants who have lost their land. The Vatican hosted the first meeting last year.

He said he supported their efforts to obtain “so elementary and undeniably necessary a right as that of the three “L’s”: land, lodging and labor.”

His speech was preceded by lengthy remarks from leftist Bolivian President Evo Morales, who wore a jacket adorned with the face of Argentine revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara. He was executed in Bolivia in 1967 by CIA-backed Bolivian troops.

“Let us not be afraid to say it: we want change, real change, structural change,” the pope said, decrying a system that “has imposed the mentality of profit at any price, with no concern for social exclusion or the destruction of nature.”

“This system is by now intolerable: farm workers find it intolerable, laborers find it intolerable, communities find it intolerable, peoples find it intolerable … The earth itself – our sister, Mother Earth, as Saint Francis would say – also finds it intolerable,” he said in an hour-long speech that was interrupted by applause and cheering dozens of times.

Since his election in 2013, the first pope from Latin America has often spoken out in defense of the poor and against unbridled capitalism but the speech in this Bolivian city was the most comprehensive to date on the issues he has championed.

Francis’ previous attacks on capitalism have prompted stiff criticism from politicians and commentators in the United States, where he is due to visit in September.

The pontiff appeared to take a swipe at international monetary organizations such as the IMF and the development aid policies by some developed countries.

“No actual or established power has the right to deprive peoples of the full exercise of their sovereignty. Whenever they do so, we see the rise of new forms of colonialism which seriously prejudice the possibility of peace and justice,” he said.

“The new colonialism takes on different faces. At times it appears as the anonymous influence of mammon: corporations, loan agencies, certain ‘free trade’ treaties, and the imposition of measures of ‘austerity’ which always tighten the belt of workers

and the poor,” he said.

Last week, Francis called on European authorities to keep human dignity at the center of debate for a solution to the economic crisis in Greece..

He defended labor unions and praised poor people who had formed cooperatives to create jobs where previously “there were only crumbs of an idolatrous economy”.

In one of the sections on colonialism, he said: “I say this to you with regret: many grave sins were committed against the native peoples of America in the name of God.”

He added: “I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offences of the Church herself, but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America.

“There was sin and an abundant amount of it.”

The audience gave Francis a standing ovation when he put on a yellow miner’s hat that was given to him at the end of his speech.

The pope made his speech at the end of his first full day in Bolivia, where he arrived on Wednesday. On Thursday morning he said a Mass for hundreds of thousands of people and said that everyone had a moral duty to help the poor, and that those with means could not wish they would just “go away.”

Francis praised Bolivia’s social reforms to spread wealth under Morales. On Friday, he will walk into Bolivia’s notoriously violent Palmasola prison.

The pope looked bemused on Wednesday night when Morales handed him one of the more unusual gifts he has received: a sculpted wooden hammer and sickle - the symbol of communism - with a figure of a crucified Christ resting on the hammer.

Francis leaves on Friday for Paraguay, the last stop on his “homecoming” trip."

Facebook has come under fire all year from tech pundits, politicians and concerned citizens over multiple data breaches, collecting personal information that can be in turn marketed to advertisers and how easy it's been for outside forces like Russia and other countries to manipulate media for political gain.

""I am hardly the first person to quit Facebook and I am not urging anyone else to do so, or trying to spark some dump-Facebook movement,"" wrote Mossberg, who retired in 2016 after cover tech for years for the Wall Street Journal, ReCode and the Verge. He is currently writing a book about his years in tech.

""This is a decision I am making just for myself. If the company or the service change significantly for the better, in my view, or become effectively regulated, I may resume regular use.""

Mossberg declined further comment, saying he preferred to have his posts on Facebook and Twitter speak for themselves. Facebook also declined to comment.

On Twitter, many congratulated Mossberg for taking the stand, while others criticized him for sticking with Twitter, or the Internet, for that matter.

""If that's your standard, you might as well quit using the Internet entirely,"" wrote Douglas Chia on Twitter.

The latest Facebook controversy erupted in November, when the New York Times revealed that Facebook had hired a political consulting firm to dig up dirt on George Soros, the billionaire financier who had criticized Facebook policies.

Initially, Facebook execs said they were unaware that the firm, Definers, a Republican linked lobbying firm, had worked for the social network, but then admitted to the hiring, saying that chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg was aware of the hire.

Just last week Facebook apologized for its latest security breach, a bug that affected up to 6.8 million people who used a Facebook login and gave permission to third-party apps to access their photos.

Facebook says the bug has been fixed but indicated some third-party apps “may have had access to a broader set of photos than usual” spanning the 12-day period between Sept. 13 and Sept. 25.

At its most bizarre extreme, conspiracy theorists believe that the contrails which form behind jet aircrafts are actually streams of toxic “mind-control” chemicals. They say these toxins dilute before they reach the ground, leaving a gas we breathe in that keeps the general population in check.

Others suggest we are being secretly vaccinated against diseases from above. But there are a growing number of chemtrail believers, who claim the conspiracy is actually a secret global plot to change Earth’s climate in the hope it will reverse the effects of global warming. Dane Wigington, a solar energy expert and former employee of Bechtel Power Corp, now runs Geoengineeringwatch.org, a website set up to expose the “harmful” conspiracy which has millions of visitors.

According to Mr Wigington, the contrails, or chemtrails, we see forming behind an aircraft most days are carrying out geoengineering - a genuine scientific term for manipulating Earth's climate. An introduction to the subject on his website states: “It sounds like science fiction, but it’s not. It’s happening right above you."" He said a system called Solar Radiation Management (SRM) was being used whereby scientists tried to mimic the effects of a major volcanic eruption on temperature, by releasing the same chemicals into the atmosphere which are known to block sunlight. Some people believe it has already been taking place for a number of years, and say the aircraft leave chemtrails -long-lasting trails in the sky.

Also, now the Hubble space telescope has shown us that this sun is only one of billions of suns in the known universe, meaning that Earth can’t possibly be the only planet in the universe harboring life? — W., Guilford, Conn., via godsquadquestion@aol.com

Answer: Every religious person must at some point resolve the problem of the relationship between religion and science. When the Bible was written, there was no difference between works of science and works of faith.

The Bible is a work of all the wisdom people had almost 4,000 years ago. At that time, the biblical view of the structure of the world imagined a flat earth supported by pillars that extend through water to a firm foundation. Over the earth was a clear dome with gates in it that separated the waters that were over the earth from the waters that were under the Earth. This is not true.

So what are we religious people to do about that?

One answer is to throw out everything the Bible has to say about everything. For me, this is ridiculous. The moral teachings of the Bible about the sanctity of life and about not murdering or stealing and about giving to the poor and about forgiveness are as valid today as they were four millennia ago.

They are answers to the question of how we ought to live in the world. Questions about what is in the world or how the world is constructed are another matter entirely and do not in any way alter my belief that the Bible is the word of God.

I don’t feel compelled to endorse biblical science in order to love biblical morality. In fact, I believe God wanted us to learn more and more over time about how the world works.

The late paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen J. Gould called science and religion, “Non-overlapping magesteria.”

He said, “Science tells us how the heavens look and religion tells us how to get to heaven.”

These are two separate and non-overlapping domains of human thought and they ought not be in conflict.

Sometimes, people of faith who claim that religious people must believe that biblical science is true breach the boundary. In my view, they make religion impossible for thinking people to endorse.

On the other hand, there are scientists who breach the boundary by claiming that our morality is just the result of genetic evolution. They make our sanctity and human uniqueness evaporate in a purely materialistic world.

The right path is to be open to science and to be vigilant about the boundary line between science and our life of virtue and faith. If God did not want this, God would not have given us brains. Somewhere between scientific curiosity and spiritual kindness there is a life to live and a world to both admire and heal.

My favorite biblical passage referring to the pillars of the earth is from I Samuel 2:8: “He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and he hath set the world upon them.”

For those, like me who believe that in deep and mysterious ways, the Bible is indeed the word of God, this passage is perfect.

The pillars of the earth are not physical pillars, they are moral pillars and our treatment of the poor and beggar will actually determine if the earth is sustained or collapses under the weight of greed and indifference.

Q: I study world religion and theology. I know burnt sacrifices were a big part of the Hebrew religious tradition and I know why we Christians no longer make them (because we believe Jesus was the last and only necessary sacrifice), but do Jews still practice burnt sacrifices? And if not, why not? — A., Buffalo, NY, via godsquadquestion@aol.com

A: Most of the biblical sacrifices were not of animals but small barley cakes mixed with oil and incense that were burned up in large fire pans. The animal sacrifices also provided sustenance for the priests and their families.

When the Temple was destroyed in the year 70 by the Romans, the rabbis who took over Judaism (and early Christianity) after the priests, transformed each sacrifice into a prayer in the prayer book. If the Temple is ever rebuilt, the sacrificial offerings will have to be brought again, but don’t hold your breath and don’t go collect your cows!"

It also mentions the Fellowship's previous relationships with dictators.,True,The article connects events and observations to an integrated whole by discussing the history and actions of the Fellowship.,True,"The article mentions secretive actions, such as building relationships with people in power and making overtures to world leaders.","Ivanwald, Sharlet found out, was an enclave where young Christian men could eat meat, study the Gospels, play basketball, and be indoctrinated into a group that promised them exceptionalism. Coe, the purported leader of the Fellowship, had long expressed admiration for the ways in which leaders engendered loyalty through brotherhood, citing Hitler, Mao, and the Mafia as inspiration. The residents of Ivanwald learned to be humble by submitting to God and doing menial work. The Fellowship, in the meantime, was building relationships with people in power, establishing an 8,000-square-foot townhouse in D.C. where Fellowship-affiliated congressmen could live, hosting the National Prayer Breakfast once a year, and making overtures to world leaders with the capacity to advance a Christian agenda.

The first episode largely re-creates Sharlet’s account of his exposure to Ivanwald, in scenes that (despite casting James Cromwell as Coe) aren’t nearly as compelling as the talking-head analysis of what’s actually going on. The second breaks down the two scandals that threatened to derail the C Street house: Ensign’s very public affair, and South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford’s admission in 2009 that he’d also been unfaithful, in a speech that outed the Fellowship as a “Christian bible study” group that Sanford had been leaning on for support. (In doing so, Sharlet explains, Sanford violated the first rule of C Street, which is never to talk about C Street.) The revelation that not one but two Republican members of a shadowy faith group had fallen from grace led to feverish speculation about the Fellowship, including a lengthy 2010 New Yorker feature that likened the group to “a kind of theocratic Blackwater.”

Moss delves into the Fellowship’s history, and along the way provides a fascinating portrait of an organization that seems uniquely motivated by power. The Ivanwald approach to Christianity, Sharlet reveals, is a limited one—the organization has only minimal interest in the Bible and leans on an unorthodox interpretation of Jesus as a brawny avatar of alpha masculinity, a kind of spiritual Navy SEAL or post-career Peyton Manning. Jesus, in the Fellowship’s eyes, isn’t the Lamb of God so much as a license to expand and project patriarchal power. The young men of Ivanwald are told repeatedly that they’ve been chosen by God to be future leaders, significant cogs in a worldwide spiritual offensive. Coe, meanwhile, uses the truism that Jesus sat down with sinners to justify building dubious relationships with genocidal tyrants such as Omar al-Bashir, General Suharto, and Siad Barre. “Most of my friends are bad people,” Coe once said. In the period after the Soviet Union was dismantled, he visited 16 bloc countries in 16 days.

In its third episode, The Family explores the recent ties between the Christian right and Vladimir Putin’s Russia. (Doug Burleigh, one of the Fellowship’s current leaders, was interviewed by the FBI about his dealings with the convicted Russian agent Maria Butina.) The fourth details the Fellowship’s previous relationships with dictators, and its ongoing attempts to enforce “Christian” and anti-LGBTQ policies in countries such as Romania, with gay marriage in the United States seeming at this point like a lost battle. Along the way, Fellowship-affiliated congressmen seem depressingly eager to embrace strongmen under the pretense of Jesus’s name. Senator James Inhofe tells the Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha that he “loves him.” Representative Mark Siljander travels to Libya, where he asks Qaddafi for forgiveness for the U.S. bombing that killed his daughter. (Siljander was later sentenced to a year in prison for accepting stolen funds from a charity with ties to terrorism.)"

On Wednesday, Francis refused to approve the ordination of married men to address the Catholic Church's priest shortage in the world's largest rainforest, but instead, he wrote a document called ""Beloved Amazon"" calling on the world to end the ""injustice and crime"" of global warming committed against the Amazonian people and its environment after record fires devasted the region last year.

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) ferrets over at the National Security Archive (NSA) petitioned for, and got, the CIA’s equivalent of the dog-ate-my-homework. (Technically, the NSA obtained this document under a mandatory-declassification-review request it made in 2006, which can be faster [It still took six years!] than an FOIA request if the requester has sufficient details on a specific document.)

Bottom line, from the CIA’s point of view: Saddam used to lie about possessing WMD, so we believed he still was.

Unfortunately, the U.S. went to war based largely on that false intelligence. And 4,486 U.S. troops, 318 allies and untold thousands of Iraqis died in the ensuing conflict.

While much of the CIA explanation has been redacted, these surviving passages stand out:

— When the [U.N. and International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections proved more intrusive than expected, the Iraqi leadership appears to have panicked and made a fateful decision to secretly destroy much of the remaining nondeclared items and eliminate the evidence. — Clumsy but genuine Iraqi moves toward transparency — significant alterations in their “cheat and retreat” pattern — not only went undetected but instead seemed to confirm that Iraq could and would conceal evidence of proscribed programs. — We now judge that the Iraqis feared that [Saddam’s son-in-law and Iraqi weapons expert Hussein Kamel Hassan al-Majid] — a critical figure in Iraq’s WMD and [denial and deception] activities — would reveal additional undisclosed information. Iraq decided that further widespread deception and attempts to hold onto extensive WMD programs while under U.N. sanctions was untenable and changed strategic direction by adopting a policy of disclosure and improved cooperation. — Iraq’s firmly established “cheat and retreat” pattern made it difficult for U.N. inspectors and Western analysts to accept new Iraqi assertions at face value. — A liability of intelligence analysis is that once a party has been proven to be an effective deceiver, that knowledge becomes a heavy factor in the calculation of the analytical observer.

But last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation notified police agencies across the country to remain on high alert through the Games and for two weeks after they end.

Although security has always been a priority at the modern Olympics, the Utah Games were widely expected to be the most secure, even before Sept. 11. Mistakes at the Atlanta Games, in which federal, state and local agencies lacked a coordinated response to the bomb, ensured an expanded federal presence.

''All our security efforts here are based on lessons learned in Atlanta,'' said Cynthia D. Gillespie, chief federal lobbyist for the Salt Lake City Games who had the same job in Atlanta. ''After Sept. 11, they were ratcheted up. Not by much, but in those areas where we felt more needed to be done.''

After the Atlanta Games, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order that created a unified task force to deal with large high-profile domestic events, including the Olympics. The order gave the Secret Service responsibility for drawing up the overall plan, and it assigned the Army the task of coordinating the military role. The F.B.I. was instructed to devise a plan to respond to crises, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in charge of dealing with the consequences of incidents.

It is the first time that the protocol has been put in place. In addition to the air surveillance, these are the other steps to be taken:

*Secret Service agents will be used to secure all areas used for Olympic events. In the past, their role was confined to protecting the president and other dignitaries. The expanded presence represents the federal government's largest security investment, $27.2 million, according to the government report.

*For the first time in an Olympics in the United States -- this is the eighth since 1904 -- all law agencies, as well as military commanders, will operate as part of a unified Utah Olympic Public Safety Command.

*Airspace over northern Utah will be heavily guarded, with Awacs surveillance planes on routine missions, F-16's from nearby Hill Air Force Base on alert and added radar operating at Salt Lake City International Airport, where plans call for commercial traffic to be stopped at various times, including the opening and closing ceremonies."

Speaking ahead of next week's IMF and World Bank Springs Meeting, Ms Georgieva claimed the world faced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the Thirties and forecast that 2021 would only see a partial recovery. The IMF's managing director said: ""Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020.

""Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year. ""In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression."" Meanwhile, the US reported that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits had surged for the third week by 6.6 million, bringing the total over that period to more than 16 million Americans. Separately, UK-based charity organisation Oxfam has warned that the economic fallout from the spread of COVID-19 could force more than half a billion more people into poverty. As the crisis deepens, unearthed reports reveal how a new Bretton Woods could be key to restoring life after COVID-19. Towards the end of World War 2, the Allies came together in 1944 to plan a new economic order for the post-war world.

At the conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, 44 Allied countries met under the intellectual leadership of senior US Treasury official Harry Dexter White and British economist John Maynard Keynes. The conference envisaged new rules to prevent countries following the ""beggar-thy-neighbour"" policies that had led to the Great Depression. It established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank as the key institutions to manage this new world order. This new structure was initially successful in allowing the world to recover after the war. The IMF put in place fixed exchange rates based around the dollar, and provided finance to allow countries to make necessary adjustments to their balance of payments provided that they followed sound domestic economic policies. The World Bank provided long-term loans to allow post-war reconstruction, including in support of the Marshall Plan. However, many are now arguing that over the subsequent 50 years the structure of the global economy has changed and that coronavirus has exposed the need for a new Bretton Woods.

""The first stress test, coronavirus, has proved it is completely ineffective."" Ms Stuart echoed Mr Rinaldi's comments and added: ""A new Bretton Woods is similar to what Gordon Brown is proposing, and he is right. ""What this crisis has shown us is that those post World War 2 institutions do not work. ""The US took very much a lead in reaching out to Europe, to get it back on its feet after the war.

Jane Solomon, a linguist-in-residence at Dictionary, said in a recent interview that her site's choice of ""mis"" over ""dis"" was deliberate, intended to serve as a ""call to action"" to be vigilant in the battle against fake news, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers, among other conduits.

It's the idea of intent, whether to inadvertently mislead or to do it on purpose, that the Oakland, California-based company wanted to highlight. The company decided it would go high when others have spent much of 2018 going low.

""The rampant spread of misinformation is really providing new challenges for navigating life in 2018,"" Solomon told The Associated Press ahead of the word of the year announcement. ""Misinformation has been around for a long time, but over the last decade or so the rise of social media has really, really changed how information is shared. We believe that understanding the concept of misinformation is vital to identifying misinformation as we encounter it in the wild, and that could ultimately help curb its impact.""

In studying lookups on the site that trended this year, Dictionary noticed ""our relationship with truth is something that came up again and again,"" she said.

For example, the word ""mainstream"" popped up a lot, spiking in January as the term ""mainstream media,"" or MSM, grew to gargantuan proportions, wielded as an insult by some on the political right. Other words swirling around the same problem included a lookup surge in February for ""white lie"" after Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, admitted to telling a few for President Donald Trump.

The word ""Orwellian"" surfaced in heavy lookups in May, after a statement attributed to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused the Chinese government of ""Orwellian nonsense"" in trying to impose its views on American citizens and private companies when it declared that United Airlines, American Airlines and other foreign carriers should refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China in public-facing materials, such as their websites.

Misinformation, Solomon said, ""frames what we've all been through in the last 12 months."" In that vein, the site with 90 million monthly users has busied itself adding new word entries for ""filter bubble,"" ''fake news,"" ''post-fact,"" ''post-truth"" and ""homophily,"" among others. Other word entries on the site have been freshened to reflect timely new meanings, including ""echo chamber.""

The company's runners-up for the top honor include ""representation,"" driven by the popularity of the movies ""Black Panther"" and ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" along with wins during the U.S. midterm elections for Muslim women, Native Americans and LGBTQ candidates.

But the rise of misinformation, Solomon said, stretches well beyond U.S. borders and Facebook's role in disseminating fake news and propaganda in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The use of Facebook and other social media to incite violence and conflict was documented around the globe in 2018, she said.

""Hate speech and rumors posted to Facebook facilitated violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, riots started in Sri Lanka after false news set the country's Buddhist majority against Muslims, and false rumors about child kidnappers on WhatsApp led to mob violence in India,"" Solomon said.

Is disinformation or misinformation at play in terms of the year's most prominent conspiracy theories? Solomon noted proliferation on social media over students in the Parkland school shooting being crisis actors instead of victims of violence, and over a group of migrants from Honduras who are making their way north being funded by ""rich liberals.""

Elsewhere in the culture, countless podcasts and videos have spread the absurd notion of a global cover-up that the Earth is flat rather than round. The idea of ""misinfodemics"" has surfaced in the last several years to identify the anti-vaccination movement and other beliefs that lead to real-world health crises, Solomon said.

There are distinctions between misinformation and disinformation to be emphasized.

""Disinformation would have also been a really, really interesting word of the year this year, but our choice of misinformation was very intentional,"" she said. ""Disinformation is a word that kind of looks externally to examine the behavior of others. It's sort of like pointing at behavior and saying, 'THIS is disinformation.' With misinformation, there is still some of that pointing, but also it can look more internally to help us evaluate our own behavior, which is really, really important in the fight against misinformation. It's a word of self-reflection, and in that it can be a call to action. You can still be a good person with no nefarious agenda and still spread misinformation.""

She pointed to ""Poe's law"" in slicing and dicing ""misinfo"" and ""disinfo."" The term, dating to 2005, has become an internet shorthand to sum up how easy it is to spread satire as truth online when an author's intent isn't clearly indicated.

The phrase is based on a comment one Nathan Poe posted on a Christian forum during a discussion over creationism, in which he commented: ""Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is uttrerly (sic) impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone (italics used) won't mistake for the genuine article.""

China first reported the outbreak in Wuhan on December 31, 2019. Just three days later, Thai airports were screening visitors from the city. (Thailand is among the top destinations for travelers from Wuhan.) A day later, the public health ministry set up an emergency operations center. By January 8, the first suspected COVID-19 case was detected; it was confirmed as the first outside of China on January 13.

From there, government leaders made the sensible choice to pass the reins to experts. The medical profession is highly respected in Thailand, and we have good medical schools and very affordable healthcare. Early on, healthcare workers monitored the temperatures of people arriving at airports and quarantined them if necessary; eventually everyone arriving from abroad was quarantined. (See how coronavirus has spread around the world.)

The country can't afford mass screening so contact tracing was deemed to be more effective. There are more than 1,000 epidemiological teams investigating cases and monitoring them. It seems to work well, especially since the tracing was initiated early. I followed one of the mobile COVID-testing units for a week. The team travelled to different neighbourhoods in Bangkok to provide free testing to people who’d been judged to be at risk based on contact tracing.

442,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions powerful actors such as the rich class, companies, and governments.",True,"The article discusses the actions of offshoring, evading rules and laws, and hiding resources.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects events and observations related to offshoring and secrecy jurisdictions.,True,The article highlights the secretive nature of offshoring and the use of tax havens.,"This offshoring world is dynamic, reorganizing economic, social, political and material relations among societies and also within them. Above all, it is secretive. This makes it a paradise for the rich, a vision of the world almost without government, taxes and laws, where only the powerful, their ships and their companies survive and everyone else is left — sometimes literally — to sink to the bottom.

Offshoring involves evading rules, laws, taxes, regulations or norms in ways that are either illegal or against the spirit of the law. Offshore worlds developed because of mobility systems that transport people, money, information and objects across the oceans. These include not only physical infrastructure to move cargo ships , planes, cars and trucks but also virtual infrastructure like electronic money-transfer systems and taxation, legal and financial expertise for avoiding national regulations.

One of the ways the rich have waged this war has been through offshoring: moving resources, practices, people and money from one national territory to another and hiding them within secrecy jurisdictions.

Warren Buffett once remarked that we were in the midst of a new class war. “There is class warfare, all right,” he said, “but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”

Offshoring is a key part of globalization. Throughout the 1990s, it was a widely held belief that the global movement of money, people, ideas, images, information and objects was economically, politically and culturally beneficial. Most aspects of contemporary societies were thought to have been positively transformed through increased borderlessness.

But the ’90s did not turn out to be the harbinger of an optimistic and borderless future. It turns out that there’s a dark side to constant movement. Moving across borders are many new risks, trafficked men and women, drug runners, terrorists, criminals, slave traders, smuggled workers, waste, financial risks and untaxed trillions — to name just a few downsides. They inhabit various secret spheres designed to enable movement out of sight. Central to these offshore worlds are the vast oceans.

Since some 7 billion humans are crowded onto just one-quarter of the earth’s surface, oceans provide ways to obscure what would otherwise be onshore and therefore visible. There are ships flying flags of convenience where work conditions for seafarers are driven to rock bottom. There are places in the sea where many poor migrants have lost their lives in transit to what they hoped would be a better life. Oceans are a global rubbish dump, with the great Pacific garbage patch twice the size of France.

This new global order is thus the opposite of open and transparent. It is a world of concealment, of secret gardens mainly orchestrated in and for the rich class. Tax havens are places of escape and freedom, often with nice beaches. But it’s not the sun and sand that have recalibrated the entire global economy in a few short decades. That shift is to blame on another kind of paradise — the paradise of low taxes, wealth management, deregulation and secrecy.

Since the 1980s, there has been an astonishing growth in the movement of wealth to and through the world’s 60 to 70 tax havens, which today represent at least one-quarter of existing countries. These tax havens are as likely to be in the middle of nowhere as in your own backyard. They include Switzerland, Monaco, Liechtenstein, Manhattan, the City of London, Panama, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Jersey, Delaware, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. The development of secrecy jurisdictions are core to the liberalization of the global economy that began in the 1980s, and they contributed to the ending of many currency-exchange controls — which enabled money to flow around the world and to develop the power of an unregulated shadow finance.

This rich class is the beneficiary of these havens. Almost all major companies have offshore accounts or subsidiar­ies, more than half of world trade passes through them at some point, and almost all high-net-worth individuals possess offshore accounts enabling tax planning (i.e., avoidance). Ninety-nine of Europe’s hundred largest com­panies use offshore subsidiaries. It has been calculated that one-quarter to one-third of all global wealth is held offshore.

Despite governments’ constant assertions that they are cracking down on tax evasion and avoidance, offshored money has grown from $11 billion in 1968 to $21 trillion in 2010 (equivalent to about one-third of annual world income). According to the Tax Justice Network’s calculations, fewer than 10 million people own this $21 trillion offshore fortune, a sum equivalent to the combined GDPs of the United States and Japan. This is the source of power and wealth of the superrich, with almost all owing their fortunes in part to the rapid and secret moving of money and ownership.

In “Treasure Islands,” his 2011 book about tax havens, Nicholas Shaxson shows that offshore is how the world of power now works. Money staying onshore is almost now the exception, suitable only for the little people still paying taxes. Big, institutional money is often offshored in one way or another. Shaxson describes how the United States is by a far the world’s most important secrecy jurisdiction. In the little state of Delaware, there is a single building that houses 217,000 companies. Shaxson conservatively calculates the annual loss of taxation from this offshoring world at hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars. The offshore world also makes it hard for small and medium-size companies to compete."

""It is unacceptable that, after the last 50 years' efforts to make safe and effective vaccines available, measles continues to cost lives, money and time,"" WHO's European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said, adding that she was ""taken aback"" by the high numbers.

The rate of measles has dropped in those regions by an estimated 96 percent over the past two decades and was nearly halved between 2013 and 2014.

However, according to the UN's findings, over 22,000 cases of measles were reported in seven nations across Europe and Central Asia since the beginning of 2014.

Kyrgyzstan had 7,500 cases, the highest number reported, followed by Bosnia, which reported over 5,300. Over 3,000 people in Russia contracted measles during the same time period.

In Europe, Italy and Germany reported the highest numbers, with roughly 1,600 and 570, respectively.

Jakab said the large numbers threatened to derail the goal of eliminating measles by the end of 2015 and urged health officials to work toward ""a collective response"" aimed at closing immunization gaps ""without further delay.""

On Tuesday, health officials in Berlin confirmed that an 18-month-old toddler had died of the infectious disease.

The present outbreak of measles in Germany has affected primarily residents in the country's capital since October, with a smaller outbreak reported during the same time period in Leipzig.

Experts said earlier this month that the spike in the number of measles infections in Berlin had been traced to unvaccinated refugees. At least two cases, however, appear to have originated from the United States. Public health officials in California are also currently battling a measles outbreak, the first in the US since measles was declared eliminated in 2000.

Its sudden re-emergence has been blamed on an anti-vaccination movement, whose supporters fear autism can be linked to vaccinations."

On their website, the WHO said vaccine hesitancy “threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases.” It said vaccines already prevent 2 to 3 million deaths per year, a number that could go up by an additional 1.5 million if global access to vaccinations was improved.

The WHO highlighted the dangers anti-vaxxers pose, noting the 30 percent increase in measles cases worldwide. While the WHO said that not all of these cases were a result of vaccine hesitancy, they said that the disease has seen a resurgence in several countries where it was close to being eliminated.

“The reasons why people choose not to vaccinate are complex; a vaccines advisory group to WHO identified complacency, inconvenience in accessing vaccines, and lack of confidence are key reasons underlying hesitancy,” the WHO said. “Health workers, especially those in communities, remain the most trusted advisor and influencer of vaccination decisions, and they must be supported to provide trusted, credible information on vaccines.”

Last October, the Center for Disease Control issued a report saying that the number of young children who aren’t getting vaccinated in the United States quadrupled between 2001 and 2015. This shift has led to significant measles outbreaks in the U.S. over the past several years, including one that reached over 100 people in 2018, per USA Today.

While studies have shown that uninsured and Medicaid-insured children are less likely to receive vaccinations, a significant number of children are not being vaccinated because their parents worry about alleged links between autism and vaccines. However, the CDC has said that there are no links between the two."

To critics, the steps taken on Wednesday were seen as an infringement on personal freedoms, as they make it harder for people to opt out of the traditional financial system.

Those opposed to the move argue that criminals are not the only ones to use large bills. There was a surge in demand for €500 bills during the global market panic that came after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008, according to a 2011 study by the European Central Bank. Some people no longer trusted the banking system and preferred to hold cash.

One leading German economist also accused the European Central Bank of ulterior motives. With fewer large bills, it will be easier for the central bank to push interest rates to new lows, said Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo economic research institute in Munich, which has been critical of the central bank’s cheap money policies.

That is because for almost two years the European Central Bank has been charging lenders a so-called negative interest rate to keep money in its virtual vaults, which are considered the ultimate safe haven. The policy is intended to push down market interest rates and force banks to lend money rather than hoard it. Currently the central bank deposit rate is minus 0.4 percent.

In theory, banks can avoid this de facto rent on their deposits by holding cash in their own vaults. But in practice it is expensive to store large amounts of bills safely — and it would become even more so if the denominations were smaller.

With fewer €500 notes available, the banks might be even more likely to do what the European Central Bank wants them to do, which is lend money rather than sitting on it. “It would be significantly more expensive for banks and savings banks to store lots of smaller bank notes, ” Mr. Fuest said."

In Germany, the period of the ‘30s and first half of the ‘40s, was the first time electronic mass communication was used to propagandize the masses for control.

The evil Nazi genius, Joseph Goebbels, is arguably the leading modern propagandist.

His basic propaganda to defeat the Communist Party was to present it as being evil and the Nazi Party as righteous without using any real rationale, logic or facts.

His theory: “If you repeat a lie often enough people will believe it and you will even come to believe it yourself.”

He also said, “The bigger the lie the more it will be believed,” and, “There is no need for propaganda to be rich in intellectual content.”

Americans watching cable news networks seem to see this type of propaganda in play every day. Does this system work? Yes.

Goebbels was able to talk a Christian nation into justifying the murder of millions of people.

During the night of the long knives and shortly thereafter when Hitler had Ernst Rohm (head of the SA – or Storm Battallion) murdered, Goebbels propaganda machine exposed his evil homosexual lifestyle which they had known about for years and had kept it covered up because he previously benefited them.

It sounds like what happens frequently today when politicians and notables suddenly are exposed or fall from grace yet many people knew about their socially unacceptable, immoral or illegal activities for years."

Chinese hackers are trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research, US authorities said Wednesday, ratcheting up tensions between the superpowers as markets slumped on warnings from the US Federal Reserve that prolonged shutdowns could cause ""lasting damage.""

Europe, meanwhile, pushed ahead with plans to gradually reopen for summer tourism, even as fears persist of a second wave of infections in the pandemic that has forced more than half of humanity behind closed doors in recent months.

With some countries scrambling after a fresh surge in cases and the global death toll exceeding 294,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the virus ""may never go away.""

There is no proven therapy for COVID-19. An effective vaccine could allow countries and economies to fully reopen and potentially earn millions of dollars for its creators.

Amid such high stakes, hackers linked to Beijing are attempting to steal research and intellectual property related to treatments and vaccines, two US security agencies warned.

""China's efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation's response to COVID-19,"" the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said.

Neither agency offered evidence or examples to support the allegation.

Washington, which has confirmed almost 1.4 million US cases of the virus and more than 84,000 deaths, has increasingly blamed Beijing for the outbreak that first emerged in China late last year.

Beijing has repeatedly denied the US accusations.

The value of a vaccine was underscored as Jerome Powell, head of the US Federal Reserve, cautioned Wednesday that lingering shutdowns could cause ""lasting"" economic damage.

Powell's warning burst the balloon on Wall Street, analysts said, with stocks sliding on the comments even as he also said the US economy should rebound ""substantially"" once the outbreak is reined in.

Trump, trying to jumpstart the world's largest economy as he seeks re-election this year, is pushing past warnings from health officials -- particularly top infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, who has cautioned that reopening too soon risks triggering an uncontrollable outbreak.

On Wednesday, the president dismissed Fauci's call for caution as ""not acceptable,"" and in an excerpt of an interview with Fox Business to air in full on Thursday, Trump said: ""I totally disagree with him on schools.""

Some hint of the cost of moving too quickly could be seen in European markets, given a further mauling by data showing fresh outbreaks in South Korea and Germany.

Russia, now the country with the second-highest number of virus cases, recorded more than 10,000 new infections after authorities this week eased stay-at-home orders.

Fears were also growing of a second wave in China, with the northeastern city of Jilin put in partial lockdown and Wuhan, where the virus was first detected last year, planning to test its entire population after clusters of new cases.

Still, with no vaccine in sight and dire economic data pointing to the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, many countries were trying to navigate reopening.

Desperate to save millions of tourism jobs, the European Union set out plans for a phased restart of travel this summer, with border controls to be eventually lifted and measures to minimize infections, like wearing masks on shared transport.

In France, some beaches reopened on Wednesday -- but only for swimming and fishing, while sunbathing remained prohibited.

People in England were allowed to leave their homes more freely, as data showed the British economy shrinking by two percent in January-March, its fastest slump since 2008 -- and with a far worse contraction to come.

Elsewhere, cases were surging. Chile imposed a total lockdown in its capital Santiago after a 60 percent leap in infections over the past 24 hours.

Argentine officials were watching Buenos Aires warily after one of its poorest and most densely populated neighborhoods showed a spike in infections. Water had been cut off in Villa 31 for eight days.

Brazil is emerging as a new global hotspot despite President Jair Bolsonaro dismissing the pandemic as a ""little flu.""

Health experts have warned of potentially devastating consequences as the virus spreads through the developing world, where health care systems are under-funded and isolation is often not possible.

In northern Nigeria, fears that the virus is spreading have seen hospitals shut their doors to the sick.

Civil servant Binta Mohammed said she had to watch her husband die from ""diabetic complications.""

""The four private hospitals we took him to refused to admit him for fear he had the virus,"" she said.

But there were stories of hope, including two centenarians who survived the virus.

In Spain, 113-year-old Maria Branyas fought off the illness during weeks of isolation at a retirement home where several other residents died from the disease.

And in Russia, 100-year-old Pelageya Poyarkova clutched a bouquet of red roses as she was discharged from a Moscow hospital after her own recovery.

COVID-19, the greatest public health crisis of the generation, has skyrocketed vaccines to the top of the global agenda.

As “the most important public health intervention in history”, Mr. Guterres credited the “lifesaving miracle” of vaccinations, for saving tens of millions of lives each year, eradicating smallpox and preventing outbreaks of diseases like measles, rubella and tetanus.

He maintained that a COVID-19 vaccine must be seen as “a global public good – a people’s vaccine”.

The UN chief lauded the “incredible work” of GAVI, the vaccine alliance, and its partners in allowing people of all ages and income levels throughout the world to access vaccines.

“The United Nations is proud to be part of this effort towards universal health coverage”, he upheld, reiterating its commitment to being part of the next phase, “because there is still much work to do”.

Against the backdrop of 20 million children missing their full complement of vaccines and one-in-five having received no vaccines at all, Mr. Guterres pointed out that under the shadow of COVID-19, “their plight is even more desperate”.

He painted a picture of halted immunization campaigns and broadening gaps in global vaccine delivery.

The Secretary-General appealed for three main commitments, beginning with finding safe ways to continue delivering vaccinations, “even as COVID-19 spreads”.

Secondly, he asked that vaccine-delivery networks be used to deliver a range of other primary health services.

And finally, when the COVID-19 vaccine does become available, that it reaches everyone.

“Disease know no borders”, concluded the UN chief, “that is why a fully funded GAVI will be critical to ensure we continue to progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)”.

Chaired by the United Kingdom, leaders from around the world outlined their latest thinking during the summit, on the need for, and progress towards, an equitable vaccine

""Vaccines work, and 86 per cent of the world’s children have been reached by routine immunization”, said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “In the midst of a global pandemic it has never been more important to build capacity to respond to disease outbreaks and work with organizations to deliver vaccines"".

The King of Jordan, Abdullah bin Al Hussein, called guaranteed equal access “not only the moral and just approach, it is also in the interest of the entire international community… It is our responsibility as an international community to make sure the most vulnerable are not left behind"".

Egypt’s President, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, maintained that it was ""pivotal” not to allow the pandemic to affect the importance of fighting other infectious diseases or “to exert collective efforts to resume immunization campaigns against vaccine-preventable diseases"".

Ethiopia President, Sahle-Work Zewde, underscored the importance of inoculations by saying that her country had boosted routine immunization from 30 per cent in 2000, to 72 per cent today, spelling out that “since 2018, 1.1 million girls have been spared from the scourge of cervical cancer due to the introduction of the HPV vaccine”.

Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed Germany’s continued support, saying, ""We want to increase the chance for more than 300 million young people to have a healthy life. We are talking about 300 million individual lives – not just a number.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: “Together, we have replenished this Alliance and here comes the number you’ve been waiting for: we have secured a fantastic $ 8.8 billion for GAVI's vital work over the next five years""."

American censors took exception to parts of the film, specifically scenes featuring sodomy between Saddam Hussein and Satan. Consequently, the film was substantially cut, and was given an R certificate, meaning those under the age of 17 have to be accompanied by an adult.

A Christian website, crosstalk.com, describes the film as “intentionally immoral, with the most vile content in the history of mainstream movie-making; 340 counted obscenities… 14 profanities and many disgusting bodily functions, including vomiting, bloody violence… extreme sex including homosexuality and paedophilia… this is a blasphemous, evil movie. EVIL.”

In the UK, the film has been granted a 15 certificate, allowing anyone over that age to see it unaccompanied, and not a frame was chopped.

A spokesman for the BBFC explained: “You can’t really generalise, but the Americans are very strict about sexual material above all else. We didn’t have a problem with anything in the film.”

Ironically, the film’s full title is South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut and pokes fun at the hypocrisy of most censorship regarding war, violence and sex.

Trey Parker, who together with Matt Stone create South Park, hit out at the current “climate of fear” in the wake of the Columbine massacre and the hypocrisy of the US censors, he declared: “It’s just scary – going through the trailer process and getting the notes back (from the censors) that say, ‘You just can’t fart.’ It’s like, the shot of the guy shooting the M60 and all these people getting shot – that was OK. But the guy farting has to go.”

They can be thought of as mutual solutions, or melts, of rock-forming components that are variously present as simple ions, as complex ions and ionic groups, and as molecules. The most abundant of the simple ions in common magmas are such singly and doubly charged cations as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+. Because these ions can move about rather freely in the system, they occupy no fixed positions with respect to other ions that are present. In contrast, the smaller and more highly charged cations, notably Si4+, Al3+, and (to a lesser degree) Fe3+, are surrounded or screened by O2− ions and other anions (negative ions) to form parts of relatively stable complex ions such as (SiO )4−, (AlO )5−, and (FeO )9−. Simple anions, including F−, Cl−, O2−, and (OH)−, ordinarily are present in much smaller amounts. Water, hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), carbon dioxide (CO ), and other volatile molecular substances occur as well, generally in equilibrium with ionic forms such as (OH)−, Cl−, F−, and (CO )2−.

Because the bond that unites silicon and oxygen is a remarkably strong one, (SiO )4− ions are stable in magmas even at exceedingly high temperatures. They also tend to join with one another, or polymerize, to form more complex anionic groups, a tendency that is especially great in the more silicic magmas. The joining is accomplished by a sharing of oxygen ions between adjacent silicon ions to form Si-O-Si bridges like those in many silicate and aluminosilicate minerals; in the simplest such case, (Si O )6− ions are the result. Because the (AlO )5− ions also have a strong tendency to polymerize, most of the large ionic groups in magmas probably contain both silicon and aluminum ions. These groups, which resemble the frameworks of many rock-forming minerals but are geometrically less regular, significantly affect the viscosity and crystallization of magmas.

The viscosity of magmas, which spans an enormous range of values, affects their flow behaviour, the movements of crystals and inclusions of foreign matter within them, the diffusion of materials through them, the growth of crystals from them, and the explosivity of eruptions (when aided by growth of gas bubbles near the surface). Lava flows are thin and rapid for low-viscosity magmas, but thick and slow for viscous flows. Fluid magma promotes the growth of large crystals such as the ones found in pegmatites, but crystal growth is prevented in viscous magmas, which usually are quenched as glass. Highly explosive eruptions such as occurred at Mount St. Helens commonly result from gas bubbles nucleating, growing, and rising in a highly viscous magma. It can be demonstrated thermodynamically that the overpressure (excess rock pressure) developed in growing and rising bubbles is inversely proportional to their radii. In fluid magmas, gas bubbles grow large in size and rise quickly, which causes their pressures to be expended; hence, only a spectacular fountaining of hot lava is observed at the surface. In contrast, a viscous magma prevents the growth of bubbles, so that they will rise slowly while retaining excess pressure; as a result, the associated volcano erupts violently. Energies equivalent to the amount produced by several nuclear bombs are released in such explosions. Viscosity increases greatly with decreasing temperature and less markedly with increasing pressure. It also can be governed in part by the amount and distribution of any solid materials or bubbles of gas present, which both tend to increase viscosity. Finally, it varies considerably among magmas of differing gross composition, mainly because of the differences in the degree of Si-O and Al-O polymerization. Thus, highly silicic magmas generally are more viscous than mafic ones by several orders of magnitude, a difference reflected by contrasts in the eruptive behaviour of rhyolitic and basaltic lavas. Basaltic magmas at 1,100 °C can be at least 100,000 times more viscous than water at room temperature, whereas rhyolitic magmas at 800 °C are at least 10 million times more viscous than room-temperature water. The presence of volatile constituents can markedly increase the fluidity of magmas, even those that are rich in SiO . This effect has been attributed to the breaking of Si-O-Si bridges through substitution of ions such as F− and (OH)− for shared O2− ions in elements of the polymerized groups.

A typical magma can be broadly viewed as an assemblage of relatively large and rather closely packed oxygen ions, among which some cations have considerable mobility; others, such as Si4+ and Al3+, tend to occupy positions that are more fixed. The entire system is a dynamic one, however, and even the largest of the Si-O and Al-O ion groups are constantly changing form and position as bonds are broken and new ones are established. If the magma quickly loses thermal energy and cools to a glass, these internal movements are sharply restricted, and the various constituents become essentially frozen in position. If cooling is slower, the contained complex ions and polymerized ion groups have time to assume more regular arrangements and to be stabilized by cations of appropriate size, charge, and other properties. Crystalline solids are thereby formed. Their regular internal structure is relatively conserving of space, and so they have somewhat higher specific gravities than the magma from which they were nourished."

Though India showed a surge in new cases during the past few days, the average CFR is relatively low at 2.9%, or one death per every 35 confirmed cases; this is less than half of the global average CFR based on 215 countries, at 6.3%, whereas the CFR for France, Italy, the UK, and Spain ranges from 11.4–15.5%, or one death per every 6 to 9 confirmed cases, followed by Brazil at 6.2%, the US at 5.9%, and Iran at 5.4%. Russia showed the lowest CFR of 1.0% of the 12 worst-affected countries. Germany, considered the model for containment of Covid-19 deaths, has a CFR considerably higher than that of India, at 4.6%.

The surge in cases in India can be attributed to the recent easing of the lockdown combined with an increase in the testing capacity. Due to the ease in lockdown and a significant increase in testing, India is expected to see a peak in cases sometime in June or July. However, the success story for any country relies on how good it is at controlling the deaths from the pandemic, and India has proved to be successful in doing so.



The low mortality rate in India can be attributed to its youthful population structure, the hot temperature, and a milder strain of the virus. Additionally, the early, stringent, and prolonged lockdown helped in averting the expected exponential growth in the new cases and deaths. A recent estimate by the Public Health Foundation of India stated that 78,000 deaths due to Covid-19 have been averted due to the effective implementation of mitigation measures by the government of India. Covid-19 is a highly contagious disease and thus it is not surprising to see a surge in the number of cases, but what could be of concern is controlling the deaths from the virus.

So far, India has tested more than 3.0 million of its population, and the proportion of confirmed cases among the tested population stands at 4.8%, which may translate to an estimated 66.0 million Covid-19 cases currently present in India, assuming that the testing is being carried out on random samples of the population. The real extent of the spread of the pandemic can only be studied through widespread testing of the population. Apart from continuing to use the gold-standard reverse transcriptase, polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, antibody blood tests are also a good measure to study the population immunity towards the virus, and will also help us to know the number of people who are infected and/or recovered from the virus in the population. If results of the antibody tests are made available, it is possible that approximately 6.0–8.0% of the Indian population might be already infected and recovered from the pandemic. Antibody tests conducted in small samples of the US population have shown that 10–20% of the population samples tested were positive for antibodies; however, these studies have been too small to make any solid conclusion. Additionally, in India and the rest of the world, many people who get infected by the virus are either asymptomatic or with mild infection. Therefore, as the testing capacity increases, more and more cases can be identified in the early stages and therefore better care can be provided to patients, which can further reduce the CFR.

The CFR in this analysis is based on the reported deaths by each country. It is possible that there can be variations in defining the deaths from Covid-19 as there is currently no international standard. For example, if a person dies from a heart attack while recovering from Covid-19, is this person counted in Covid-19 deaths or heart attack deaths? Therefore, once the excess mortality data becomes available for each country, a more accurate CFR estimate can be done in the coming months.

In a two-page letter to several House and Senate committees last week, but disclosed for the first time on Monday, the inspectors general responsible for coronavirus relief oversight said an “ambiguity” in the main coronavirus response law — the CARES Act — allowed administration officials to sharply limit how much of the law’s spending requirements they must collect and report. This narrow interpretation of the law, the inspectors general warn, would dramatically impede their ability to gather information about some of the most expansive programs in the law, from the $670 billion Paycheck Protection Program to the $454 billion Treasury fund to protect businesses and industries damaged by the outbreak.

The legal opinions are the latest squeeze put on inspectors general by the Trump administration, which has gradually chipped away at the ability of internal watchdogs to monitor aspects of the administration’s conduct independently. The letter from the inspectors general, by The Washington Post, was signed by the Justice Department inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who leads a panel of inspectors general charged with coronavirus-related oversight known as the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, and its executive director, Robert Westbrooks."

Jarvis took great pains to acquire and defend her role as “Mother of Mother's Day,” and to focus the day on children celebrating their mothers. (Read more about Mother's Day's early years.)

“Howe called for women to gather once a year in parlors, churches, or social halls, to listen to sermons, present essays, sing hymns or pray if they wished—all in the name of promoting peace,” said Katharine Antolini, an historian at West Virginia Wesleyan College and author of Memorializing Motherhood: Anna Jarvis and the Struggle for Control of Mother's Day.

Frank Hering, a former football coach and faculty member at University of Notre Dame, also proposed the idea of a Mother's Day before Anna Jarvis. In 1904 Hering urged an Indianapolis gathering of the Fraternal Order of Eagles to support “setting aside of one day in the year as a nationwide memorial to the memory of Mothers and motherhood.” (See pictures of animal mothers and their babies.)

""Do me the justice of refraining from furthering the selfish interests of this claimant,"" Jarvis wrote, ""who is making a desperate effort to snatch from me the rightful title of originator and founder of Mother’s Day, established by me after decades of untold labor, time, and expense.""

“She called those charities Christian pirates,” Antolini said. “Today most of us would think it was wonderful to use the day to raise funds to support poor mothers or families of World War I veterans or another worthy group but she hated them for that.”

Much of the reason why, Antolini says, is that in the days before charity watchdog organizations Jarvis simply didn't trust fundraisers to deliver the money to the people it was supposed to help. “She resented the idea that profiteers would use the day as just another way of making money,"" Antolini says.

“To have Mother’s Day the burdensome, wasteful, expensive gift day that Christmas and other special days have become, is not our pleasure,"" she wrote in the 1920s. “If the American people are not willing to protect Mother’s Day from the hordes of money schemers that would overwhelm it with their schemes, then we shall cease having a Mother’s Day—and we know how.”"

But many technical and societal barriers remain.

Even before they got to the sessions, the scientists had to contend with a smattering of activists with drums, cameras, and a megaphone alleging that the government is already performing geoengineering through the spraying of particles, in so-called chemtrails.

Physicist David Keith of the University of Calgary in Canada addressed the concept of spreading aerosol droplets in the stratosphere, where they could block a small fraction of the sun's rays. A paper published last year in Environmental Research Letters suggested that the leading proposal, spraying sulfur dioxide gas, wouldn't work. Sulfur dioxide is converted in the atmosphere into droplets of sulfuric acid, which would clump and fall out of the sky before they could have much cooling effect. To get around this problem, Keith and colleagues have proposed using airplanes to spray droplets of the acid itself, rather than sulfur dioxide. In unpublished data, the team found that injecting only “a few megatons per year” of sulfuric acid could be more than twice as effective at blocking radiation as starting with sulfur dioxide.

While scientists are finding ways to overcome the engineering challenges, the environmental effects of planet-hacking techniques remain uncertain. One challenge in geoengineering a warmed planet is simultaneously restoring temperatures while minimizing disruption of rain and precipitation. (Stratospheric particles lower the total amount of energy striking Earth, the driver of precipitation.)

In previous modeling efforts, adding sun-blocking particles uniformly across the globe has tended to undercool the poles while overcooling the equator. So Kenneth Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, California, modeled various approaches to try to counteract a severe warming—the result of a doubling of preindustrial CO concentration. In work yet to be published, he distributed the particles unevenly to try to minimize those effects; for example, by putting more at the poles versus the equator. (Global warming is greatest in the Arctic.) In models, that strategy helped fix the undercooling/overcooling problem, but it worsened the effects on precipitation. “There's a complex problem of how do you balance the damage that you do against the benefit,” said Caldeira.

That said, simulating either geoengineering approach to counteract global warming—distributing particles globally or focusing on the poles—suggests a cooler world with less disruption of rain patterns than one in which warming continues unabated. “In a high-global-warming world, more people would be better off with geoengineering, but some people would be worse off,” he said."

The core symptoms are distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience. These symptoms can undermine the work of an otherwise gifted executive.

As our minds fill with noise—feckless synaptic events signifying nothing—the brain gradually loses its capacity to attend fully and thoroughly to anything.

The symptoms of ADT come upon a person gradually. The sufferer doesn’t experience a single crisis but rather a series of minor emergencies while he or she tries harder and harder to keep up. Shouldering a responsibility to “suck it up” and not complain as the workload increases, executives with ADT do whatever they can to handle a load they simply cannot manage as well as they’d like. The ADT sufferer, therefore, feels a constant low level of panic and guilt. Facing a tidal wave of tasks, the executive becomes increasingly hurried, curt, peremptory, and unfocused, while pretending that everything is fine.

BRIC leaders will hold their first summit meeting in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg on June 16 to discuss the global financial crisis and reforms to the world’s financial and trade institutions.

Here are some facts about the BRIC countries.

* The term BRICs was coined by U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs to describe the four key emerging economic powers, which the bank predicted would account for an increasingly greater share of the global economy.

* Together, the BRICs accounted for about 22 percent of the world economy in 2008, up from 16 percent a decade earlier, based on the widely followed measure of purchasing power parity.

* Real economic growth from 1999 through 2008 averaged 9.75 percent in China, 7 percent in both India and Russia, and 3.3 percent in Brazil.

* China, a global manufacturing center, held $727 billion in U.S. Treasuries at the end of 2008 and analysts estimate two-thirds of its roughly $2 trillion in foreign reserves are parked in dollar assets.

* Brazil is already an agricultural and mining powerhouse, and could become a major player in the world energy market after finding huge deep-sea oil reserves. It is the only BRIC country without nuclear weapons but it has the capacity to enrich uranium. After a five-year run of rapid growth, Brazil’s economy slipped into recession in the first quarter.

* Russia is the world’s second-largest oil exporter but the global financial crisis and a fall in oil prices last year triggered its worst recession in at least a decade. The economy is expected to contract by 6 percent in 2009 and President Dmitry Medvedev faces soaring unemployment and wage cuts that could undermine political stability, although the recent recovery in oil prices has helped.

* India is the only other large economy besides China that is on track to post robust growth this year, in part due to its vast domestic market. It faces potential trouble from domestic militant groups and a long-running border dispute with Pakistan.

* The BRICs want to reduce the world’s reliance on a weak U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency; among the options are a basket of currencies or a system of drawing rates. Brazil is pursuing trade in local currency with China, but analysts caution that Beijing is wary of rocking the boat because of its $1.95 trillion in reserves, of which two-thirds are in U.S. dollars.

* The BRICs want more representation in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Discussions to change the voting power in the IMF are about to get underway in a review that has been brought forward by two years to reassure the BRICs that their concerns are being addressed.

* India and Brazil, along with Japan and Germany, are seeking a seat on the U.N. Security Council but a lack of consensus among current council members has long stalled reforms. The United States wants Japan in the council, but China objects.

* Brazil hopes to forge a common BRIC position on global climate talks but their carbon footprints and resulting negotiating positions differ sharply. Russia, the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the United States, ratified the Kyoto protocol in 2004 while developing countries are not expected to agree to legally binding emissions targets from 2013.

All are in bad stead with church elders.

Harmston said church leaders expelled him in October for preaching doctrine no longer accepted by the church. But some say hundreds of others have been disciplined recently for such things as criticizing President Bush's new world order and being too preoccupied with the end of the world.

""Clearly, it's spiritual abuse,"" said Harmston, 52, a retired college business teacher and lifelong Mormon.

Manti, a town of 2,500 tucked in a remote valley in the Wasatch Mountains two hours south of Salt Lake City, is at the center of the powerful church's growing concern over archconservative, superpatriotic fundamentalists who predict that doomsday will arrive as soon as April 6, 2000. Many of those targeted are well-armed and conspiracy-minded survivalists who have retreated to the mountains to await Armageddon.

""We're always concerned with extreme views. That is something that has worried us for some time,"" said Bruce Olsen, the church's managing director of public affairs in Salt Lake City.

Mormon leaders, who refuse to discuss excommunications, say reports of a widespread purge are ""exaggerated."" But church members in south-central Utah say Mormon elders last fall circulated several lists of ""troublesome"" habits, such as meeting in splinter study groups, hoarding food, preaching about conspiracies by political leaders and possessing videotapes discussing signs that doomsday is near.

""People who believe the last days are imminent have not been targeted by the church until now, certainly not like this,"" said Paul Toscano, president of the Mormon Alliance, a Salt Lake City group that advocates fairness for church members who have been disciplined. ""But church leaders have what they feel are very good reasons. They don't want to be perceived as kooks.""

Many believe the ultraconservative fringe is an embarrassment to leaders of the Mormon church. With 8.4 million members around the globe and 45,000 missionaries is it is one of the world's fastest growing churches.

A rising extremist movement within the church also could subject Mormons to the kind of public ridicule and ostracism it has endured in its 165-year history, mainly because of its now-renounced belief in polygamy.

Church critics said fear of an extremist movement peaked in recent months as the disparate groups of fundamentalists rallied around the presidential candidacy of James ""Bo"" Gritz, a Vietnam War veteran and Mormon convert whose Populist Party campaign slogan was ""God, guns and Gritz.""

Gritz's speeches warn of global conspiracies and an approaching apocalypse.

In Utah, Gritz received 28,000 votes on Nov. 3, and residents say it was hard to find a car bumper in central Utah without a Gritz sticker on it. He won only 2,800 votes in his home state of Nevada.

Mormon officials confirm they are concerned about the ultraconservative factions but deny that Gritz's popularity is the reason. They say members have been disciplined for false preaching and leading other members astray, not for their politics or behavior.

The remote reaches of the Rocky Mountain states long have served as a retreat for gun-toting, Christian survivalists escaping what they see as a fast-deteriorating world.

Mnay have joined the Mormon church because of its teachings of an approaching, end-of-the-world salvation. But now some have accused the church of turning its back on its own doctrines and becoming too wrapped up in politics and finance.

The fundamentalists interpret many current events, from the rise of the European Community to the placement of computer bar codes on toothpaste tubes, as fulfilling Mormon prophecies that the ""end times"" are near.

They see the ""new world order"" as part of a predicted conspiracy by Jews, lawyers and bankers to promote a ""one world"" government that would deny the political and religious rights protected by the divinely inspired U.S. Constitution.

And, through measures such as storing large quantities of food, they are preparing for a chaotic global breakdown marked by an explosion of violence among the black and Hispanic urban masses and turmoil in the Third World.

For support, fundamentalists point to the early speeches of Mormon President Ezra Taft Benson, believed by church members to be a living prophet. But Benson backed away from his ultraconservative views after rising to the head of the church, and now, at 93, he is rarely heard or seen in public. He was hospitalized last week with pneumonia.

The dissidents complain that the church is violating their freedom to speak and worship by punishing them.

Ron Garff of Salt Lake City said he faces bankruptcy after the church ordered him, on threat of excommunication, to shut down his videotape business. Three of Garff's religious tapes contained predictions that the Christian millenium will arrive in the year 2000.

A young mother from Manti, who received her excommunication letter in early December, said church elders asked her and her husband at a disciplinary hearing whether they were supporters of Gritz.

The woman, a friend of Harmston, said she has more than a year's supply of food at her house and recently began teaching her four childen at home because the local school taught them about the ""new world order.""

""We're becoming self-sufficient,"" said the woman, who did not want to be named because her Mormon family does not know she has been forced from the church. ""But now we're being labeled as doomsayers."""

But his speech made no reference to what his administration may do to bail out the troubled US car industry and also did not mention a second economic stimulus package, both measures backed by President-elect Barack Obama.

Within shouting distance of the New York Stock Exchange, the outgoing president told his audience at Federal Hall: ""This is a decisive moment for the global economy.

""In the wake of the financial crisis, voices from the left and right are equating the free enterprise system with greed, exploitation, and failure.

""It is true that this crisis included failures - by lenders and borrowers, by financial firms, by governments and independent regulators. But the crisis was not a failure of the free market system. And the answer is not to try to reinvent the system.""

He said the solution was to ""fix the problems we face, make the reforms we need, and move forward with the free market principles that have delivered prosperity and hope to people around the world"".

Mr Bush said capitalism was ""not perfect"" but it was ""by far the most efficient and just way of structuring an economy"".

""The record is unmistakable: If you seek economic growth, if you seek opportunity, if you seek social justice and human dignity, the free market system is the way to go,"" he said.

""And it would a terrible mistake to allow a few months of crisis to undermine 60 years of success."""

Wakefield himself was struck off the medical register in the UK. But the ripples surrounding his claims are still being felt all over the world – as anti-vaccine movements continue to drive down inoculation rates, particularly in developed countries. The result has been outbreaks of measles in Europe and the United states – where it was once almost eradicated. The scandal also played a key role in undermining trust in science.

The recommendation, reported Friday by The New York Times, came more than two years after Petraeus, a retired four-star army general, quit the top intelligence post as news circulated of his extramarital affair.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will ultimately decide whether to seek an indictment.

The probe focused on whether Petraeus gave biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell access to classified information — including access to his CIA email account — during his two-year stint as intelligence chief.

FBI agents probing potential security leaks discovered classified documents on Broadwell's computer after Petraeus resigned in November 2012.

But Petraeus has denied passing classified information, and President Barack Obama, speaking shortly after the Petraeus resignation, said he had no evidence that the retired general had disclosed any information threatening national security.

The Times report said the delay in the decision on whether to pursue the case had frustrated some law enforcement officials and prosecutors.

It said questions arose about whether Petraeus, an Obama CIA appointee, had received preferential treatment at a time when Holder was leading a crackdown on government officials who disclose sensitive information to journalists."

Mitch McConnell Says Obama 'Should Have Kept His Mouth Shut' on Trump — Like Bush

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that President Barack Obama ""should have kept his mouth shut"" after the former president said Donald Trump administration's novel coronavirus response has been ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" in a private call that was recorded last week.

""I think it's a little bit classless, frankly, to critique an administration that comes after you,"" Sen. McConnell, a Republican, told President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump during an appearance on a Trump 2020 campaign live stream.

""You had your shot, you were there for eight years,"" said McConnell, 78. ""I think the tradition that the Bushes set up — of not critiquing the president who comes after you — is a good tradition.""

Obama, 58, has largely followed the tradition of former presidents staying out of current administration's politics, with the exception of his political endorsements as well as periodic tweets usually obliquely referencing the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus and Trump's rollback of Obama-era environmental policies.

Obama's sharp criticism of the Trump administration came during a private phone call last Friday with former members of his administration and escalated his public opposition to the White House's decisions amid the pandemic.

The former president had previously not-so-subtly referenced Trump's shortcomings in tweets, including in late April when he wrote that the U.S. was still waiting for ""a coherent national plan” to combat the coronavirus.

Obama has, however, never mentioned Trump on Twitter by name while the president has tweeted about Obama at least 16 times this year (including three times in the past week).

Trump, 73 — whose anti-Obama opinions stretch back to when he popularized the debunked racist conspiracy theory that Obama wasn't born in America — also routinely brings up Obama during press conferences and interviews, last week calling members of the Obama administration ""human scum.""

Meanwhile, the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic climbed past 80,000 this week, according to available data. The New York Times reports there's been more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus, while federal health officials told the Senate on Tuesday morning that the number of deaths and total cases is likely higher than the reported number.

In response to the scrutiny the federal government has received for its coronavirus response — particularly issues with testing kits and Trump's changing tone over the seriousness of the virus — the president has argued his administration was unprepared for the pandemic because of Obama-era decisions.

""President Trump’s coronavirus response has been unprecedented and saved American lives. While Democrats were pursuing a sham witch hunt against President Trump, President Trump was shutting down travel from China. While Democrats encouraged mass gatherings, President Trump was deploying PPE [personal protective equipment], ventilators and testing across the country. As Gov. Cuomo said, President Trump’s response has been 'phenomenal.' There has been a bipartisan recognition of President Trump’s leadership, and the American people have taken notice.""

On Monday, Trump claimed during a press conference at the White House that Obama was behind the ""biggest political crime in American history,"" but he would not say what crime he was accusing his predecessor of committing.

“You know what the crime is,"" Trump told reporters. ""The crime is very obvious to everybody, all you have to do is read the newspapers.”

The accelerated attacks between the current and former administration come as the 2020 presidential election looms closer and Democrats begin to rally behind former Vice President Joe Biden in taking on Trump come November.

“This election that’s coming up on every level is so important because what we’re going to be battling is not just a particular individual or a political party,"" Obama said, according to Yahoo News, which obtained audio of his call with former administration members. ""What we’re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy — that has become a stronger impulse in American life."""

Mr Soros, who famously bet against the pound on Black Wednesday, was caught on the wrong side of the rise in stocks and US government bond yields following Mr Trump’s shock victory.

Markets rose on hopes that the president-elect would slash business taxes and stimulate economic growth with projects such as a wall on the Mexican border. The S&P 500 index of American stocks has risen 5.6pc since the election.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Soros took a cautious stance going into the election and became even more bearish after the result became clear on November 9.

He was a supporter of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and committed to give $25m to Democratic causes last year.

Despite the unexpected surge after the vote, Soros Fund Management is said to have grown 5pc over the past year.

The hedge fund tycoon has a track record of bold bets in times of political strain. His aggressive short position against the pound as Britain crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 earned him around $1bn and gained him a reputation as the man who broke the Bank of England."
473,True,"The article discusses a conspiracy theory about a pizza restaurant being the center of a sprawling plot involving the occult, child sex slaves, and Democratic leaders.",True,The article mentions Edgar Maddison Welch as the gunman who fired the rifle and Alex Jones as a prominent conspiracy theorist who spread the story.,True,The article mentions Welch driving to the restaurant to 'self-investigate' the conspiracy theory and firing the rifle at a locked closet door.,True,"The article mentions Welch's belief that he was raiding a pedo ring and standing up against a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures, and rapes babies and children.",True,"The article mentions the false story spreading on anonymous message boards, forums, and websites, and how it crept into the president's circle.",True,The article mentions the false story being amplified by spurious websites and how Welch believed he was doing a public service by raiding a pedo ring.,"The gunman who fired an AR-15 rifle in a Washington DC pizza restaurant as he “self-investigated” a bogus conspiracy theory pleaded guilty on Friday, the same day a prominent conspiracy theorist apologized for spreading the story.

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to two charges, assault with a dangerous weapon and interstate transport of a firearm, in exchange for prosecutors dropping a third charge that carried a five-year minimum sentence.

In early December last year, Welch drove from his home in North Carolina to the Comet Ping Pong restaurant, which he had heard was the center of a sprawling, plot involving the occult, child sex slaves and Democratic leaders such as John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

Welch later told police he wanted to “self-investigate” the fictitious online rumors, which began after Podesta’s hacked emails, released by WikiLeaks, showed he had considered a possible fundraiser with the pizzeria’s owner.

Those emails transformed into a conspiracy about child abuse on the anonymous message board 4chan, seeped out on to forums like Reddit and Facebook, and were amplified by spurious websites such as InfoWars, which is run by Alex Jones, a prominent conspiracy theorist who has interviewed Donald Trump.

The false story crept into the president’s circle last December. Michael G Flynn, who was on Trump’s transition team with his father, the retired general Michael T Flynn, tweeted his belief that the so-called “pizzagate” conspiracy would “remain a story” until “proven to be false”. Trump ordered Flynn’s son fired.

According to texts cited by prosecutors, Welch believed he was doing a public service.

“Raiding a pedo ring, possibly sacraficing [sic] the lives of a few for the lives of many,” Welch wrote to one friend. “Standing up against a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures and rapes ­babies and children in our own back yard.”

He added: “I’m sorry bro, but I’m tired of turning the channel and hoping someone does something and being thankful it’s not my family. One day it will be our families. The world is too afraid to act and I’m too stubborn not to.”

When he went to Washington, Welch took with him the assault weapon, a .38 revolver and a 12-gauge shotgun. When he walked into the restaurant, diners, including families with children, fled in panic.

According to court documents, Welch fired the rifle several times at a locked closet door, damaging computer equipment, and aimed the gun at an employee who had entered the back of the restaurant and promptly ran back out. No one was injured.

Welch later said he regretted his actions.

The court set Welch’s sentencing hearing for 22 June. He faces between 18 and 60 months in prison, though prosecutors have not indicated how severe a sentence they will seek. In his guilty plea, Welch agreed to pay about $5,700 for damage done to the restaurant.

Also on Friday, Jones apologized for promoting the conspiracy. In a nearly six-minute video, he read a statement in which he apologized to James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, and tried to minimize his role in spreading the rumors.

“I made comments about Mr Alefantis that in hindsight I regret, and for which I apologize to him,” Jones said. “We relied on third-party accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant. We also relied on accounts of reporters who are no longer with us.”

The InfoWars story, Jones admitted, “was based upon what we now believe was an incorrect narrative”. He said that he did not believe Alefantis had any legal claim against InfoWars, which has taken its relevant broadcasts offline.

“We are issuing this statement because we think it is the right thing to do,” Jones said. “It is never easy to admit when your commentaries are based on inaccurate information, but we feel like we owe it to you, the listeners, viewers and supporters, to make that statement, and give an apology to you and to Mr Alefantis.”

As the story spread last fall, Alefantis and his employees received hundreds of death threats. In a statement on Friday, the restaurant owner said that the apology, “while welcome, does nothing to address the harm he and his company have done to me, my business, and my community”.

Jones claims that he sometimes speaks with the president by phone. Before his election, Trump sat for an interview with the InfoWars host.

Both men have spread false stories that “thousands” of American Muslims cheered the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, that Barack Obama was not born in the US, and that Senator Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy.

After five years of promoting the falsehood about Obama’s birth certificate, Trump admitted last fall that Obama was American.

“We encourage you to hold us accountable,” Jones said on Friday. “We improve when you do.”"

Last week, remarks by Obama were leaked to Yahoo News that were highly critical about Trump and his administration, seeming to break a convention in US politics that former occupants of the White House rarely criticize their successors.

Speaking to alumni of his administration, Obama said he was worried about the “rule of law”, in light of the justice department’s decision to drop its case against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn. That’s the issue at the heart of Trump’s attempts to gin up an “Obamagate” scandal, which on Tuesday morning he again claimed “makes Watergate look small time!”

Obama also said the response to the coronavirus pandemic had been “an absolute chaotic disaster”.

McConnell was speaking to Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump in an online fundraiser on Monday night.

Asked about Obama “slamming” the administration for its response to the coronavirus outbreak, he said: “I think President Obama should have kept his mouth shut.

“You know, we know he doesn’t like much this administration is doing. That’s understandable. But I think it’s a little bit classless frankly to critique an administration that comes after you.”

He added: “You had your shot. You were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bushes set up of not critiquing the president who comes after you is a good tradition.”

There is a tradition of former presidents not commenting on or attacking their successors in the Oval Office, but Trump is not part of the informal club which currently includes Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and he has regularly attacked those who went before him.

Plus, Obama’s views of Trump are pretty well known, if usually by indirect routes and leaks to the press. For example, in a Hulu documentary about Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign against Trump, the Virginia senator Tim Kaine is seen to say the then president thinks Trump is a fascist.

In the remarks leaked to Yahoo News, Obama said he would be hitting the campaign trail for Joe Biden this fall to help him try to unseat Trump and make him a one-term president. Biden leads Trump in key swing states and national polling and McConnell is also presiding over a Senate majority that now looks increasingly at risk as Republican popularity dips."

Fighting intensified to the north and south of Saddam Hussein's hometown yesterday as Iraqi security forces vowed to reach the centre of Tikrit within 48 hours.

Video from the village of Ouja, just south of Tikrit, shows all that remains of Hussein's once-lavish tomb are the support columns that held up the roof. Poster-sized pictures of Saddam, which once adorned the mausoleum, are now nowhere to be seen amid the piles of rubble.

Instead of the posters of the executed dictator, Shiite militia flags and photos of militia leaders can be seen throughout the predominantly Sunni village, including that of Major General Qassem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian general advising Iraqi Shiite militias on the battlefield.

'This is one of the areas where IS militants massed the most because Saddam's grave is here,' said Captain Yasser Nu'ma, an official with the Shiite militias, formerly known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. The IS militants, he added, set an ambush by planting bombs around the tomb.

ISIS has controlled Tikrit since June, when it waged its lightning offensive that also saw Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, come under their control.

The terror group was helped in its conquest of northern Iraq by Saddam loyalists, including military veterans, who appealed to Sunnis who felt victimized by Baghdad's newly Shiite-dominated government.

ISIS claimed in August that Saddam's tomb had been completely destroyed, but local officials said that although it was ransacked and burnt, the building suffered only minor damage.

Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in 2003 and was executed by hanging in December 2006 after an Iraqi special tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity for the mass killing of Shiites and Kurds.

His body has been kept in the mausoleum in his birthplace, Ouja, since 2007.

The complex featured a marble octagon at the centre of which a bed of fresh flowers covered the place where his body was buried. The extravagant chandelier at its centre was reminiscent of the extravagant life he led until U.S. forces toppled him in 2003.

Iraqi media reported last year that the dictator's body was removed by loyalists amid fears that it would be disturbed in the fighting. Its current location is not known.

Recapturing Tikrit, a Sunni bastion on the Tigris River, would pave the way for an assault on Mosul, which U.S. officials have said could come as soon as next month.

Concerns are mounting that Iraq's Shiite militias, of which an estimated 20,000 are fighting in Tikrit, will carry out revenge attacks on this and other areas that are home to predominantly Sunni residents.

Amnesty International last year said the militias wear military uniforms but operate outside any legal framework and without any official oversight, adding that they are not prosecuted for their crimes.

Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch echoed those concerns, calling on the Iraqi government to protect civilians in Tikrit and allow them to flee combat zones. Its statement noted 'numerous atrocities' against Sunni civilians by pro-government militias and security forces.

Shiite militants are increasingly being accused of levelling the Sunni towns they capture from the Islamic State group, making it impossible for residents to return. Tikrit has already been heavily damaged in months of violence.

A satellite image of Tikrit, released last month by the United Nations, observed that at least 536 buildings in the city have been affected by the fighting, with at least 137 completely destroyed and 241 severely damaged.

Local Sunni tribal fighters have formed uneasy alliances with the Iraqi army and Shiite militias in the battle for Tikrit, which Iraqi and U.S. officials believe is essential for defeating the Sunni militant group.

Yazan al-Jubouri, a Sunni from Tikrit fighting alongside the Shiite militias, said that the Islamic State militants killed 16 of his relatives and kept his family living in horror.

'We want to take revenge on those IS militants who killed our children,' he said."

477,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,There is no mention of any specific actors or individuals responsible for the EMFs.,False,There is no mention of any purposeful or intentional actions related to the EMFs.,False,There is no mention of any threats caused by the EMFs.,False,There is no mention of any patterns connecting events or observations.,False,There is no mention of any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"An electromagnetic field (EMF) is an area of moving electrical charges. Some EMFs, especially those involving ionizing radiation, can be harmful. For most people, exposure to EMFs occurs on a daily basis, as the fields are virtually everywhere. These fields can come from natural sources, such as thunderstorms, or they may be manufactured, as are radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays, for example. According to experts, EMFs from manufactured sources, such as microwaves, do not damage human health at the level of exposure that people experience on a day-to-day basis.

What are they? EMFs exist on a spectrum, and a field’s location on the spectrum depends on its wavelength and frequency. There are two types of EMF. One has the capacity to break chemical bonds and the other does not. Fields of ionizing radiation have higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. The energy from this type of radiation can remove electrons from atoms, including those comprising water and living tissue. In the human body, high doses of ionizing radiation can prompt unstable atoms called free radicals to cause oxidative damage. Some more common sources of ionizing radiation are gamma rays, which can help treat cancer, and X-rays. Visible light exists toward the middle of the spectrum, marking the dividing line between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing EMFs have a longer wavelength and a lower frequency. They cannot break chemical bonds. Non-ionizing fields are present in many natural and manufactured forms.
• radiofrequency radiation, as in many communication devices

How do they affect our health? Ionizing radiation can be harmful because it can break chemical bonds and change the molecular and chemical structures of various substances, including human tissue. Overall, a person is more likely to experience damage if they are exposed to high levels of radiation over a longer period. This could occur, for example, if a person undergoes numerous X-rays without protection. High doses of ionizing radiation can cause immediate damage, such as: This form of radiation can also cause long-term health problems, even when a person has had no immediate symptoms. Problems that can develop over a longer period can include: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), medical applications, such as X-rays and radiation therapy, account for 98% of the population dose contribution from all manufactured sources of radiation, representing 20% of the population’s total exposure. Doctors and other healthcare providers can minimize the risk of exposure by using lead shields to protect areas of the body that are not targets for the radiation. Typical levels of exposure to non-ionizing radiation should not affect human health. In ordinary circumstances, non-ionizing radiation simply passes through the body without causing harm. Specific concerns have involved possible interference with devices such as pacemakers. However, according to the American Heart Association (AHA), pacemakers are not typically affected by radiation from household appliances, such as microwaves, computers, and Bluetooth wireless technology. Yet the AHA do recommend keeping antennae and motors roughly 6 inches away from a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Other concerns have involved cell phones as a possible cause of cancer. As the authors of a 2016 article in the Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine have noted, evidence of a connection between cell phone radiation and cancer has, so far, been weak and insubstantial. Non-ionizing radiation can create heat, as in a microwave. While this heat is not typically dangerous, in certain circumstances, it can harm human body tissue. For example, people who work in industrial or scientific settings and who are exposed to very high doses of non-ionizing radiation may be at risk of tissue damage. Certain organs are more vulnerable — the eyes and testes, for example, are more susceptible to this damage because they have a low blood supply and less capacity to regulate temperature. Overall, the risk of damage from non-ionizing radiation is low, and it only occurs after a person has been exposed to high levels of the radiation for a long time.

Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), or radiation sickness, can be severe. It usually develops after exposure to very high levels of radiation in a short period, possibly minutes. ARS is most likely to occur if radiation penetrates a person’s internal organs and a majority of their body has received some exposure. A person with ARS may experience symptoms within minutes of exposure, and the symptoms may come and go for several days. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a person may recover for a period, then feel ill again, experiencing the same symptoms or others. These can be severe, and may include:

When to see a doctor A person should seek emergency medical aid if they think that they have been exposed to high levels of radiation.
• extensive exposure to ultraviolet light, during an unusually long period in a tanning bed, for example
• an accident at or near a nuclear power plant In most cases, damage occurs after long-term exposure, such as when skin cancer develops after many years of frequent, unprotected sun exposure. People should seek medical attention if they have any symptoms of tissue damage or chronic radiation exposure, such as:
• Problems with fertility: See a doctor about multiple pregnancy losses or any difficulty conceiving.
• Unexplained pain: Consult a doctor about pain with no clear cause, especially if any internal organs seem to be involved.
• Symptoms of cancer: These include skin changes, a tumor, or changes in the way that the body functions.

Exposure to non-ionizing radiation at typical levels is not harmful. However, exposure to ionizing radiation can be a serious threat to health, if the right precautions are not in place. People should take steps to limit their exposure to ionizing EMFs, by wearing sunscreen, for example. It is important to also note that ionizing radiation, in X-rays or cancer therapy, for example, can play a crucial role in medical care."

The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Democrat Adam Schiff, is even accusing Republican Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ""secretly altering"" the memo.

Of course, it needs to be noted that Republicans and conservatives are strongly behind making the memo public while Democrats and liberals oppose it. Republicans have said the memo reveals improper use of surveillance by the FBI and the Justice Department in the Russia investigation.

But the reason why that's a good response has nothing to do with partisanship.

The best response to those who oppose this release is: ""Too bad.""

The Republican memo alleging anti-Trump bias at the FBI and U.S. Justice Department is likely to be released this week. That release will come over the strong objections of Democrats and the leadership at the FBI and Justice Department.

The debate over the memo and its importance seems like another case of partisan alternate realities.

Other liberals are insisting the memo's points aren't even that important even if they are true, because they believe the document is simply meant to distract the public from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. President Donald Trump himself has reportedly noted that the memo may do just that.

So here we go again. The debate over the memo and its importance seems like another case of partisan alternate realities. The right believes this is a crucial document the public should see. The left thinks it's likely an unimportant exaggeration or even a falsehood that will damage the Mueller investigation.

But this partisan divide over this specific memo is misleading. The truth is the American people are overwhelmingly in favor of more transparency in government, and they have been since the days of the Vietnam War.

Polls showed widespread voter dissatisfaction with the level of transparency during the Obama administration. Polls show widespread voter dissatisfaction with the level of transparency during the Trump administration. And even before Trump, a Pew Research Center poll showed that only 23 percent of Americans trust the federal government to do the right thing even most of the time.

In other words, you can't just blame President Barack Obama, you can't just blame Trump, and you can't chalk this problem up to one partisan side or the other.

The past two years of American political theater should serve as the final argument that the public wants and deserves more government transparency and more accountability from our elected and appointed officials.

So what does that mean in the current memo debate?

Obviously, the Nunes memo should be released. If Schiff says it was altered, he should release the pre-edited version to the public along with a detailed list of any specific conclusions he disagrees with and why. He and his fellow Democrats on the Intelligence Committee should obviously also release the rebuttal memo they crafted in response to the Nunes document.

If the FBI and the DOJ believe this will harm their credibility and safety, then instead of telling that to the news media they should have rushed to a federal court to make that argument and asked a judge to block the release.

If anyone really believes the memo's release will undermine the Mueller investigation, let them prove it. So far, there's no evidence anything can stop Mueller and his team even in the face of several news reports over the last several weeks about their employment records and illicit and embarrassing text messages. That cat is already out of the bag.

It shouldn't be overlooked by anyone that while this memo was still being hidden from the public and the rest of Congress, that same Congress recently passed and President Trump signed a vast expansion of spying authorities.

Would that have happened if the entire Congress and the general public had seen the memo detailing serious abuses of those powers? Considering the fact that the bill passed the Senate with no votes to spare, it's a decent bet the bill could easily have been defeated with that needed extra information in the public's rightful hands.

Now of course no one is saying the public should have access to truly sensitive government secrets and documents. But it's always essentially been the duty of our publicly accountable president and publicly elected members of congressional intelligence committees to decide when and if to release information.

That shouldn't change, but those politicians need to pick up the pace and volume of what they reveal. To say there's a backlog of data the public deserves to know is an understatement if you remember the controversy Trump ignited months ago when he promised to unmask some of the details surrounding the 54-year-old assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Secrets often have the same effect on the public as outright lies. They both hide the truth the public has a right to know. The result is that only 23 percent of the American people have any real trust in the government.

It's time to stop erring on the side of secrecy and hiding behind partisan fights as an excuse to keep the truth hidden. Releasing this intelligence memo is a first step. Hopefully much more information that will rightfully embarrass all sides in Washington will follow.

The Oklahoma State Health Department’s daily update showed Oklahoma City added 80 cases and Tulsa added 82, as the state’s total rose to 9,354. There were two additional deaths, raising the total to 366.

The figures were released not long after Gov. Kevin Stitt participated in a roundtable at the White House and told Trump that Oklahoma was “one of the first states that has safely and measurably reopened.”

“Oklahoma is ready for your visit,” the governor said. “It’s going to be safe and everyone’s really really excited.”

Trump's Tulsa rally: Health experts fear campaign rally could turn into a coronavirus 'super spreader' event

Health issues? 'Don't come!': Oklahoma GOP senator says people with health issues shouldn't attend Tulsa Trump rally

The surge in COVID-19 cases in Oklahoma is being driven largely by increases among younger people, according to state Health Department figures that show 54% of the new cases in the past two weeks were people 35 and younger.

The age group most vulnerable to serious illness and death, those 65 and older, had the smallest percentage increase in cases from June 3 to 17, according to the Health Department data.

Meanwhile, hospitalizations topped 200 for the first time since May 20, rising to 211, according to information released Thursday evening.

Though Stitt has spoken frequently about the state flattening the curve of new cases, the reopening of state businesses since late April has led to the highest daily case numbers seen in Oklahoma since the pandemic began.

New records of case numbers have been set on several recent days.

An analysis of reports from June 3 through June 17 shows 2,099 new cases in that period, with 909 of them, or 43%, in the age group of 18 to 35. Overall, cases in that age group jumped by one-third over the previous total.

There were 190 new cases in the age group 5 to 17, accounting for 9% of the increase in the past two weeks. That was a 41% jump overall from that age group’s case total prior to June 3.

Among children younger than 5, there were 47 new cases, which was an increase of 32% in that age group since June 3.

The increase for people 65 and older was 200 cases from June 3-17, which was 11% above the overall total before June 3. People 65 and over account for 80% of the COVID-19 related deaths in Oklahoma.

At a news conference on Wednesday, Stitt cited the age groups in discussing the surge in cases.

“In the last two weeks, more than half of the cases have been people under 35 ... because people are getting back out,” he said.

“Since this pandemic started, we’ve had 3,171 (cases) in that age group, with just six deaths.”

Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said Thursday on Twitter that “the recent spike in cases has not been matched with a spike in hospitalizations & deaths because the new cases were disproportionately driven by people under the age of 35. That was and is a new twist in our city’s pandemic story.”

Holt tweeted, “Case numbers matter but it also matters who is accounting for those cases and how the virus is affecting them.”

Health Department officials have said in the past week that they expected COVID-19 cases to rise as the state reopened in phases over the past several weeks. No specific outbreaks at a business or long term care facility have been cited in the recent surge; protests that followed the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer have also not been cited.

State Health Commissioner Lance Frye said Wednesday, “Once you reopen, we are expecting an increase in numbers quite frankly because as people get out and they move around more. As businesses open up, you're going to have more increased contact and you’re going to have an increase in numbers.”

The surge in cases comes as tens of thousands of people plan to gather in Tulsa this weekend for Juneteenth activities, Trump’s re-election rally and demonstrations connected to the rally.

Public health officials have cautioned that participants risk infection or spreading the disease. The Trump campaign announced that it would take temperatures at the door and distribute masks and hand sanitizer, though people won’t have to wear the masks.

The management company for the BOK Center released a statement saying that it would ""encourage all attendees to remain masked throughout the duration of the event until they exit the building. Signage reminding attendees of precautions will be placed throughout the building.""

Frye also suggested that people be tested before and after the events this weekend.

Stitt was tested for the first time Thursday before entering the White House for the roundtable. His test results were negative."
481,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions several actors, including Kelli Ward, John McCain, Jeff Flake, Kyrsten Sinema, Robert Graham, and Donald Trump.",True,"The article discusses the actions of Kelli Ward, John McCain, and other potential candidates for the Senate seat.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"PHOENIX — The upstart tea party Republican who challenged Arizona Sen. John McCain last year and then set her sights on the state's junior senator is suddenly in the national spotlight.

Former state Sen. Kelli Ward said Tuesday that Sen. Jeff Flake's decision to bow out opens a clear path for her to win his U.S. Senate seat next year. But those statements come even as Arizona Republicans are looking for other candidates to put on the ballot because they consider her unlikely to be able to knock off Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in the general election next year.

""It's not about the candidate, Kelli Ward, it's about protecting that seat and keeping it a Republican seat and keeping the seat, quite honestly, away from Kyrsten Sinema,"" said Robert Graham, the former chair of the state Republican Party who is one of a host of people considering jumping into the race. ""And I don't believe, and many people don't believe, that Kelli Ward is that person.""

Ward pushes back, saying people like Graham and the other potential candidates are establishment Republicans out of touch with the movement that elected President Donald Trump and that they don't like the independence she showed in the state Legislature.

""Some people in the establishment don't like that idea, but the voters do. And that's why I'm not only electable in a primary, I'm extremely electable in a general election,"" Ward said in an interview Tuesday. ""We're on a winning path here, and we're not going to let up.""

Ward, 48, is a West Virginia native who moved to Arizona in 1999 and worked as an emergency room physician in Lake Havasu City and nearby communities. Her husband is also an ER doctor and served in the Arizona Air National Guard.

She said she decided to run for office in 2011 after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which she calls in speeches ""an assault on health care liberty and on health care freedom."" After the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 upheld the tax credits that help lower-income people buy insurance, she compared the law on Twitter to slavery and prohibition.

She has also drawn repeated criticism for remarks she made about McCain being too old to seek re-election last year and again this year, when she suggested after his cancer diagnosis that he should step down and that the governor should consider appointing her to his seat.

Two years ago, Ward was well known only in her rural northwestern state Senate district. Her statewide exposure was limited to a few items, including an odd meeting she called in her district to let state environmental officials hear from people who thought the government was using jetliners to spray chemicals into the atmosphere for nefarious purposes. Ward has said she just facilitated the meeting and didn't believe in the ""chemtrail"" theory. But it later became an effective political attack that framed her statewide identity.

She stepped down in the middle of her second two-year term to challenge McCain, an icon in the Republican Party and former GOP presidential nominee. She turned what many saw as a laughable, upstart race into a genuine primary challenge, although in the last months McCain pulled away by using his name ID and massive fundraising prowess to handily defeat her. He then went on to win a sixth term in the Senate.

Now she is framing herself as a backer of the president, looking to drain the Washington swamp of what she calls the typical merry-go-round of recycled GOP candidates that she believes is blocking his agenda.

""The people who are stirring this up are in that swampy pot,"" she said of her GOP opponents. ""They don't want to drain the swamp.""

Besides Graham, other potential Republican candidates for Flake's seat include current state university regent Jay Heiler, state Treasurer Jeff DeWit and all five Republican members of Congress, Paul Gosar, Trent Franks, Andy Biggs, David Schweikert and Martha McSally.

It's not just Arizona Republicans who believe Ward won't make it out of the primary. Steven Law, head of a super PAC allied with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that supports GOP incumbents and establishment-aligned candidates, said Monday that Ward ""will not be the Republican nominee for this Senate seat in 2018.""

McSally's name became oft-mentioned as soon as Flake announced his retirement on Monday, because she's seen as electable as a both a moderate and a strong backer of Trump's agenda. Her southern Arizona district is one of just three in the state considered competitive. She has secured it well but is facing a challenge from former Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick next year.

Ward said she would hammer McSally in a primary race and said she needs to concentrate on winning re-election in her House district to ensure it remains in Republican hands.

""I know the Republican Party has already invested a lot of money in Martha McSally to stay in that seat and to stay strong, and I hope that she will,"" she said. ""Because there is certainly no reason for any other Republican to get into this race.""

The Republican hopefuls are waiting for the results of new polls to see who they think could beat Sinema, and Ward, who looks unmovable. Depending on the outcome, more GOP candidates could appear."
482,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions various actors, such as Ann Coulter, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Susan Sontag, Michael Moore, and Oliver Stone.",True,The article discusses the actions and statements of the mentioned actors.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"On any important issue, you can expect to hear a vigorous argument between liberals and conservatives. But when it comes to dealing with the Sept. 11 attacks, the most noteworthy debate is the one going on among people on the left and other people on the left.

In that discussion, some commentators have shown a firm grasp of reality and unapologetic patriotism. Others, however, have been striving mightily to make themselves into national laughingstocks.

There are plenty of conservatives, of course, who have used the opportunity to permanently disqualify themselves from ever being taken seriously again--including Ann Coulter, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. But for sheer volume of imbecility, it's hard to outdo the blame-America-first crowd of mindless peaceniks and twitchy conspiracy theorists. The New Republic, a moderately liberal political weekly, has been running a regular feature called ""Idiocy Watch,"" highlighting particularly lamebrained comments, and the forum has so far been dominated by lefties.

In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorism, writer Susan Sontag found herself barraged with criticism for decrying the ""self-righteous drivel and outright deception being peddled by public figures and TV commentators,"" while assailing our ""cowardly"" approach to war.

Weeks later, her bout of temporary insanity is beginning to look permanent. ""I don't like throwing biscuits and peanut butter and jam and napkins, little snack packages produced in a small city in Texas, so we can say, `Look, we're doing something humanitarian,' "" sneers Sontag in an interview with the online magazine Salon. She fears that the government is about to deport all Muslims and declare martial law, which is about as likely as Susan Sontag being appointed secretary of defense.

Humorist Michael Moore, who made the anti-capitalist movie ""Roger & Me,"" finds reasons to yuk it up. ""Finally, the bombs are raining down on Afghanistan, and as Martha Stewart says, that's a good thing,"" he brays on his Web site. ""Yesiree, I say, BOMBS AWAY! Rockets red glare. We are all WHITE WITH FOAM!"" I don't know about you, but I laughed till my ribs hurt.

Professional moviemaker and amateur paranoid Oliver Stone saw the terrorist attacks as the fault of the Republican Party. ""Does anybody make a connection between the 2000 election and the events of Sept. 11?"" he asked at a recent panel discussion in New York, which I take to mean that the terrorists were bitter that Al Gore didn't win.

Stone searched hard and found something good to say about Osama bin Laden and Co.: ""The new world order is about order and control. This attack was pure chaos, and chaos is energy. All great changes have come from people or events that were initially misunderstood, and seemed frightening, like madmen.""

Does it seem odd to you that Oliver Stone would feel affinity with madmen? Me neither.

Fortunately, you can find plenty of left-of-center commentators who prefer their country and its ideals over those of the enemy. At the New York forum, writer Christopher Hitchens lambasted Stone as a ""moral idiot, as well as an intellectual idiot."" The attack, he said, was ""state-supported mass murder, using civilians as missiles.""

The Nation magazine, perhaps the best-known organ of leftist thought, published a column by Katha Pollitt on why she refused to let her daughter decorate their living-room window with an American flag--which Mom regards as a symbol of ""jingoism and vengeance and war."" (The daughter retorts that the flag ""means standing together and honoring the dead and saying no to terrorism."" Where does she get such ideas?)

But many other Nation contributors have taken a sharply different view from Pollitt's. Writing in the latest issue, Princeton professor Richard Falk agrees with those who fault the U.S. as an imperialist power, but says that critique is ""dangerously inappropriate in addressing the challenge posed by the massive crime against humanity committed on Sept. 11."" The American role in world affairs, he argues, ""cannot be addressed so long as this movement of global terrorism is at large and prepared to carry on with its demonic work.""

Nation columnist Eric Alterman has no charity toward those who feel no patriotism at a time like this. Some of them, he says, ""really do hate their country. These leftists find nothing to admire in its magnificent Constitution; its fitful history of struggle toward greater freedom for women, minorities and other historically oppressed groups; and its values, however imperfectly or hypocritically manifested in everyday life."" For Alterman, ""patriotism requires no apologies.""

Those who feel differently--who can't take their own country's side when it is under attack by murderous foreign theocrats--should find themselves disgraced and ignored long after this struggle is over. In wartime, as leftists like Alterman understand, stupidity is not forgivable."

Alabama's order will go into effect Saturday at 5:00 p.m. and is set to expire April 30 at 5:00 p.m.

""We've got to take this order dead serious; otherwise, the fact is more people will end up dying,"" Ivey said in a tweet Friday.

Residents will still be allowed to leave their homes for food and medicine, as well as for other essential reasons. They will also be able to attend religious services that are limited to fewer than 10 people and have worshipers stand at least six feet apart, according to the order.

Alabama currently has 1,454 confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Alabama joins the majority of states — including New York, New Jersey, California and Washington — in mandating people to stay at home as a measure to keep the virus from spreading.

Concerts are still banned under social distancing measures in Israel, with the country recordinf at least 279 deaths from coronavirus. Contained protests, however, are still permitted.

Organisers billed the new event as ‘Behind The Scenes: An Assembly Of Solidarity’, which included performances by Israeli acts including Aviv Geffen and Rita.

The protest was arranged to raise funds for those working in live events whose sole income depends on them. It was staged to encourage the Israeli government to restart live programming.

As Billboard reports, the demo had the backing of the Israeli Police and the city of Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai was in attendance and said on stage that the virus “has left many singers, actors and backstage workers with no income and uncertainty about when they’ll be able to earn a living again.”

Attendees were allowed to enter Charles Clore public park, where the concert was held, if they were wearing face masks. They were obligated to keep six feet apart. As Billboard reports further: “Most people appeared initially to spread out throughout the park lawns but soon drew closer to the stage and did not obey health regulations, according to video of the event and two people who attended. Hundreds of people did not wear masks and stood side by side.”

The promoters paid all staff members involved, while the artists – which also included veteran rocker Shalom Hanoch – said they would waive fees.

Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recently that lockdown restrictions might be completely removed by mid-June [via JPost].

The Tel Aviv concert was one of the first large-scale music gatherings since lockdown was enforced in March."

The statistical chance of being killed by terrorism in the United States in 2001 was significantly lower than dying as a result of a motor vehicle accident.

Fresh from dumping two dead bodies in a river, Pat sets his eyes on another enemy in tonight's double-bill.

The scheming builder tried to make Seb think that Anna Windass had deliberately tried to kill him by causing his ladder to collapse.

With Seb unconscious in the hospital, Phelan dripped poison in his ear and whispered his shocking lies to try and get Anna done for murder.

The soap villain, who forced Andy Carver to kill Vinny Ashford before turning the gun on his prisoner, came to Seb's bedside to carry out his next twisted move.

Leaning in towards Seb, he muttered: ""Anna Windass hates you, she wants you dead. You hear me. Anna Windass wants you dead. She pushed you off that ladder.""

Pheland proved to have amazing powers of persuasion, as his Jedi mind trick really did convince Seb that it was Anna that pushed him off the ladder.

Once Seb woke up, he revealed to Faye that Anna was the one that caused him to fall.

Seb said: ""Anna wants me dead. She pushed me off that a ladder.""

Viewers know that this is not the case as Anna was walking out of the cafe at the time.

However, Faye phoned the police and grassed her own mum up.

Corrie viewers took to Twitter after seeing Pat's amazing powers of persuasion.

The U.N. health agency reported that two children were infected by the highly infectious, water-borne disease and that one was paralyzed. The outbreak was sparked by a mutated virus that originated in the vaccine and was not connected to a previous polio epidemic Niger stopped last year, WHO said, in a statement last week.

“The poliovirus will inevitably continue to circulate and may paralyze more children as no high-quality immunization campaigns can be conducted in a timely manner,” said Pascal Mkanda, WHO’s coordinator of polio eradication in Africa.

In rare cases, the live virus in oral polio vaccine can evolve into a form capable of igniting new outbreaks among non-immunized children; stopping the epidemic requires more targeted vaccination.

Earlier this month, WHO and partners announced they were forced to halt all polio vaccination activities until at least June 1, acknowledging the decision would inevitably result in more children being paralyzed.

The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there have been 33,500 cases and 1,469 deaths as of Tuesday, but experts suspect the real numbers are far higher due to lack of testing and poor surveillance.

Eradicating polio requires more than 90% of children being immunized, typically in mass campaigns involving millions of health workers that would break social distancing guidelines needed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.

Across Africa, 14 other countries are struggling to contain their polio epidemics, which have also been caused by a rare mutation of the virus in the oral vaccine. Health officials had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, but that deadline has been pushed back and missed repeatedly."

The former President also warned that Russia’s Vladimir Putin “is zero-sum. He can’t think, ‘How can we both win?’ He only thinks, ‘How do I win, you lose?’”

Russia has denied trying to influence the November 2016 vote but US intelligence agencies concluded it had.

Mr Trump has previously downplayed the findings but last year said he was “with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with the leadership”.

Mr Bush said it was not clear if Russia’s “meddling” directly affected the election, though he said it was clear they tried and that it was “dangerous for democracy”.

“It’s problematic that a foreign nation is involved in our election,” he added at a conference in Abu Dhabi, and continued: “Putin is a brilliant tactician who has the capacity to detect weakness and exploit it.

“He’s got a chip on his shoulder. The reason he does is because the demise of the Soviet Union troubles him. Therefore, much of his moves [are] to regain Soviet hegemony.”

The Republican leader, who occupied the Oval Office from 2001 to 2009, said Mr Putin “is pushing, constantly pushing, probing weaknesses. That’s why Nato is very important.”

Former FBI director Robert Mueller is currently investigating alleged links between the Kremlin and Mr Trump’s campaign team.

Several people including the Republican’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, have been charged.

Mr Trump denies any such links, and has called the investigation a “witch hunt” perpetrated by his political opponents.

The 43rd US President has intervened a number of times to apparently rebuke Mr Trump during the latter’s time in office.

In a book he said “this guy doesn’t know what it means to be President”, and last October, while not mentioning his fellow Republican by name, he said that in recent times “bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication”.

Mr Bush broke a longstanding silence in February last year to say that a free press was “indispensable to democracy”, after Mr Trump attacked a number of media companies as “enemies of the people”.

“Power can be very addictive, and it can be corrosive, and it’s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power, whether it be here or elsewhere”, he added.

At the Abu Dhabi event Mr Bush also said it was important to recognise that the United States had a history of welcoming people regardless of their religion or where they were born, in an apparent criticism of Mr Trump’s policies.

“Our system is broken but we’ve got to fix it. I had tried, but unsuccessfully,” he said without naming Mr Trump. “It is important for our economy and also important for our soul that the immigration system functions well.”"

The connection was originally claimed by former gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield in the 1998, who has since been barred from practising medicine.

The research, which was funded by Novo Nordisk Foundation and the Danish Ministry of Health, studied 657,461 children born between 1999 and 2001 in Denmark and followed them from the age of one to August 2013, which represented more than five million follow-up years.

Population registries were used to link information on MMR vaccination to autism diagnoses, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism and autism risk factors.

The Annals of Internal Medicine-published study found that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk of autism in general, does not trigger autism in susceptible, such as those with autistic siblings, and is not associated with a clustering of autism cases.



This study builds on research carried out by the same researchers in 2002 on 537,303 Danish children.

In the past year, there has been a significant rise in measles cases globally. This is primarily due to the rise in ‘fake news’, which has reinvigorated so-called anti-vaxxers.

A recent UNICEF report found that 98 countries reported more measles cases in 2018 than in 2017 and eight countries with notable numbers of measles cases had no reported cases in 2017. This was attributed to “poor health infrastructure, civil strife, low community awareness, complacency and vaccine hesitancy.”

NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens at the think tank Nuffield Trust’s Health Policy Summit 2019 on 1 March said: “Across the world two to three million lives are saved each year by vaccination, but as part of the fake news movement, actually the vaccination denies are getting some traction.

“Last year, for example, we saw triple the number of measles cases across the England than we saw the year before. We have seen a five year steady decline in vaccination uptake, and the consequence of this is these are very effective health interventions that we have to continue to win the public argument about.

“We are not being helped on this front by the fact that although nine in ten parents say they support vaccination, half of them saw they have seen fake messages around vaccination on social media.”

The Royal Society of Public Health recently conducted a report, called ‘Moving the Needle’, which linked fear and misinformation, primarily disseminated online through social media and patient forums, to negative public attitudes towards vaccination, which can damage stable vaccination programmes.

The anti-vaccination circumstances has led the World Health Organization to declare vaccine hesitancy as one of its top ten threats to global health in 2019."

Worse, if you don’t like the term “brainwashing,” then what will you call the violent conversion therapy currently practiced on hundreds of thousands of concentration camp detainees in Xinjiang?

Even if Mitchell is right that “the term is used frequently by ideologues of all stripes to define the opinions of those whom they disagree with as the result of external mind control rather than an independent thought process,” how is it remotely possible to even write on this topic without touching on the massive campaign forcing people at gunpoint, in the Xinjiang camps, to regurgitate CCP dogma and then denounce themselves and deny their identity day out and day in — as copiously documented by numerous witnesses — surely a full-throated contemporary revival of Maoist CCP torture-brainwashing?

The idea of “an independent thought process” as an alternate explanation for why people change their mind, whatever its usefulness elsewhere, cannot be a suitable framework for understanding the fate of Chinese dissenters paraded on TV when their CCP torturers have tormented them enough to be satisfied with their parroting performance, — or, worse, for understanding the fate of the thousands of people now being reduced to broken zombies in the Xinjiang camps.

I would have thought that it should be impossible for any scholar free to speak their mind, to touch on this topic of brainwashing today without touching on these dramatic current developments so obviously rooted in the undeniable – whatever you want to call it.

This article, in purposefully omitting what is happening today, and refusing to touch on how the massive crimes of today are so obviously built on the past torture practices under Mao, refashioned to target dissenters and ethnic minorities today – in effect sidelining such questions by suggesting it is all somehow about cold war residues – to me comes across as intellectually dishonest.

Sorry if I am blunt here, but we live today, and we must face the horrors of today, not hide from them – or hide them under a “Cold War” carpet."

The US is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in Somalia, or any other country for that matter, that is harboring terrorists. These people are responsible for killing American citizens, as well as many other people from all over the world. We cannot let these people get away with these crimes. The entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists, Europe included. If the world does not stand up now, we will have a much, much bigger problem in the years to come. No one stood up to Hitler until it was too late, we can't afford to do the same thing again. - Richard Mattis

The US gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism. Terrorists are killing defenseless men, women, children and our freedom. How do you bring terrorists in for peace talks? Let history speak for itself. Europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns, killing civilians indiscriminately.

My friends in Germany, wake up and smell the jihad. Just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country, reeling from a century of warfare, and understandably wishing for peace in this world, being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat. These are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the Middle East, Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, England, Spain, Thailand, and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet. Eradicating these people, especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders, as was done in Somalia just now, is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace. Somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical Islamic threat. Only a fool loves war, but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him. Godspeed to the Ethiopian army. More civilized nations, especially the ""blind mice"" of Europe, had better come on board before it's too late. Germany: you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason. - Ron Jendry

I believe it was the Islamist and warlords that destabilized Somalia, not the USA, which killed a known terrorist, one that could have easily struck any of the EU embassies or nations.

The dilemmas around how to define deceptive speech and how to check rank duplicity bedevil every modern capitalist society.

Past efforts suggest both key actions to consider and some cautions about how hard the task will be.

The most effective approach depends on a combination of meaningful self-regulation by the business community, innovative fraud policing and the willingness of political leaders and media elites to stand up for truthful public communication. At the moment, perhaps because of the extent to which Americans have come to disagree about what counts as “truth,” each of these requirements seems in short supply.

Anti-fraud efforts have an especially rich history in the United States, connecting such disparate topics as adulterated fertilizers, bogus patent medicines, and fly-by-night mail order firms, endemic investment swindles and bait-and-switch consumer advertising, and, more recently, telemarketing scams and misleading sales pitches for debt products like residential mortgages.

Every generation, Americans relearn that deceptive business practices not only harm investors and consumers, but also hurt honest firms and undermine broader economic confidence. What then to do about it?

One recurring impulse has been to deny the worst liars access to the marketplace. After the Civil War, the American Post Office Department invented the fraud order, which tackled the problem of deceptive long-distance marketing by denying allegedly duplicitous firms access to the mails. In the early 20th century, the new network of Better Business Bureaus began to circulate suggestions to newspapers and magazines that ads from especially dodgy marketers were “not in the public interest.” More recently, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have collaborated on Operation Chokepoint, which has denied sellers of bogus goods and services access to the online payment system.

The problem of fake news has prompted analogous countermeasures, this time implemented by social media companies like Facebook FB, and Google GOOG, GOOGL, . These companies have banned the producers of phony news accounts from using their online advertising services.

Efforts to cast out commercial fabricators from the marketplace have the big advantage of immediate, quick impact. But America’s history of anti-fraud regulation suggests important limitations as well. There is the whack-a-mole problem, since cheats and deceivers often respond to fraud orders and similar tactics by relaunching businesses under different names.

Such summary modes of dispensing justice also clash with American commitments to the rule of law, and so prompt complaints about exercises of raw power that seem more consistent with autocratic regimes. Faced with such critiques, most anti-fraud agencies eventually create procedural protections against unfair treatment: notice of impending bans from access to the marketplace, access to incriminating evidence and an opportunity to mount a defense through formal hearings.

The resulting reforms (in the 1910s and 1920s for mail fraud orders, in the 1950s and 1960s for Better Business Bureau recommendations that media outlets shun specific advertisers) made anti-fraud enforcement fairer. But they did so at the cost of slowing down enforcement actions and diminishing their effects.

The history of American anti-fraud policing suggests there is no magic bullet to the endemic problem of deception in the marketplace or the public square. Criminal prosecutions of the worst offenders can make a difference, though constitutional protections for free speech and the global reach of the internet complicate this potential means of curbing fake news.

Well-conceived public education may be even more important, whether undertaken by government agencies, NGOs or the media. Another emerging strategy to curb bogus news emphasizes this approach. The idea is to rely on crowdsourced tagging on social media of stories as “disputed,” along with work by journalistic gatekeepers to adjudicate such allegations.

Read:The next conversation about fake news needs to be this one

As this example suggests, we will never escape the need to invest trusted arbiters with the authority to label some deceptive practices as illicit. And unless we are willing to tolerate draconian regulatory actions, we will never banish duplicity entirely from our economic or political life.

Our best option is to tailor laws and design institutions with the goal of containing fakery and fraud, an objective that depends as much on the operation of social norms and shaming techniques as it does on formal penalties and the cultivation of savvier consumers of products, investment pitches and news.

This approach is far from perfect. But it can limit the impact of deceitful speech, and so the corrosive threats to our economy and our democracy.

It also said: ""Most experts now agree that the large rise (in autism) has been caused partly by increased diagnosis, but also by a real increase in the number of children with autism.""

A further claim said the vaccine-strain measles virus has been found in the gut and brain of some autistic children, which supports many parents' belief that the MMR vaccine caused autism in their children.

Defending the claims, Babyjabs referred to one study in particular from 2002, which it considered to be one of the strongest pieces of evidence that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism but which it claimed includes the lead author's conclusion: ""We cannot rule out the existence of a susceptible subgroup with an increased risk of autism if vaccinated.""

It also said The Truth About Vaccines, a book written by Babyjabs medical director Dr Richard Halvorsen, stated: ""If one in 800 MMR vaccinations triggered an autistic disorder, this would result in around 1,200 children a year in the UK being made autistic by the bundling of the vaccines. This is probably the worst case scenario.""

Dr Halvorsen added that ""research, including large population studies, has since shown that the MMR is not causing the large majority of autism, but has been unable to exclude the possibility that it is causing autism in a small number of susceptible children"".

Upholding the complaint, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) noted that the website makes clear that the original allegations of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism by Andrew Wakefield was ""strongly rejected"" by government and the medical establishment"".

But it said consumers are likely to infer from the website's claims that the vaccine might have played a role in the ""increase"" in the number of children with autism.

The ASA said: ""We understood that the position held by the World Health Organisation and the Department of Health was that no evidence existed of a causal association between the MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders, and that the Cochrane review, looking at the general evidence available, could find no significant association between MMR immunisation and autism.

""We noted that the evidence provided by the advertiser included studies and an article which looked at the increased prevalence of autism, but did not include evidence that any increase was due to the MMR vaccine.""

It ruled that the claims must not appear again in their current form."

Throughout February, deaths overall in England and Wales were below the five-year rolling average compiled by the ONS.

But figures released this morning show a huge spike in deaths where Covid-19 was not mentioned on the death certificate in the week ending April 3.

The ONS figures show that two weeks ago England and Wales recorded 16,387 deaths, which is 6,089 more than the week average.

This means that 869 more people died per day than during an average week.

More than a third of those deaths was not caused by Covid-19, according to the death certificates.

A spokesman for the ONS said they couldn't speculate on the spike but said that later this week they will be publishing a more in-depth look at the deaths registered in March.

Similar spikes in overall deaths have been reported in Spain, Italy and France as European countries grappling with the pandemic struggle with how to tabulate exactly how many people are being killed by the virus directly or indirectly.

Most experts agree the current figures are likely to be lower than reality, with them not including, for example, people who died before they could be tested or people who were unable to be treated at hospitals because of the pandemic.

In Spain a study by the government’s health research centre showed that “excess” deaths in the Castile-La Mancha region were double the number attributed to Covid-19, a situation very similar to what is being reported by the ONS in the UK.

In Italy, L’Eco di Bergamo, a newspaper, obtained data from 82 localities in Italy’s Bergamo province.

In March these places had 2,420 more deaths than in March 2019. But 1,140, less than half of the increase, were attributed to Covid-19, reports The Economist.

Earlier this month the New York Times reported how hospitals were 'eerily quiet' apart from coronavirus cases with a fall in reported strokes and heart attacks despite there being no medical reason.

In some hospitals there has been a 60% reduction in reported admissions for heart attacks.

This is despite respiratory infections such as Covid-19 typically increase the risk of heart attacks.

The UK government is preparing to launch a campaign to encourage those seriously ill to still go to hospital.

Attendances to emergency departments were 1.53m in March, down 22% from February.

It is the lowest number since NHS England began recording comparable data in 2010.

The health service said it was likely to be a result of the Covid-19 response.

A separate dataset from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, released on April 3, which collects figures from 50 NHS trusts in England, shows emergency attendances had fallen to 58,447 – down from 73,801 the previous week.

“We are concerned that this drop in attendance may mean that people with serious health problems are avoiding going to their emergency department for fear of getting coronavirus,” said the college’s president, Dr Katherine Henderson.

She added: “While this is the lowest number of attendances since 2010, it is the highest-ever level of admissions as a proportion of attendances – this of course reflects the high acuity of patients presenting with Covid-19 problems, but in fact is something that has been increasing for some time.

""Even before Covid-19, we knew that patients were getting sicker – people are living longer and acquiring more health problems.”

David Davis, a spokesman for the College of Paramedics said: “The NHS is still open for business, thanks to the sacrifice that everyone is making by staying at home.

“It’s really important that members of the public who are suffering with life-threatening emergencies like stroke, heart attack, severe bleeding or breathing difficulties still call 999."""

Mr. Denny also said that the figure of 150 used in the hearing two weeks ago had probably come from his estimate. He said that for seven years his office had processed the papers from other counties for assignment of 20 to 22 foster‐home children a year into People's Temple homes in the Ukiah area and that his estimate, which he now sees as too high, had been based on this recollection.

Mr. Denny would not say which California counties had sent the children to the homes of People's Temple members. Neither would investigators for the General Accounting Office.

“We're going through this matching exercise trying to identify foster children,” said Richard Newman, a supervisor in the G.A.O. headquarters in Washington. The work here is being done by Joe Gordon, supervisory auditor and investigator for the Congressional watchdog agency. It was Mr. Gordon who served the subpoena on the California Department of Social Services. Mr. Newman said that the state agency had insisted on having the records subpoenaed because of statutory guarantees of privacy involving welfare payments.

Two lists of names of possible Jonestown victims are available to investigators. One is that prepared by the United States State Department of bodies for which identities were established. There are about 625 names.

The other list was compiled by People's Temple members who were living in the cult's headquarters here and were not in Jonestown on the day of the mass suicide. This list is of the members who went to Jonestown; it contains about 960 names and includes the handful who were in Guyana but survived either because they hid or because they were in Georgetown that day.

Sean Ortiz, a public information officer for the California Department of Social Services, said that state files were being checked back 18 months before the date of the mass deaths. He said that 142 “matches” had been found last month between the death list and the names of persons paid under the Federal Supplemental Security Incomeprogram, which aids the blind, aged and disabled."
497,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions the British man who has been harboring mutated poliovirus in his guts and shedding them in his feces. He is described as an 'obvious risk to the eradication program.',True,"The article discusses the actions of the British man who has been shedding mutated poliovirus in his feces, as well as the actions of the researchers who have been studying him.",True,The article mentions that the British man and other long-term shedders of poliovirus are a risk to the eradication program. The continuous shedding of live virus could potentially sicken unvaccinated individuals or those with compromised immune systems.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections between events or observations.,False,The article does not discuss any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"At the end of the decades-long global battle to eradicate polio from the planet, there is what looks like a simple goal: Render every person immune, by vaccination, for long enough that the disease can find no host in which to breed, and thus dies out. That was the strategy behind the eradication of smallpox, and since polio like smallpox affects only humans, it is supposed to work for that disease too.

Of course, it’s a little more complicated, and a paper published last week reveals one of the most challenging complications. It describes a British man of about 30 who, as a toddler, was given the full course of polio vaccines in use at the time—and who, for 28 years, has been harboring mutated, virulent poliovirus in his guts and shedding them in his feces. The researchers who wrote about him call him, and other patients like him, “an obvious risk to the eradication program.”

Long-term shedders of poliovirus have been identified before. It’s a rare phenomenon, and for it to occur, several things have to happen: Someone has to be vaccinated as an infant with the oral polio vaccine, which contains a weakened live virus; has to have an immune-system deficiency that keeps the body from eliminating the vaccine virus after immunity develops; and, usually, has to live in an industrialized country where medical care is good enough to keep children with immune-system deficiencies alive.

That has happened a number of times—more than 70—since polio vaccination began in the 1950s, but only a few people shed virus long enough to make public health planners concerned. This man is the longest-duration shedder known, but he may not be the only one. Sampling programs that look for live poliovirus in sewage have identified mutated vaccine viruses in Finland, Israel and eastern Europe, indicating other, unidentified shedders may be out there too.

A little refresher on polio vaccines: There are two, the original injectable that uses killed virus (Jonas Salk’s original vaccine) and the oral drop version that contains a weakened live virus (Albert Sabin’s formula). The oral vaccine was the first one used in the international eradication campaign, because it is inexpensive to make and can be administered by anyone. It is still used in the developing world, though industrialized countries have gone back to the original injectable.

For all its benefits, the oral version has a known issue, a combination of bug and feature. Once it is given, the vaccine virus replicates in the gut. The feature part is that, when the vaccine virus passes out of the body, it can spread through the environment of places with poor sanitation, conferring a kind of passive secondary immunization on others nearby. The bug part is that, in the few weeks it is replicating, the vaccine virus mutates, and sometimes mutates back past the artificial weakening to the original disease-causing form.

If that reversion happens to someone who lives in an area where vaccination has been patchy, an outbreak of “vaccine-derived” polio can spark—and has, dozens of times since the campaign began. It’s happening right now in Ukraine, in fact, and the World Health Organization is negotiating with the country to begin vaccinations. (There’s an update on the index page of the eradication campaign’s site, but frustratingly it’s part of a slideshow with no static link.)

But those outbreaks have always been easy to detect, and quenched by improved vaccination. However, if the reversion happens in someone who also has an immune disorder, that person becomes a source of infectious virus that mutates continually not for weeks, but for years. And because the person is probably surrounded by other vaccinated individuals, there is no obvious outbreak to help pinpoint the problem—just a slow leak of live virus that could sicken an unvaccinated infant, a vaccine refuser, or a vulnerable immune-compromised adult somewhere else.

The British man’s problem has been known since he was a child—he was first tested in 1995, when one of this paper’s authors was studying the immune condition he suffers from—and numerous attempts have been made to chase polio from his system. None have worked. Extensive analysis of the virus he carries shows that it is virulent, paralyzing lab mice; but also that the vaccines currently in use protect against it.

However. Poliovirus comes in three flavors, strains known for simplicity as type 1, 2 and 3. The vaccines used so far in the campaign have included all three strains, but there are plans to reduce the formula to types 1 and 3 because type 2 has disappeared from the wild. The British man’s strain, however, is type 2, preserved in his system even as it was forced into extinction elsewhere. Could he, or an unlucky person like him, re-ignite an epidemic?

If the world switched from the oral vaccine to the injectable, which the international eradication campaign is planning for, the risk of random outbreaks from mutated virus would go away. The risk of existing shedders continuing to pump out virus would not—not unless vaccination continued indefinitely. The entire goal of the campaign, though, is to vaccinate the world until polio is eradicated, and then stop.

Despite years of fretting, no one has yet proposed a solution to the problem of shedders that accounts for all the complexities: the difficulty of finding them, the necessity of respecting their rights if found, the huge sunk cost of polio eradication that makes it hard to change course, and the difficult sell of achieving novel vaccines that could solve the problem but would be useful only a few years afterward. The authors who wrote up the man’s plight, though, warn that it is definitely time to begin strategizing. “[Vaccine-derived polio] from these patients,” they say, “represent a real risk of polio re-emergence in the post-eradication era.”"

The residents affected by the illness — a 62-year-old woman and a 75-year-old male patient — lived on separate floors of Hong Mei House, sparking fears that the virus could be transmitted through drainage pipes.

Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said they were investigating whether or not the two cases were linked and urged residents to clean and disinfect pipes and putting down the toilet lid before flushing.

Hong Kong is still reeling from memories of the SARS outbreak in 2003 which killed over 100 people in the region.

More than 300 of the cases of SARS in Hong Kong had been linked to a large apartment complex in which the virus spread through the sewage system and environmental contamination, a Hong Kong government investigation found.

On expert recommendation, the government quarantined residents living in all units numbered 07 on 30 separate floors. About 100 residents from those households were being transferred to quarantine centres from the residence located in the northwest of the city, the Centre for Health Protection said.

In the apartment where the 62-year-old woman was living, ""the vent pipe at the toilet which was altered without permission has been sealed up,"" authorities said.

""The public is strongly urged to maintain at all times strict personal and environmental hygiene which is key to personal protection against infection and prevention of the spread of the disease in the community,"" a spokesperson for the health department said.

The novel coronavirus — officially called COVID-19 — was first reported in late December in Wuhan, China. There are currently 50 cases of the virus in Hong Kong and people arriving from mainland China are required to undergo quarantine for 14 days."

From today, public authorities including schools, prisons and NHS trusts will have a legal duty to prevent extremist radicalisation taking place within their walls. Well in these confused times we're all bewildered in knowing how best to tackle extremism, whether religious or ideological.

Some years ago I attended an inter-faith occasion where ministers from various world faiths read in turn some verses which each had chosen from their sacred scriptures. An Iman, a Hindu priest and the vicar who was hosting the occasion each read some uplifting verses. So far so good.

Then the vicar explained that, sadly, the Jewish rabbi who'd wanted to be with us was ill, but that he'd sent his chosen verses to be read out. They were from Psalm 137 ""You devastator! Happy shall they be who pay you back what you have done to us! Happy shall they be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock!"" There was a stunned silence.

A couple of weeks later I met the rabbi at another gathering and asked him, ""why ever did you choose that lamentable psalm when there are so many inspiring verses in the Hebrew scriptures which you could have chosen? "" ""That's the point"", he said, ""All world faiths have irenic passages in their scriptures, but the truth is that all our scriptures also have difficult, or even scandalous passages, and we won't make real progress in inter-faith relationships until we have the courage to discuss those with one another.""

As a Christian, it made me think of the leader of the Jonestown community, who, before they committed mass suicide, was fond of quoting to the Christian followers of his extremist sect the words from St Luke's gospel, ""Whoever does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters cannot be my disciple"".

It's commonly said that people committing atrocities are not real members of the faith that they're dying for or killing for. But that is certainly not their own understanding; they're feeding on certain verses in their sacred scriptures or events in their faith history which encourage them to act in extreme or even violent ways. Well the truth is that any world faith doesn’t have a single colour to its understanding of God and the world, it’s a spectrum of colours. That's why it's difficult to put our finger on what is real Christianity, or real Islam, or real Judaism, or even real Britishness. The religious or political extremist focuses on just one of the colours and pushes it to excess or even destruction.

To combat extremism we need to encourage one another to be open to the total breadth of our faith inheritance, however uncomfortable that may be. By having an honest conversation about the difficult parts of scripture within our faith communities, those people who use them to justify violence today might find it harder to hide behind them tomorrow."
500,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions German intelligence agents and the US authorities.,True,The article discusses the actions of German intelligence agents obtaining a copy of a plan and passing it on to the US.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,True,The article mentions a secret military study and doubts about its authenticity.,"This week The New York Times reported that German intelligence agents had obtained a copy of the plan and passed it on to the US weeks before the invasion.

The report, which Germany has vehemently denied, has triggered huge controversy and calls for a parliamentary inquiry.

On Friday, Germany still stuck to its denial but a government spokesman said Berlin had asked Washington for more details about the affair. The German government is hoping in particularly that the US can shed light on the classified military study on which the Times report was based and whether it included a sketch map that was printed by the paper.

""We have renewed our request to the American side and expressed the wish: if you can, give us the information whether such a secret study exists, is there a study with sketches, where do you believe such a sketch came from?"" Steg said.

He added that German authorities were currently in contact with several US officials to find out what the ""alleged secret military study"" was all about.

Steg, much like Germany's intelligence service (BND), reiterated that there was no direct contact between its agents in Baghdad and US authorities.

Germany, under former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, vocally opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq. But a series of revelations in recent weeks has raised uncomfortable questions about its exact role in the war.

A classified report by the German parliament, the Bundestag, parts of which were released to the public, underlined that German intelligence agents in Iraq mainly supplied information on civilian sites that the Americans should avoid bombing.

Berlin has also admitted that its spies provided descriptions of the Iraqi military and police presence in Baghdad, but has strongly rejected allegations that the information was used to select bombing targets.

On Friday Steg stressed that the German government wasn't aware of the secret Saddam Hussein defense plan and thus couldn't have passed it to Washington.

""You can't pass on something that you don't know,"" Steg said.

Steg also raised doubts over the authenticity of the diagram printed in The New York Times.

""I don't honestly know if a city of many millions of people like Baghdad could develop a defense concept on the basis of such a sketch,"" he said. ""I have the greatest doubts.""

The report is expected to be discussed at a meeting next Monday of the German parliamentary committee in charge of monitoring the secret services.

The outcome of the meeting will decide the fate of a parliamentary probe that the opposition Greens and Left Party are pushing for. The free-market liberals (FDP), the largest opposition party, have said they'll make up their minds after the meeting of the parliamentary committee."

This week, drawing on 403 pages of leaked government documents, The New York Times published new details of how the ongoing crackdown took shape under Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leadership in the Communist Party of China, how government workers who resisted the plan were sidelined, and what officials were instructed to tell young people whose families had been detained.

“They’re in a training school set up by the government to undergo collective systematic training, study and instruction,” the talking points read, adding, “You have nothing to worry about.”

The Chinese government’s campaign against those it says have been exposed to extremism is centered on an autonomous region, Xinjiang, where nearly half of the 25 million residents are a Muslim people called the Uighurs.

Earlier in November, a FRONTLINE documentary called In the Age of AI examined how, as part of its crackdown involving the Uighurs, China’s government has made Xinjiang a test project for forms of extreme digital surveillance.

Among those efforts, the film reported, is an artificial intelligence system that the government claims can predict individuals prone to “terrorism” and detect those in need of “reeducation” at scores of recently built camps.

“The kinds of behavior that’s now being monitored — you know, which language do you speak at home, whether you’re talking to your relatives in other countries, how often you pray — that information is now being Hoovered up and used to decide whether people should be subjected to political reeducation in these camps,” Sophie Richardson, China Director for Human Rights Watch, tells FRONTLINE in the below excerpt from the documentary:

Surveillance and artificial intelligence technologies are being deployed all throughout China. Cameras with AI-powered facial recognition are everywhere, and various pilot projects use AI to give people a “social credit” score, punishing some for certain behavior and rewarding others for what the government considers good citizenship.

But the ends to which this technology is being used on the Uighur population, activists in the film say, are particularly alarming.

“They have bar codes in somebody’s home doors to identify what kind of citizen that he is,” lawyer and a prominent Uighur activist Nury Turkel says, warning that China’s government is using new technologies to help carry out mass punishment of an ethnic group.

Though China’s government says conditions inside its “re-education camps” are very good, as the film says, there have been reports of torture and deaths inside them.

The documents published in part by The New York Times this week were leaked, the Times said, by “a member of the Chinese political establishment” who hoped to help hold party leadership accountable for detaining Muslim citizens en masse.

Following the publication of the Times’ story, a Chinese government spokesman defended what he called “a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures” that he said had been successful in preventing violent terror attacks in Xinjiang. The Xinjiang regional government responded more forcefully, describing the Times reporting as “total nonsense and a pack of lies.” Chinese officials have not disputed the authenticity of the leaked documents.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

YouTube has announced that it will no longer recommend videos that ""come close to"" violating its community guidelines, such as conspiracy or medically inaccurate videos.

On Saturday, a former engineer for Google, YouTube's parent company, hailed the move as a ""historic victory.""

The original blog post from YouTube, published on Jan. 25, said that videos the site recommends, usually after a user has viewed one video, would no longer lead just to similar videos and instead would ""pull in recommendations from a wider set of topics.""

For example, if one person watches one video showing the recipe for snickerdoodles, they may be bombarded with suggestions for other cookie recipe videos. Up until the change, the same scenario would apply to conspiracy videos.

YouTube said in the post that the action is meant to ""reduce the spread of content that comes close to — but doesn’t quite cross the line of — violating"" its community policies. The examples the company cited include ""promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.""

The change will not affect the videos' availability. And if users are subscribed to a channel that, for instance, produces conspiracy content, or if they search for it, they will still see related recommendations, the company wrote.

Guillaume Chaslot, a former Google engineer, said that he helped to build the artificial intelligence used to curate recommended videos. In a thread of tweets posted on Saturday, he praised the change.

""It's only the beginning of a more humane technology. Technology that empowers all of us, instead of deceiving the most vulnerable,"" Chaslot wrote.

Chaslot described how, prior to the change, a user watching conspiracy theory videos was led down a rabbit hole of similar content, which was the intention of the AI he said he helped build.

According to Chaslot, the goal of YouTube's AI was to keep users on the site as long as possible in order to promote more advertisements. When a user was enticed by multiple conspiracy videos, the AI not only became biased by the content the hyper-engaged users were watching, it also kept track of the content that those users were engaging with in an attempt to reproduce that pattern with other users, Chaslot explained.

He pointed to a different artificial intelligence that was also shaped by the bias of its users: Microsoft's chatbot ""Tay.""

Tay was a Twitter chatbot produced by Microsoft, which was meant to interact with users like a human and learn from others.

Within 24 hours of its release, Tay went from innocent chatbot to full-blown misogynist and racist, according to The Verge. The AI operating Tay learned from and became biased by the engagement it received from Twitter users who were spamming the bot with those ideologies, according to CNBC.

Chaslot said that YouTube's fix to its recommendations AI will have to include getting people to videos with truthful information and overhauling the current system it uses to recommend videos.

""The AI change will have a huge impact because affected channels have billions of views, overwhelmingly coming from recommendations,"" Chaslot said, adding that the platform's decision to make this change affect thousands of new users.

YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Chaslot's thread."

The Justice Department answered the one letter that made allegations about conditions in the Temple by noting that, since the letter dealt with incidents abroad, it came under the State Department's jurisdiction.

With lockdown due to be eased in England on Saturday July 4, the Prime Minister issued a fresh message to people ignoring social distancing rules.

It comes after Bournemouth declared a major incident on Thursday, after a deluge of 500,000 visitors caused chaos as they gridlocked roads and dumped tonnes of rubbish as crowds flocked to the beach.

If similar scenes are repeated and infections spike, the PM says he will reimpose restrictions on the towns affected.

The last week has seen repeated incidents of crowds ignoring social distancing rules across the country.

Mr Johnson told the Mail on Sunday: ""I say to those people who are going out in large groups – you may think that you are immortal, that you won’t be a sufferer, but the bug you carry can kill your family and friends.

""I don’t want a second lockdown but wherever there is a local outbreak, whether in Ashfield or Anglesey, we will empower the local authorities to quarantine everyone who has got it, test back to the moment of infection and make the necessary closures.""

Lockdown decisions in Anglesey, Wales - where there has already been a local outbreak - would largely be for the Welsh government, which has already decided not to send back the island's schools tomorrow.

Over the past four nights, police have broken up illegal raves and block parties attended by hundreds of people in London.

Police in Liverpool ordered the public to clear the city centre on Friday as celebrations after Liverpool FC won the Premier League for the first time in 30 years entered a second night.

Under current social distancing guidelines, people from separate households should not come within two metres of each other.

The rules will officially be relaxed to 'one metre plus' on July 4, when pubs have been given the green light to reopen.

No10 said this week that people could still go to the beach - but must follow social distancing rules. A spokesman said: ""As the PM and other ministers have said repeatedly, we want people to be able to enjoy outside spaces and we want them to be able to go to and enjoy leisure facilities such as the beach.

“But we’ve also been clear we need to ensure we don’t see case numbers start to rise again.”

It comes as a wave of coronavirus infections in Leicester could see the UK's first local lockdown brought in within days.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock is said to be ""examining"" the legislation needed for a shutdown after the city reported 658 new cases in the fortnight to June 16, the Sunday Times reports.

A source has told the paper Mr Hancock is considering ""all options"" to bring the flare-up under control.

But one local source suggested the city council knew nothing of a possible local lockdown until reading speculation from central government yesterday.

Leicester’s elected City Mayor, Peter Soulsby, said yesterday the current reports of where the outbreak might be were “far too vague to be of any real use.”

He added: “There are many different communities and neighbourhoods in that local government ward, and we have no way of knowing which if any of them are being adversely affected by the virus.

“We’re getting that data now, we’re beginning to crunch that information, and hopefully within the next few days, we’ll be able to know what’s going on there - if anything - and if we need to, intervene in the right neighbourhood with the right communities.”

Beachgoer claims huge crowds 'don't matter because I don't know anyone with Covid-19'

Sir Mark Walport, the former government chief scientific adviser, said any new outbreaks were likely to be in local clusters.

He told Sky News: “When outbreaks occur they typically occur in clusters and we're seeing certain work environments, for example, food processing factories, as being fairly common places for those clusters to rise.

""The common denominator is really being indoors, being crowded, being there for prolonged periods of time, noisy environments where people are coughing and shouting, and so there's more droplet transmission.

""It comes back to local control being really important to identify those clusters when they happen and clamp down on them quickly.

""We need to do everything we possibly can to avoid a widespread second wave.

""The evidence that the virus does transmit better in cold workplaces again suggests that winter might be quite a risky time again.""

In its report, the committee said it had conducted numerous interviews with senior intelligence officials and reviewed the analytic procedures that informed the ICA, which was commissioned by former President Barack Obama in late 2016. The committee's report stated unequivocally that it concurred with the ICA's assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign aimed at the election, and that he and the Russian government had developed ""a clear preference for President-elect Trump.""

It also said that further details have come to light that ""bolster"" the ICA's findings about the extent of Russia's efforts to undermine the U.S.-led liberal international order and hinted at new findings by the committee that have ""exposed a far more extensive Russian effort to manipulate social media outlets to sow discord.""

Unlike Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee -- whose final report indicated that the ICA's findings on Putin's strategic intentions ""did not employ proper analytic tradecraft"" and said it had identified ""significant…failings that undermine confidence in the ICA judgments"" -- the Senate report made no mention of shortcomings. Instead, it said, ""the analytical disagreement was reasonable, transparent, and openly debated among the agencies and analysts, with analysts, managers, and agency heads on both sides of the confidence level articulately justifying their positions.""

Of the three agencies that contributed to the ICA, the CIA and FBI offered assessments on Putin's objectives with ""high confidence,"" while the NSA's assessment was issued with ""moderate confidence.""

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee said at the time of the majority's report's release that they had found no fault with any of the tradecraft underlying the ICA.

The Senate Intelligence Committee did fault the ICA on two fronts. It said the assessment failed to provide an updated account of the capabilities of RT, the Russian state-funded television network. And, it said, the historical context provided about Russian interference in U.S. domestic politics was ""perfunctory,"" and could have presented a ""more relevant historical context.""

Mr. Trump has been a frequent critic of the work of the intelligence community in general and of some of the ICA's core findings in particular. Last week, Trump tweeted, ""Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!""

The Senate's report said none of the analysts contributing to it provided any indication their findings resulted from political or other demands, saying it ""heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions.""

""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process,"" the committee wrote.

It also noted that the so-called Steele dossier, which the president and some Republican critics say wrongly prompted or informed an investigation into Trump's campaign, ""did not in any way inform the analysis in the ICA ... because it was unverified information.""

Tuesday's report was one of several the committee will issue as part of its investigation. Reports on the role of social media and on the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia are expected to be completed in the coming months.

""While our investigation remains ongoing, we have to learn from 2016 and do more to protect ourselves from attacks in 2018 and beyond,"" said Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Virginia.

The power of terrorism lies precisely in its pervasive ambiguity, in its invasion of our minds. 1

The statistical chance of being killed by terrorism in the United States in 2001 was significantly lower than dying as a result of a motor vehicle accident. Yet in the same year there was a 6.5% decrease in air travel, 20% of which occurred in the last 3 months of the year, following 9/11.The sarin gas attacks in Tokyo in 1995 resulted in 12 deaths, and another 1,000 people directly exposed: however, 5,000 presented themselves at hospital with physical symptoms.Following the anthrax scare in 2001, some individuals complained of burning sensations following opening mail, which did not contain toxic substances.Scud attacks in Israel resulted in more anxiety-related symptoms than physical injuries.These actual physical symptoms suffered by individuals not actually exposed to a terrorist attack have led some authors to label these reactions as “mass idiopathic illness.”Terrorism results in widespread anxiety, and subsequent behavior change, the extent of which is far greater than is warranted from the actual objective danger, and also far more extreme than irrational fears that are found following other traumatic events. These wide-ranging psychological effects in the general population are, it is suggested, unique to terrorism."
515,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions multiple actors, including George Weigel, President Clinton, Pope John Paul II, and the Catholic Church.",True,"The article discusses the actions and stances of President Clinton, Pope John Paul II, and the Catholic Church.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to support the argument against the Catholic Church's stance on birth control.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead.,"So George Weigel (Column Right, June 16) is perturbed that President Clinton has dared to be in disagreement with Pope John Paul II over worldwide population control measures. Well, I have news for Weigel.

To non-Catholics, the majority of us, the Pope’s claim that he speaks with the voice of God is outrageous. He may be a kind and decent man, but he is no more than that. He is a man. Elected to office by other men. Catholic women, a great many of whom are pro-birth control, had no say in his election.

As for Weigel’s claim that our President’s stance on population control is dictatorial, this is arrogance on a monumental level. It is the Catholic Church’s dictum on birth control that is dictatorial. “Increase and multiply” is bringing this planet to ruin and if allowed to continue will starve the world back to the Dark Ages.

Clinton is right. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church are dead wrong on this issue.

Weigel’s commentary (“A Deep Split Between the U.S. and the Vatican”) was mistitled. The real split on population policy is between the Vatican and virtually everyone else, including population experts, governments, global health advocates, and citizens of every nation who care about democracy and autonomy--not to mention practicing Catholics, who overwhelmingly reject the church’s teachings on birth control, and who do not believe in imposing narrow church doctrine on the rest of the world.

Contrary to Weigel’s assertion, the draft document for the Cairo conference is not “bitterly contested” except by representatives of the Holy See and a very few fundamentalist regimes. All other delegates are united behind the draft’s realistic, compassionate and empowering approach to improving women’s status, protecting individual rights, and expanding access to reproductive health care. To describe this consensus with shrieking epithets like “soft totalitarianism,” “eugenic fevers,” and “a truly Orwellian move” is preposterous.

Weigel says it’s a tragedy that Bill Clinton won’t kowtow to what he calls “the world’s greatest moral authority.” Never mind his offensive chauvinism and the fact that millions of people seek moral authority elsewhere. Never mind that poll after poll shows that even most Catholics feel the Pope doesn’t speak for them on matters of reproduction. The real tragedy would be if a politically motivated cadre of religious radicals succeeded in derailing the most progressive and promising approach to population in history. Fortunately, the collective conscience of women’s and population advocates worldwide will not allow that to happen.

I just wanted to applaud you for publishing Weigel’s politically incorrect, but penetratingly sound article. Weigel’s point--that the Western World is arrogantly and immorally exporting the failed notions of its sexual revolution to the Third World--gets little play in the big media. Thanks for giving it some."
516,False,This article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,False,There is no explicit mention or indirect mention of any actor responsible for a threat or malicious actions.,False,There is no mention of any purposeful and intentional actions by powerful actors.,True,The article mentions the fear of a possible market chaos and damage to the creditworthiness of the U.S. government if the debt ceiling is not increased.,False,There is no connection of events or specific observations to an integrated whole in this article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public in this article.,"U.S. Treasurys prices rose and yields eased on Thursday as an ongoing contest in Washington that has shut much of the government and left the debt ceiling problem unresolved inspired investors to buy U.S. debt, still the most viable safe haven.

Given the gridlock over the budget and healthcare reform that led to a partial government shutdown that began on Tuesday, investors are increasingly worried the lawmakers will not agree on a deal to increase the statutory $16.7 trillion borrowing limit by the Oct. 17 deadline.

Failure to increase the debt ceiling, they fear, would unleash market chaos and damage the long-term creditworthiness of the U.S. government and the safe-haven status of the dollar.

""At this point, the market seems to have a pretty high degree of confidence the Treasury will not miss or delay a principal or interest payment—that other things will give before that gives,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at Prudential Fixed Income, with $400 billion in assets under management, in Newark, New Jersey.

""But if that assumption comes into question you will see the orderly repricing that is going on right now become disorderly,"" he said. ""For the market, any significant doubt as to the timely payment of interest or principal on Treasury securities would be tantamount to the earth ceasing to rotate on its axis.""

As concerns over a possible U.S. default have intensified, the cost to insure Treasurys has soared in the credit default swaps market, though analysts qualify that by noting that that market is not particularly broad or deep.

Economic data took a back seat to worries about the political fighting in Washington.

The U.S. Labor Department said jobless claims totaled 308,000 in the week ended Sept. 28, compared with an upwardly revised 307,000 in the previous week. Economists had projected the latest figure to have risen to 313,000.

This was the last government economic report until the partial shutdown ends.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management index showed the non-manufacturing sector of the economy grew in September, but not as quickly as it did in August.

517,False,This article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,Peter Schiff is mentioned as a Wall Street prognosticator and the chief executive of Euro Pacific Capital.,True,"The article discusses the actions of the Federal Reserve, including an emergency interest rate cut and the potential collapse of the bond market.",True,Peter Schiff predicts a collapse of the bond market and a financial crisis worse than the one in 2008.,False,There is no mention of patterns or connections between events in this article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in this article.,"It’s times like these that get Peter Schiff’s blood running hot.

The polarizing Wall Street prognosticator says that the Federal Reserve’s latest move, an emergency half-a-percentage-point interest rate cut on Tuesday to a 1-1.25% range for fed funds, may be the pin that ultimately pricks what he believes is a raging stock-market bubble.

“The problem isn’t the pin, the problem is the bubble and once the bubble is pricked, the damage is done and the air is coming out of this bubble,” he told MarketWatch during a Tuesday afternoon phone interview.

“If it wasn’t the coronavirus, it would have been something else,” Schiff said.

Read:Coronavirus update: 92,314 cases, 3,131 deaths, at least 107 sickened in the U.S.

The Fed on Tuesday cited growing risks to the economy tied to the spread of COVID-19, the infectious disease that originated in Wuhan, China in December which has sickened more than 90,000 people and claimed more than 3,100 lives and now threatens to disrupt global supply chains and economies.

Schiff, the chief executive of Euro Pacific Capital, is a longtime market pundit and well-known gold bug and his admonitions to investors have been pilloried at times because his persistent and unrealized crisis narratives haven’t always played out. He once predicted that gold would head to $5,000 an ounce, though he didn’t offer a specific time period.

However, he believes this time that calls for a stock-market and bond-market implosion and a collapse of the U.S. dollar DXY, are more likely than ever.

“We are going to have a collapse of the bond market and the financial crisis that’s coming will be much worse than the one we had in 2008,” he said. The bond market wasn’t quite collapsing on Tuesday but the 10-year Treasury note did establish a fresh historic low yield beneath 1%, while the U.S. dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, has fallen 1% this week and gold US:GCJ20, Schiff’s favorite asset, has gained 4.4% over the same period.

It is hard to be too dismissive of Schiff’s predictions as one of his calls—that the collapse of the housing market in 2008 would lead to a global crisis of historic proportions—was dead on, and, perhaps has fortified his status as an investor and commentator who demands some attention on Wall Street.

U.S. equity markets appear to agree with Schiff’s skepticism of the Fed’s recent emergency action on Tuesday ahead of their planned March 17-18 meeting.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, lost nearly 800 points, or 2.9%, to around 25,917, while the S&P 500 SPX, gave up 89 points, or 2.8%, to end at 3,003. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, retreated 3% at 8,684, with losses increasing for equity markets in the aftermath of a news conference the U.S. central-bank chief held to explain the emergency policy measures.

Criticism of the Fed’s action runs the gamut from those who believe the Fed has limited ability to stimulate an economy infected by the novel coronavirus as well as those who believe the Fed should wait for further economic data before opting to inject a dose of confidence in markets that have been prone to wild 1,000-point swings in the Dow in the past two weeks.

The Fed has said that the U.S. economy remains strong and that acknowledgment has puzzled those wondering why the Fed is reducing benchmark interest rates with U.S. unemployment rate hanging around a 50-year low at 3.5%.

Schiff says the move to cut interest rates while the economy is strong supports his theory that the Fed can’t get away from interest rates at historically low levels, after attempting to do so at the end of December 2015. Last year the Fed cut rates three times in succession in the face of intensifying pressure from a U.S.-China trade war.

The Euro Pacific Capital chief says this is the new normal for markets and it doesn’t end well for the average investor. “The Fed never allowed the economy to heal,” he said of monetary policy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

What does Schiff say to those who proclaim him a broken clock who is right twice a day?

“They are betting on a losing hand and I am betting on a winning hand and I want to go home with everybody’s chips,” he said.

Stock-market bulls should hope he isn’t correct this time."

The Dow industrials DJIA, fell 516 points on Wednesday and rose 377 points on Thursday. Say what you will about Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony or the latest jobless claims data, neither can honestly be characterized as a surprise, so what the market is really doing is trying to grapple with the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic and when economies will rebound.

Didier Saint-Georges, member of the strategic investment committee at French asset manager Carmignac, says his firm expects what he calls the Japanese path — “low growth, low interest rates forever, ample liquidity supply, in which case equity indices may trade sideways, but high quality growth stocks keep outperforming.” The risk is that of a prolonged recession that even aggressive central banks will struggle to fight, he adds.

For those looking beyond the next few days, Bank of America has released its view of what the world will look like after the COVID-19 upheaval. “We expect this pandemic to accelerate many macro trends that would have taken five or more years to play out before, from peak globalization, to renewed tech wars and a reappraisal of health-care systems and government influence,” it says.

It sees the rising tensions between east and west, with a third of its analysts now expecting the companies they cover to push for supply chain reshoring. A second theme is the race for tech supremacy, with half of its analysts expecting higher IT spending, and a wave of moonshot investment.

Big Government will be back in a big way. “COVID-19 has handed governments a new social mandate to protect their citizens. Governments will exert greater influence on businesses with shareholder supremacy potentially eroding in favor of stakeholders,” it says.

A fourth theme is that public health will be viewed as national wealth. “COVID-19 will amplify the importance of health care and its social role and accelerate other pressing global public health issues such as drug pricing, antibiotics resistance, future pandemics prevention, [and] universal vaccines for all,” the bank says.

The Generation Z cohort will be “uniquely prepared” for the new era of social distancing, online and sustainability. By contrast, millennials — hit by the “double downgrade” of graduating into the financial crisis and then being hit by COVID-19 — are “most exposed to earning cuts.”

Another possibility — after the crisis is over, is a baby boom: “as seen after many famines, earthquakes, and disease outbreaks.”

U.S. stock futures ES00, YM00, turned lower on the concerns over U.S.-China tensions, with the Dow industrials retreating by around 250 points.

The good news, say strategists at Barclays, is that the gradual reopenings in Europe so far haven't resulted in a second wave of COVID-19 infections. “Dataflow remains dire, there are still many uncertainties about the evolution of the COVID-19 crisis and the old U.S.-China tensions have resurfaced. Yet, we remain of the view that consolidation phases should be used as opportunities to increase equity exposure selectively, as we are likely past the worst.

Scientists at Area 51 have successfully reverse-engineered an interstellar spacecraft. And there's a fully-functional subterranean city underneath Washington, D.C., ready for the president and U.S. Congress to relocate to, should the Elders of Zion authorize their Beijing subsidiary to launch an ICBM first strike. If you believe that, or at least find any of it plausible, congratulations. You might be susceptible to being exploited for financial gain, which is exactly what they want you to think.

Conspiracy theories have probably been around for centuries, but it's only recently that the dissemination of the unverifiable has become an industry unto itself. While publicizing secrets to expose corruption and hypocrisy is a laudable goal, some conspiracy theorists don't seem all that concerned with the veracity of what they claim. If their fanciful theories and loaded questions can translate into money, all the better.

The most ""mainstream"" conspiracy theory peddler operating today doesn't necessarily fit the stereotype of broadcasting via shortwave radio from an underground bunker. Quite the contrary. He's a former governor and a speculative future presidential candidate. He also spent six years as an employee of the same federal government that he currently rails against - though granted, that time was spent in Vietnam with the U.S. Navy's Underwater Demolition Team, a predecessor of the SEALs.

That'd be Jesse Ventura. The erstwhile non-partisan former chief executive of Minnesota is the most recognizable face of an industry committed to setting the record straight about such calamities like the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 and 9/11, even though the record as it stands is as straight as it'll ever be. (Note: Muslim terrorists, and not the White House, were responsible for the World Trade Center attacks). Ventura has written seven books since entering (and then exiting) politics, and as time has progressed, the book titles have gotten more provocative and shocking. His first book, written while in office, is subtitled ""Reworking The Body Politic From The Bottom Up."" More recent titles include ""63 Documents The Government Doesn't Want You To Read"" and ""DemoCRIPS and ReBLOODicans.""

Does Ventura make money from his books that threaten to uncover the truth about, well, almost everything? Ventura would be financially successful even if he'd never written a word, enjoying lucrative careers as both a professional wrestler and wrestling commentator (not to mention a brief film career in the 1980s). While it's easy for any famous person who wants one to get a publishing deal, especially when that famous person has plenty to say, the politically unaligned Ventura showed his independent streak by signing with an unheralded publisher.

Ventura's books have sold in the thousands. At an average list price of $15, and assuming standard author royalties of 15% for such a relatively successful print run, and then assuming that Ventura gets $3 for every $2 that his less famous coauthor receives, that's still a ton of money. That goes relatively far in Ventura's adopted home of rural Baja California, Mexico, but it isn't enough money to change an already affluent man's life.

Ventura's auditory counterpart is Alex Jones, host of an eponymous radio show that purports to tell the unvarnished truth about everything from the concentration camps that President Obama might be preparing to hold us captive in to the hypocrisy of the Federal Reserve. Jones's show is broadcast on 60 stations, distributed by a network far smaller than industry titans such as CBS Radio and Premiere. Jones boasts almost 300,000 YouTube subscribers, but that's hardly a financial indicator. (Rush Limbaugh, the most successful terrestrial radio personality in the nation, has no YouTube subscribers.) However, rough estimates put Jones's net worth at a not unsubstantial $5 million, which is a lot of logo coffee mugs and t-shirts. Jones is a household name only in selected (and well-fortified) households, but his devotees are ardent in their fandom.

That being said, is exploiting the paranoia of the misinformed a path to riches? Signs point to ""No."" For every brilliant self-promoter such as Ventura or Jones, there are dozens if not hundreds of others whose oddball theories about the New World Order and the Kennedy Assassination not only don't stand up to scrutiny but can't be monetized. Concocting alternate realities seldom translates into wealth, a few notable exceptions notwithstanding. But tell that to the independent blogger who's convinced that the media-industrial complex is silencing his airtight explanation of how aliens brought the AIDS virus to Earth. To generalize, the same minds that consider fluoridated water to be a Communist plot are going to be similarly gullible regarding the success of for-profit endeavors.

It's fun and flattering to assume that you're privy to knowledge that the general population is not. And of course, it's not exactly news that politicians and their mouthpieces lie to us at least as often as they tell the truth. But if being among the few enlightened enough to know ""the truth"" is a path to making lots of money, the conspiracy theorists are hiding their riches convincingly. I guess it's still the consumer's responsibility to recognize these scams and stop them in their tracks if they want to avoid falling (and paying) for these deceiving lies themselves. Some are more obvious than others, however, and some are more entertaining than others, too."

The immediate priority was to shore up the international coalition against terrorism, strained to the limit over the bombing of Afghanistan. 

 I have no doubt at all that it is important not just for the stability in the region but for the stability of the world that we see this process succeed 

 But Tony Blair added a new dimension by linking resolution of the Middle East peace process to the eventual defeat of terrorism. Talking to journalists on the plane, he made a parallel with the Northern Ireland peace process - that when there is a political vacuum, it is filled with extremist violence. It was a view shared by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt whom the Prime Minister met in Cairo. He warned that the Middle East problem could lead to many more generations of terrorist groups in the world and that unless there is a comprehensive settlement there would be no safety on the planet. But Arab leaders can take comfort from recent developments. There is no doubt that international pressure is building. Tony Blair has certainly been urging George Bush to reinvigorate the process again - and it does seem that the pressure is heading in the direction of Israel. President Bush talked recently for the first time about the idea of a Palestinian state which was not received well in Israel. But the problem is that there is deep suspicion in the Arab world that this interest in the Middle East peace process - and particularly helping the lot of the Palestinians - has happened only because the US and Britain need to keep the Arab countries on side. One Egyptian journalist asked the Prime Minister on Thursday whether the interest was just part of a tactical move - something which Mr Blair, of course, denied. He said: ""I have no doubt at all that it is important not just for the stability in the region but for the stability of the world that we see this process succeed. ""And this is not simply something we are saying because of the aftermath of 11 September and the need to keep a strong alliance, it is something we genuinely believe. And this has gone back a very, very long time."" But it is certainly true that the events of 11 September have added urgency. A government document called Defeating International Terrorism, which was released on the trip, talks about ""renewed efforts to resolve the conflicts which are the underlying causes of international terrorism"". But many people in the Middle East are sceptical. The leaders Blair has met told him that they really had a problem with their own people who feel that the west has lost interest in the Middle East peace process. There has also been the suggestion that a planned visit to Saudi Arabia has been cancelled because the political situation is so sensitive. So an important part of his trip has been to fight the propaganda war - to win over hearts and minds in the Arab world over peace process and against Osama Bin Laden. There has been a rather New Labour way of framing the debate. Tony Blair talks about ""rebuttal"" which has been a key weapon in their domestic success. So the prime minister has been giving interviews and writing articles for the Arab media, including one on Thursday for the newspaper Al Hayat, which is distributed all over the world. Mr Blair pointed out in his column that Britain, the rest of Europe and the US have always recognised that Palestinians face injustice, writing: ""We have always supported the creation of a Palestinian state, through negotiation, which contributes to the stability of all the countries in the region including Israel. ""That is why in the last few days, we have exerted enormous pressure to get the Middle East peace process back on track."""

In New York federal court filings this week, US Attorney General William Barr and intelligence director Richard Grenell invoked unprecedented claims that the documents remain state secrets, which must be locked down to ""protect the national security interests"" of the US government, despite the president's pledge to help families in the case.

The filings suggest that exposing Saudi ties to the attacks could pose ""exceptionally grave damage"" to national security, the administration said, though the contents of those documents remain a mystery.

Mr Grennell, who was appointed by the president in February, wrote that the documents contain ""highly sensitive and classified national security information concerning foreign government information, intelligence activities, sources and methods, and information concerning foreign relations and foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources"" — all of which ""must be protected because its disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage"" to the US, he said.

Attorney General Barr told the court that even public discussion of and justification for the documents' secrecy must also be kept secret, arguing that a discussion ""would reveal information that could cause the very harms my assertion of the state secrets privilege is intended to prevent.""

Plaintiffs had entered the lawsuit in 2017 to determine the relationships between 19 hijackers, 15 of whom were from Saudi Arabia, and Saudi officials with ties to al Qaeda.

Though connections among some of those men have been publicly known for years through the release of some documents shared in a 9/11 Commission report in 2004, families have sought additional unredacted documents that White House officials have long sought to keep secret.

Following a 2019 White House meeting with victims' families, the president had reportedly pledged to grant families access to documents in the case, ProPublica reported. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

After that meeting, Department of Justice officials agreed to release the name of one Saudi official linked to the case via FBI documents that had been partially declassified.

But the filing could only be read by the plaintiffs' lawyers under a protected court filing. On 12 September, the attorney general insisted the documents' exposure risks ""significant harm to national security.""

This week, the attorney general argued that the ""state secrets"" may contain information about the subject of a national security investigation, the results or sources from an investigation, and ""information received from a foreign government"" through the course of an investigation."

The Senate Intelligence Committee released the findings based on an October 2005 CIA report, one that seemingly underminesone of the tenets thatPresident George W. Bush and his officials have used to justify the Iraqi war.

As recently as August, Bush has publicly stated that Hussein ""had relations with Zarqawi.""

""The report is a devastating indictment of the Bush-Cheney administration's unrelenting, misleading and deceptive attempts to convince the American people that Saddam Hussein was linked with al-Qaeda,"" said Michigan Senator Carl Levin, a member of the committee.

After he was captured, Hussein acknowledged that government officials had met with Iraqi al-Qaeda leader Abu Musabal-Zarqawi, but the report concluded there was no ongoing relationship.

""Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime, refusing all requests from al-Qaeda to provide material or operational support,"" the report said.

The report also contended that Hussein tried at various times to locate and capture al-Zarqawi.

The suggestion that al-Zarqawi was at the very least tolerated by Husseinwas a theme of then-secretary of state Colin Powell's 2003 speech at the United Nations Security Council advocating the war in Iraq.

The assertion that there was at least tacit acceptance if not a relationship was preferred despite statements by Osama bin Laden in interviews and videotapes in the past decade that have generally been interpretedas suggesting that the al-Qaeda leader viewed Hussein as an apostatenot ruling according to proper Islamic principles.

The CIA report also said that its own former director George Tenet, initially cool to the idea of a connection, changed his position at the request of administration officials.

Democrats in Washington Friday quickly seized on the report's findings, but Republican Missouri Senator Kit Bond, a member of the committee, said errors made by the administration did not indicate deceit.

""Yet to make a giant leap in logic to claim that the Bush administration intentionally misled the nation or manipulated intelligence is simply not warranted,"" said Bond.

White House press secretary Tony Snow said the report was ""nothing new.""

""The important thing to do is to figure out what you're doing tomorrow, and the day after, and the month after, and the year after to make sure that this war on terror is won,"" said Snow.

The report released Friday was the second phase of analysis on intelligence prior to the war in Iraq.

In July 2004, the committee concluded that intelligence that suggested Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons was ""flawed."""

At the news conference, he said: ''We would like to show the world that the new Iraqi government means business, and wants to stabilize Iraq. We want to put this bad history behind us.''

Iraqi polls have shown that most Iraqis favor reinstating the death penalty -- suspended last year by L. Paul Bremer III, then the American administrator here -- especially for Mr. Hussein and the most brutal of his aides. Dr. Allawi said his government was reviewing the issue.

But he also dwelled on the importance of fair trials. ''The accused who will appear in front of an Iraqi court will be accorded rights that were denied by the former regime,'' he said, referring to the right to appoint their own legal counsel, free of charge if the defendants cannot afford them; the right ''not to testify against themselves,'' and the right to remain silent.

One cause of unease among international legal experts has been the pervasive role played by a team of several dozen American lawyers and investigators. They were recently reformed into a new unit known as the Regime Crimes Liaison Office and operate from the American Embassy.

But American legal experts in Baghdad said Tuesday that the work of those investigators had been essential. ''The investigative infrastructure in Iraq has been virtually nonexistent for decades,'' one said.

The new power alignment between the Iraqis and the Americans took formal shape on Tuesday with a ceremony in the palace complex, at which John D. Negroponte, formerly the American ambassador to the United Nations, presented his credentials to the new Iraqi president, Ghazi al-Yawar.

Mr. Negroponte, who will lead a staff of some 1,700, arrived in Baghdad just as Mr. Bremer prepared to depart Monday. Mr. Negroponte issued a statement saying: ''The way ahead presents many challenges, but the government and people of Iraq have the courage and ability to succeed. The future is in their hands.''"

• A new study reports that about a third of people in the United States who are working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic are also drinking on the job.
• About 36 percent of men and 26 percent of women said they drink during work hours.
• Experts say alcohol consumption while working can affect job performance and could be noticed by employers.
• The experts also expressed concerns over the possibility that heavy alcohol use could increase during shelter-in-place orders.

All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak.

The stigma of drinking and driving could be replaced by drinking while working if the COVID-19 shutdown goes on much longer.

In such a world, supervisors and human resource representatives might replace the police when it comes to enforcement.

About 1 in 3 Americans are drinking alcohol while working from home during the current COVID-19 lockdown, according to a new study published on the website Alcohol.org.

In the study, officials at American Addiction Centers (AAC) asked 3,000 people in the United States if they were drinking while working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

About 32 percent said they were more likely to drink during work hours at home as opposed to when they worked elsewhere. About 36 percent of men and 26 percent of women surveyed said they’re drinking on the clock.

“Drinking is directly related to the anxiety and fear surrounding COVID-19,” Dr. Lawrence Weinstein, ABHM, FASAM, FAMA, chief medical officer of AAC, told Healthline. “Many in the workforce are in recovery, and this time of social distancing, self-imposed isolation, and uncertainty can trigger a relapse. The stress of work and a pandemic, in addition to many other everyday factors, can cause some to drink.”

“On the other hand, certainly there is a portion of the population who believes that they can get away with alcohol consumption during work hours because they’re completely out of sight of supervisors,” Weinstein said."
527,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Nostradamus as the actor who made predictions.,True,The article discusses Nostradamus' prophecies and their impact on the world.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"As the author of 'The Prophecies,' Nostradamus produced 942 quatrains (four-line poems that rhyme) containing predictions for the future (until the year 3797, at least). And even though he was writing back in the 16th century, he remains a preeminent figure in the field of prognostication. Here's a look at why that is, and how Nostradamus' prophecies have affected our world.

He successfully predicted how his king would die

Nostradamus has received credit for predicting how his king, Henri II of France, would die (the prophet wrote of a pierced eye, the fatal injury that Henri received in a jousting match). And by writing that 1792 would mark ""a new age,"" Nostradamus may have foreseen the French Revolution (1792 was the year the new Revolutionary calendar used for its starting point). Other Nostradamus lines seem to foretell the rise of Napoleon (""An emperor will be born near Italy, who will cost the Empire dear"").

In more recent times, Nostradamus' work has been seen as describing the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. A reference to a cruel villain terrorizing Mesopotamia was often considered to be Saddam Hussein. Even the ascension of Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States has been connected to Nostradamus' writing: ""The great shameless, audacious bawler. He will be elected governor of the army"" (the president is the commander-in-chief of the U.S. military).

Some of his prophecies are more open to interpretation

One thing that helps many people believe in Nostradamus' ability to peer into the future is the overall vagueness of his prophecies. It's a style he adopted deliberately, in part because he didn't want attention from the Church or other critics. It also was a way to draw readers in (besides prophecies, Nostradamus produced horoscopes and almanacs, so he understood how to appeal to the public).

The result is work so general that people can find their own meanings. For example, a prediction about the dangers of global warming can be seen in Nostradamus writing about the sea getting so hot that fish become half-cooked.

Many of his projections were based on historical events

Yet there's more than vagueness behind the popularity of Nostradamus. As noted by Peter Lemesurier, many of Nostradamus' projections into the future were based on historical events. Similarities abound in human history, so drawing on the past gives his work another layer of believability.

The warning about a dictator is clear in: ""Under the feigned shadow of lifting servitude, people and city, he will usurp it himself"" — there have been many tyrants in history, and likely many more to come. Nostradamus also wrote about fire, famine and floods, all of which have occurred repeatedly over the centuries.

Stéphane Gerson has noted that Nostradamus lived in a chaotic time, with wars of religion, more destructive weaponry and political realignments altering the world around him. This is reflected in his work, and it provides a connection to people who are experiencing upheaval in their own lives.

After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, bookstores saw a marked upswing in sales of Nostradamus-related books — with the world feeling unsafe and the World Trade Center destroyed, some found comfort in these prophecies. (After the attack fake Nostradamus predictions of it circulated online, usually combining out-of-order Nostradamus lines with other writing.)

He didn't get everything right

Given the above, why isn't everyone studying his or her own copy of The Prophecies in order to figure out where the world is heading? Well — even though much of his work is vague — there are things Nostradamus just didn't get right.

Nostradamus didn't use a lot of dates in his prophetic writing, but 1999 is referenced: ""The year one thousand nine ninety-nine seven month; From the sky shall come a great King of terror."" Since that month and year passed without any such occurrence, it calls his skills into question.

Though Nostradamus' work has its holes and weak points, it's still had a real impact. During World War II, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels — prompted by his wife — used lines from Nostradamus to convey that the German army was destined for victory. Pamphlets were distributed across Europe with this information, in the hopes of smoothing the way for the Nazis.

Goebbels noted, ""The Americans and English fall easily for that type of thing,"" meaning Nostradamus and the occult. But the Allied powers also recognized how useful Nostradamus could be, with Britain putting together its own pamphlets. And with the goal of increasing morale in America, MGM released several short films about Nostradamus, which made the general public aware of the seer.

Nostradamus wrote about the world ending in 3797, so apparently people today have a few years left. And if you believe in any of his predictions, even the most dire ones, there's still time to do what you can to avoid any unwanted outcomes.

Think of Henri II, the king whose decision to joust led to his death in 1559. If he'd been a little more cautious, and paid more attention to Nostradamus, he might have saved his own life."

In addition, a Sunni cleric arrived at the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad to hear any final admissions from the condemned former leader.

Saddam held a Quran as he was led to the gallows, and refused to wear a hood during the execution, reported the Associated Press.

Afterward, state television showed a man identified as Saddam lying on a stretcher, covered in a white shroud with what appeared to be bloodstains. His eyes were closed.

In Baghdad’s Shiite enclave of Sadr City, word of Saddam’s death prompted hundreds of people to dance in the streets, while others fired guns in the air in celebration.

President Bush issued a statement, reading in part, “Saddam Hussein’s execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the Iraqi people and for our troops. Bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will not end the violence in Iraq, but it is an important milestone on Iraq’s course to becoming a democracy that can govern, sustain, and defend itself, and be an ally in the war on terror.”

Within hours of Saddam’s execution, a bomb planted aboard a minibus exploded in a fish market south of Baghdad, killing 31 people.

Some Arabs predicted Saddam’s hanging, particularly on the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha, would worsen violence in Iraq.

“I don’t have any sorrow or compassion for the man, but the timing is very stupid and Muslims will think this was done to provoke their feelings,” said Ehab Abdel-Hamid, 30, a novelist and senior editor at Cairo’s independent al-Dostour newspaper, reported Reuters.

The carrying out of Saddam’s death sentence came after much confusion about when it would occur. An Iraqi appeals court on Dec. 26 upheld a previous ruling that Saddam and two of his top associates, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti and Awad al-Bandar, be put to “death by hanging” for the killing of the Shiites. Those killed in the massacre had been detained after an attempt to assassinate Hussein.

The execution followed a last-ditch appeal by Saddam’s lawyers to a U.S. court. Saddam’s attorneys argued that, because the former Iraqi president also faced a civil lawsuit in Washington, he had rights as a civil defendant that would be violated if he is executed. He has not received notice of those rights and the consequences that the lawsuit would have on his estate, his attorneys said.

“Petitioner Hussein’s application for immediate, temporary stay of execution is denied,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said, according to the AP.

The Iraqi appeals court had set a deadline of 30 days for Saddam’s execution when it upheld Saddam’s sentence, but in the hours before the hanging, it was unclear if Iraqi officials had to approve the quickened death sentence.

The appeals court ruling upheld a Nov. 5 unanimous verdict in which Saddam, al-Tikriti and al-Bandar were sentenced to “death by hanging” for the killing in Dujail. Four other defendants were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 years to life; an eighth was acquitted.

Saddam reportedly had prepared for his execution by giving a copy of his will to two of his half brothers who came to his cell on Thursday.

His daughter, Raghd, exiled in Jordan, “is asking that his body be buried in Yemen temporarily until Iraq is liberated and it can be reburied in Iraq,” a source close to the family told Reuters ahead of the execution.

The deposed leader also had been standing trial in another case known as the Anfal campaign, in which chemical weapons were used to wipe out 180,000 Kurds in the 1980s.

U.S. forces in Iraq remained on edge in case the former leader’s death sparked renewed violence.

“U.S. forces in Iraq are obviously at a high state of alert anytime because of the environment that they operate in and because of the current security situation,” Defense Department spokesman Bryan Whitman said.

The AP reported that U.S. authorities maintained physical custody of Saddam until the end to prevent him from being humiliated before his execution and possibly mutilated afterward, as has happened to other deposed Iraqi leaders.

Saddam’s lawyers issued a statement on Friday calling on “everybody to do everything to stop this unfair execution.”

But Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said opposing Saddam’s execution was an insult to his victims. “Our respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be no review or delay in carrying out the sentence,” he said, according to the AP.

Saddam had been in U.S. custody since he was captured in December 2003."

The demonstrators come from the coca farming region of Sacaba and are supporters of ousted president Evo Morales, himself a former coca farmer, who has now fled to Mexico.

“I am really concerned that the situation in Bolivia could spin out of control if the authorities do not handle it sensitively and in accordance with international norms,” she said.

Meanwhile supporters of Morales have appealed for calm.

""You dear brothers who are mobilized,” said the chairman of the Chamber of Deputies in La Paz, “I ask you with all my heart, do not engage in confrontation, do not expose yourself to being injured by a stray projectile.""

Morales quit under pressure from the police and military after evidence of vote rigging tainted his victory in last month’s presidential election.

He has called it a massacre of indigenous and humble people asking for democracy."

Throughout the song he repeats the line:

“Did you ever stop to notice

 This crying Earth, these weeping shores?”

I think this is him describing people ignoring the signs and chosing not to notice how the condition of the earth is deteriorating. He also talks about other global issues that people chose to ignore like war and poverty. In the middle of the song he says:

“What have we done to the world?

 Look what we’ve done

 What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?”

I think this is him referring to God sending his only son to forgive the world’s sins. He is saying that we have forgotten about this sacrifice and have chosen not to respect it by not taking care of what God has given us. At the end of the song he makes several references to nature and Christianity. He first says:

“What about nature’s worth?

 (Ooh)

 It’s our planet’s womb

 (What about us?)

 What about animals?

 (What about it?)

 Turned kingdoms to dust”

This is another instance of him talking about people forgetting about nature and animals and essentially destroying them. A few lines later he says:

“What about The Holy Land?

 (What about it?)

 Torn apart by creed?

 (What about us?)”

“What about Abraham?

 (What about us?)

 What about death again?

 (Ooh)”

I think that these are both examples of Michael Jackson referring to Christianity. When he says that The Holy Land has been torn apart by creed, I believe he is referring to the conflict in Israel between the Palestinians and the Israelites. He is questioning peoples faith if they are having war over and destroying The Holy Land. In the second verse, I think that he is alluding to the Book of Genesis and the Blessing of Abraham. He is reminding people that God blessed all people of earth through Abraham and when he says “What about death again?” he is referring to the rapture or the return of Christ. Overall with the mention of Abraham and death again in this verse, I think his message is that there will be consequences if we forget the blessings that God has given us.

The general upward trend that had been in play since early in 2018 seems to have been reversed, or at least thrown somewhat off kilter, in the past few weeks. Understandably, investors may be skittish about the prospect of equities at this point in time, with some calling for the largest recession in years.

On the other hand, there are also analysts who believe that the economy of 2018 is not nearly as bad off as the economy of 2008 was. A recent report by Astoria Portfolio Advisors' John Davi on ETF.com offers a few reasons why investors may still consider equities, and particularly equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs), at this time.

The report suggests that the forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is 15.7, adding that this is ""simply not expensive."" With higher interest rates comes stronger competition for stocks, but Davi argues that ""U.S. stocks are significantly more attractive than bonds"" at those levels.

With the end of corporate earnings season and the coinciding end of the blackout period, investors can expect buybacks to resume shortly. Buybacks could lead to short-term increases in stock prices as the earnings per share levels go up, too. The analysis suggests that the most recent earnings season for the U.S. will mark about 25% growth in profits, providing one of the strongest quarters overall in more than a decade.

After the midterm elections in early November, the U.S. can look forward to a split Congress for at least the next two years. While this does not necessarily signify anything in particular for the stock market, there are reasons to believe that it may contribute positively to equity performance. Specifically, a divided Congress may lead to a change of tone regarding trade policy with China and other countries around the world.

In the report, Astoria Portfolio Advisors recommends a reduction of fixed-income and emerging market equities holdings, as well as a continued underweight approach to bonds. Davi points to the Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (VMBS) as one that his firm has exited, owing to its 100% exposure to AAA bonds at a duration of about seven years. Instead, he says, ""we are keeping duration as short as possible given an environment of rising inflation and higher interest rates.""

Astoria has shifted its approach toward dividend growth products such as the WisdomTree US Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW) to provide exposure to companies with solid return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). DGRW had an ROE of 19.5% as of the end of September, compared with 15.6% for the S&P 500 at the same time.

At the same time, Astoria is moving away from emerging market equities. Davi indicates that his firm ""still believe[s] EM stocks serve a place in a globally diversified multi-asset portfolio,"" but he suggests that, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index at a 40% discount relative to the S&P 500, ""EM stocks are a value play, and historically value and momentum stocks have exhibited negative correlation.""

All told, Astoria finds U.S. equities to be a promising play, at least on a short-term basis for the upcoming months. Following last month's correction and the shifts indicated above, it's possible that this field of names could be heading upward over the near term. ETFs focused on this group of stocks may be poised to win back gains they may have lost during the previous correction."

Beatification, as that gesture is called, is the step that comes before official sainthood.

John Paul, the first Polish pope, had become a folk hero for his opposition to communism in his native land and for his travels to more countries than any other pontiff.

His ceremony was a memorable one. The crowd was shown a vial of John Paul II's blood, and Vatican officials unveiled a huge tapestry portrait of the late pontiff, before calling in both English and Polish for believers to pray silently. Benedict proclaimed that in heaven, the saints and angels were celebrating, too [source: CNN].

Author's Note: 10 Monumental Moments That Were Overshadowed by Other Events

This assignment hit home with me, because I've actually seen it happen on a smaller, personal scale. I turned 20 on the day that Elvis Presley died — I was on a birthday road trip at the time, and it took me a while to figure out why every station on the radio seemed to be playing Elvis music.

The country started reporting deaths in nursing homes at the beginning of April, so the 820 new deaths announced on Tuesday are in part due to this delay.

Coe, the purported leader of the Fellowship, had long expressed admiration for the ways in which leaders engendered loyalty through brotherhood, citing Hitler, Mao, and the Mafia as inspiration. The residents of Ivanwald learned to be humble by submitting to God and doing menial work. The Fellowship, in the meantime, was building relationships with people in power, establishing an 8,000-square-foot townhouse in D.C. where Fellowship-affiliated congressmen could live, hosting the National Prayer Breakfast once a year, and making overtures to world leaders with the capacity to advance a Christian agenda.

The first episode largely re-creates Sharlet’s account of his exposure to Ivanwald, in scenes that (despite casting James Cromwell as Coe) aren’t nearly as compelling as the talking-head analysis of what’s actually going on. The second breaks down the two scandals that threatened to derail the C Street house: Ensign’s very public affair, and South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford’s admission in 2009 that he’d also been unfaithful, in a speech that outed the Fellowship as a “Christian bible study” group that Sanford had been leaning on for support. (In doing so, Sharlet explains, Sanford violated the first rule of C Street, which is never to talk about C Street.) The revelation that not one but two Republican members of a shadowy faith group had fallen from grace led to feverish speculation about the Fellowship, including a lengthy 2010 New Yorker feature that likened the group to “a kind of theocratic Blackwater.”

Moss delves into the Fellowship’s history, and along the way provides a fascinating portrait of an organization that seems uniquely motivated by power. The Ivanwald approach to Christianity, Sharlet reveals, is a limited one—the organization has only minimal interest in the Bible and leans on an unorthodox interpretation of Jesus as a brawny avatar of alpha masculinity, a kind of spiritual Navy SEAL or post-career Peyton Manning. Jesus, in the Fellowship’s eyes, isn’t the Lamb of God so much as a license to expand and project patriarchal power. The young men of Ivanwald are told repeatedly that they’ve been chosen by God to be future leaders, significant cogs in a worldwide spiritual offensive. Coe, meanwhile, uses the truism that Jesus sat down with sinners to justify building dubious relationships with genocidal tyrants such as Omar al-Bashir, General Suharto, and Siad Barre. “Most of my friends are bad people,” Coe once said. In the period after the Soviet Union was dismantled, he visited 16 bloc countries in 16 days.

In its third episode, The Family explores the recent ties between the Christian right and Vladimir Putin’s Russia. (Doug Burleigh, one of the Fellowship’s current leaders, was interviewed by the FBI about his dealings with the convicted Russian agent Maria Butina.) The fourth details the Fellowship’s previous relationships with dictators, and its ongoing attempts to enforce “Christian” and anti-LGBTQ policies in countries such as Romania, with gay marriage in the United States seeming at this point like a lost battle. Along the way, Fellowship-affiliated congressmen seem depressingly eager to embrace strongmen under the pretense of Jesus’s name. Senator James Inhofe tells the Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha that he “loves him.” Representative Mark Siljander travels to Libya, where he asks Qaddafi for forgiveness for the U.S. bombing that killed his daughter. (Siljander was later sentenced to a year in prison for accepting stolen funds from a charity with ties to terrorism.)"

Amid widespread scrutiny of the federal government’s response to the spread of the novel coronavirus, a new report has highlighted a warning former President George W. Bush issued more than a decade ago about the potential catastrophe of not being properly prepared for a pandemic.

Speaking with former aides to President Bush, ABC News this week outlined his insistence on trying to ready the country for the next major outbreak, which began after he picked up a book about the Spanish Flu of 1918 while on vacation in 2005.

“He said, ‘Look, this happens every 100 years. We need a national strategy,’ ” Fran Townsend, who served as an adviser on Homeland Security, told ABC in an article published Sunday. “He said to me, ‘It may not happen on our watch, but the nation needs the plan.’ ”

Former adviser Karl Rove has also reflected on how the threat of a pandemic spread through the West Wing. “I’ve told people more than once during this last couple of months that as scary as the briefings were about the war on terror, the scariest briefings I had at the White House were about pandemics,” he said to Fox News.

Although Bush, now 73, set out ambitious plans to fund new technology to develop vaccines and stockpile much-needed supplies like ventilators and face masks, ABC News reported that as other crises came to the forefront during his time in office, preparing for the threat of an as-of-yet nonexistent pandemic took a back seat.

“Seasonal flu is extremely dangerous for some — people whose immune systems have been weakened by age or illness. But it is not usually life-threatening for most healthy people. Pandemic flu is another matter,” he said at the time, noting that “unlike seasonal flu, most people have not built up resistance to it.”

“At this moment, there is no pandemic influenza in the United States or the world. But if history is our guide, there is reason to be concerned,” he continued. “A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire: If caught early, it might be extinguished with limited damage; if allowed to smolder undetected, it can grow to an inferno that spreads quickly beyond our ability to control it.”

In a particularly resonant moment more than a decade before the coronavirus emerged, Bush warned of the devastation that could occur if Americans were not properly prepared.

“It is vital that our nation discuss and address the threat of pandemic flu now,” he said. “There is no pandemic flu in our country or in the world at this time — but if we wait for a pandemic to appear, it will be too late to prepare, and one day many lives could be needlessly lost because we failed to act today.”

Last week, the White House coronavirus task force announced they believe that, at best, between 100,000 and 240,000 people could die in America from the novel coronavirus pandemic. But officials stressed then that with social distancing and other counter-measures, they would work to ensure a lower death toll.

""I do believe that the Russian Government interfered in the US election, so that is not a hoax to investigate that,"" Gordon told Al Jazeera's Mehdi Hasan in front of a live audience at the Oxford Union.

""I think that Hillary Clinton as secretary of state was trying to destabilise Russia in 2014. I think that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] saw her as an enemy, and I think that he felt he wanted to attack the United States, and this is the way they did it,"" Gordon said during the interview, which airs Friday at 20:00GMT.

It was ""cheaper than fighting a war"" with the US, he added.

However, Gordon said he does not believe Russia impacted the election as far as ""swinging the vote"".

He insisted that accusations of collusion between Russia and US President Donald Trump himself were ""a hoax"" and referred to it as the ""witch-hunt of the century"".

""You had people doing things they should not have been doing, taking meetings they shouldn't have taken, travelling to places they should not have travelled to, but that's not collusion; it is poor judgment, but it's not collusion,"" Gordon said.

Thirty-two people have so far been indicted as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.

Of the 32 indicted, 26 are Russian nationals, five are American and one is Dutch. Mueller has also brought criminal charges against three companies.

Those charged include Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to investigators about his contact with Russian officials, as well as former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's longtime buisness partner and deputy campaign chair Rick Gates and campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos.

All three worked out plea deals and have pledged to cooperate with the investigation. Manafort has also been charged on several counts. He has pleaded not guilty.

Trump and his administration have repeatedly described the Mueller probe as a ""witch-hunt"". National Security Adviser John Bolton announced on Wednesday that Trump will postpone a second meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin until next year after the federal investigation into alleged Russian meddling is over.

""The president believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over,"" Bolton said in a statement.

'He does like foreigners'

In the Head to Head interview, Hasan also asked Gordon what it was like working for a former reality television star who has come under fire for what some say is his lack of knowledge about the world and reported racist and bigoted comments about Mexicans, Muslims and African countries.

Gordon called Trump ""a brilliant man"", adding that he disagreed with the accusations of racism and claims that Trump dislikes foreigners.

""He does like foreigners,"" he said. ""Melania is from Slovenia.""

This Head to Head interview with JD Gordon will air on Friday, July 27 at 20:00 GMT and will be repeated on Saturday, July 28 at 12.00 GMT, Sunday, July 29 at 01:00 GMT and Monday, July 30 at 06.00 GMT."

With the alternative medicine industry as popular as ever, it should come as no surprise that some product claims are more than dubious, if not flat out untrue. Popular even in Cleopatra’s time, the belief in magnetic bracelets as a cure-all continues to be a hotly debated topic. Scientists, businesspeople, and people seeking relief from pain and disease all have their own opinions. Today, you can find magnets in socks, compression sleeves, mattresses, bracelets, and even athletic wear. People use them to treat pain caused by arthritis as well as pain in the heel, foot, wrist, hip, knee, and back, and even dizziness. But do they really work?

Where the theory comes from The theory behind using magnets for medicinal purposes stems from the Renaissance period. Believers thought that magnets possessed a living energy, and they would wear a bracelet or piece of metallic material in the hope of fighting disease and infections or to relieve chronic pain. But with advancements in medicine through the 1800s, it didn’t take long before magnets came to be seen as worthless, even dangerous therapeutic devices. Magnetic therapy enjoyed a resurgence in the 1970s with Albert Roy Davis, PhD, who studied the different effects that positive and negative charges have on human biology. Davis claimed that magnetic energy could kill malignant cells, relieve arthritis pain, and even treat infertility. Today, sale of magnetic products for pain treatment is a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. But despite another stint in the spotlight, have determined that evidence is inconclusive.

So, do they really work? According to the vast majority of research, the answer is no. Davis’ assertions and a have been largely disproven, and there’s little to no evidence that magnetic bracelets have any future in pain management. A of research concluded that magnetic bracelets aren’t effective at treating pain caused by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or fibromyalgia. , from 2013, agreed that both magnetic and copper wristbands have no more effect on pain management than placebos. The bracelets were tested for their effects on pain, inflammation, and physical function. According to the , static magnets, like those in a bracelet, don’t work. They warn people not to use any sort of magnet as a replacement for medical attention and treatment.

Most magnets marketed for pain relief are made from either pure metal — like iron or copper — or alloys (mixtures of metals or of metals with nonmetals). They come in strengths between 300 and 5,000 gauss, which is nowhere near as strong as the magnetic force of magnets you find in things like MRI machines. While they’re generally safe, the NCCIH warns that magnetic devices can be dangerous for certain people. They caution against using them if you also use a pacemaker or insulin pump, as they might cause interference.

Despite the popularity of magnetic bracelets, science has largely disproven the effectiveness of such magnets in treating chronic pain, inflammation, disease, and general health deficiencies. Don’t use magnets as a replacement for proper medical attention, and avoid them if you have a pacemaker or use an insulin pump."

A screenwriter who worked on “Shrek” and other Hollywood blockbusters is developing a new — and apparently sympathetic — movie about Andrew Wakefield, the discredited British physician who launched the anti-vaccine movement with a fraudulent study suggesting that vaccines can cause autism.

Wakefield is already popping up on the big screen in cities nationwide in “Vaxxed,” a documentary that sparked controversy this spring when actor Robert De Niro made and then canceled plans to premiere it at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Wakefield directed and also appears in “Vaxxed,” which strikes a paranoid tone about the “medical industrial complex” and alleges an array of conspiracies to promote vaccines. The movie has been shown in at least nine cities, including Detroit, San Francisco, and New Orleans, since its premiere on April 1 in New York.

The new film is based on Wakefield’s 2010 book “Callous Disregard: Autism and Vaccines — The Truth Behind a Tragedy.”

It was published just after the journal the Lancet retracted Wakefield’s 1998 paper suggesting that the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines could cause autism — and around the time that the UK’s medical regulator revoked his medical license for a series of ethical violations.

Wakefield’s book, in which he frames himself as a truth-teller unfairly targeted by the medical establishment, has been thoroughly debunked.

“It is just terrible. If he handed it in as a term paper as an undergraduate, I wouldn’t pass him,” said Joel Harrison, a retired epidemiologist who wrote a journal article in 2013 rebutting the book’s claims, point by point.

Harrison’s paper identifies a slew of instances in which Wakefield cites dubious sources or draws inflammatory and inaccurate conclusions. For example, it debunks Wakefield’s claim, extrapolated from an anecdote, that “up to 14,337” deaths were caused from an allergic reaction to the measles and rubella vaccine. (Wakefield’s estimate includes cases not necessarily associated with the vaccine and ignores many international studies of millions of children in which no deaths were reported.)

Harrison said he’s worried that any movie made about the book “will do harm” by influencing undecided parents against vaccinations.

A wealth of gold-standard studies back up the scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccines avert between 2 and 3 million deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization.

Terry Rossio, who has co-written blockbuster screenplays for movies including “Shrek,” “Aladdin,” and the “Pirates of the Caribbean” franchise, will develop the screenplay based on Wakefield’s book. He’ll be working with Dr. Jocelyn Stamat, who was described as a practicing otolaryngologist in a press release announcing the project issued last week by the Creative Artists Agency. They didn’t immediately respond to questions from STAT about the project.

“Dr. Wakefield is clearly a polarizing figure, reviled by the general public yet also revered by many,” Rossio was quoted as saying in the press release. “The details and drama surrounding his life are even more remarkable than generally known.”

Wakefield’s documentary, “Vaxxed,” has drawn some sold-out crowds at its limited screenings, according to the film’s distributor, perhaps boosted by an endorsement from De Niro, who called it “something that people should see.”

But Dorit Reiss, a law professor at University of California at Hastings and a vocal critic of the anti-vaccination movement, tweeted that she was one of two people in the theater when she attended a recent screening."

(NFLX) shares fell more than 3% during Thursday's session after the streaming giant announced that it would start shutting down inactive accounts. Management said that these inactive accounts represent less than one-half of 1% of its overall membership base – amounting to a few hundred thousand – and the move was already factored into its financial guidance.

At the same time, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives warned that antitrust momentum is building among regulators. Ives remains bullish on the FAANG companies, saying that large breakups could prove challenging for regulators, but warned that acquisitions could be a slippery slope as regulators may be more apt to scrutinize M&A deals.

Netflix and many other stay-at-home plays have also underperformed during the market's rally earlier this week. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said that the central bank was ready to step in to support the economy, while vaccine hopes sparked optimism that the world would eventually be able to move past the COVID-19 outbreak.

From a technical standpoint, Netflix stock extended its move lower toward the pivot point and 50-day moving average. The relative strength index (RSI) fell to neutral levels of 52.86, but the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) continues to trade sideways. These indicators suggest that the stock could continue its move lower over the coming sessions.

Traders should watch for a move lower toward the pivot point and 50-day moving average near $400.00 over the coming sessions. If the stock rebounds higher, traders should look for a breakout from prior highs and R1 resistance at $460.41 over the coming session. Despite the short-term move lower, the stock remains on the upswing since hitting lows in mid-March.

The measles outbreak linked to Disneyland is raising new questions about whether children should be vaccinated, with health officials and politicians fueling new debate on both sides of this issue.

But supporters of parental choice on vaccines see it differently. Possible Republican presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a physician, told CNBC on Monday that vaccinations should be voluntary. He said he's not arguing against vaccines. ""I think they are a good thing.

When a hashtag deemed to return misinformation is blocked, search results will no longer appear when the tag is clicked, and the terms are even blocked from being searched on Instagram.

Instagram made the announcement at a press event in San Francisco, according to The Verge.

On Wednesday, a report from CNN disputed Instagram and parent company Facebook's ability to keep misinformation on vaccines under control on the platform. The report said anyone searching the term ""vaccines"" could turn up multiple posts and hashtags on the anti-vax movement.

Instagram is the latest company to crack down on false news related to vaccines. In February, Facebook said it took steps to reduce fake health news and anti-vaccination posts amid a measles outbreak in Washington state.

Other sites have similarly cracked down, including Pinterest, which blocked all searches related to vaccines last year. Both YouTube and Amazon have halted anti-vaccination related content, while GoFundMe revealed in March it would block all campaigns tied to vaccine misinformation.

The trend of people choosing not to vaccinate has become a global health threat in 2019, the World Health Organization reported. Also, the CDC recognized that the number of children who aren't being vaccinated by 24 months old has been gradually increasing.

Some parents choose not to vaccinate because of the discredited belief vaccines are linked to autism. The CDC said that there is no link and that there are no ingredients in vaccines that could cause autism.

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 now exceeds the number of American service members who died in the First World War.

The tally for the United States from Johns Hopkins University reached more than 116,700 on Tuesday, just past the 116,516 Americans believed to have died in the war a century ago.

Both figures are far from precise, due to a lack of testing during the pandemic and the challenges of counting the war dead, though historians and the Congressional Research Service say 116,516 is the best figure for World War One battlefield deaths.

The U.S. has the most confirmed infections and deaths from COVID-19 in the world and, as parts of the economy have reopened in recent weeks, cases have surged in a number of states.

WATCH | Premature re-opening blamed for upward trend of COVID-19 cases in U.S:

Texas is among the states reporting spikes in cases, setting a single-day high with 2,622 new infections Tuesday and a record for COVID-19 hospitalizations for the eighth time in nine days, with 2,518.

""It does raise concerns, but there is no reason right now to be alarmed,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said, urging people to wear masks and stay home as much as possible.

The Republican said Texas' health-care system can handle the surge as the nation's second-most-populated state pushes forward with reopening one of the world's largest economies.

Florida's confirmed cases also set a daily record, at almost 2,800. With hurricane season underway, the virus has spread to the team that operates the nation's hurricane hunter planes. Five employees at the team's Lakeland, Fla., base tested positive last week, forcing others into quarantine, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials said.

New cases in Arizona hit an alarming daily high of nearly 2,400 — almost double the previous record, health officials said. The state also reported 25 additional deaths, while hospital intensive care units were hovering around 80 per cent capacity.

In Tennessee, the number of infected patients in hospitals has reached its highest level, at more than 400, Vanderbilt University researchers said. A surge in new cases and hospitalizations has led Memphis and Nashville to delay plans to reopen more businesses and increase capacities for restaurants and retail stores.

Nevada, where casinos reopened almost two weeks ago, has reported 379 new cases, its largest daily increase since May 22. Health officials said it can be partially attributed to delayed reporting but is also part of an upward trend in the last three weeks.

Since the coronavirus emerged in China late last year and spread worldwide, more than 8.1 million people have contracted it, according to Johns Hopkins.The university has tallied more than 440,000 deaths from the disease it causes, COVID-19.

For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

In Canada, the number of confirmed and presumptive coronavirus cases has surpassed 99,400. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial data, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,270.

Here's a look at some of CBC's coverage from across the country:

The dilemmas around how to define deceptive speech and how to check rank duplicity bedevil every modern capitalist society.

Past efforts suggest both key actions to consider and some cautions about how hard the task will be.

The most effective approach depends on a combination of meaningful self-regulation by the business community, innovative fraud policing and the willingness of political leaders and media elites to stand up for truthful public communication. At the moment, perhaps because of the extent to which Americans have come to disagree about what counts as “truth,” each of these requirements seems in short supply.

Anti-fraud efforts have an especially rich history in the United States, connecting such disparate topics as adulterated fertilizers, bogus patent medicines, and fly-by-night mail order firms, endemic investment swindles and bait-and-switch consumer advertising, and, more recently, telemarketing scams and misleading sales pitches for debt products like residential mortgages.

Every generation, Americans relearn that deceptive business practices not only harm investors and consumers, but also hurt honest firms and undermine broader economic confidence. What then to do about it?

One recurring impulse has been to deny the worst liars access to the marketplace. After the Civil War, the American Post Office Department invented the fraud order, which tackled the problem of deceptive long-distance marketing by denying allegedly duplicitous firms access to the mails. In the early 20th century, the new network of Better Business Bureaus began to circulate suggestions to newspapers and magazines that ads from especially dodgy marketers were “not in the public interest.” More recently, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have collaborated on Operation Chokepoint, which has denied sellers of bogus goods and services access to the online payment system.

The problem of fake news has prompted analogous countermeasures, this time implemented by social media companies like Facebook FB, and Google GOOG, GOOGL, . These companies have banned the producers of phony news accounts from using their online advertising services.

Efforts to cast out commercial fabricators from the marketplace have the big advantage of immediate, quick impact. But America’s history of anti-fraud regulation suggests important limitations as well. There is the whack-a-mole problem, since cheats and deceivers often respond to fraud orders and similar tactics by relaunching businesses under different names.

Such summary modes of dispensing justice also clash with American commitments to the rule of law, and so prompt complaints about exercises of raw power that seem more consistent with autocratic regimes. Faced with such critiques, most anti-fraud agencies eventually create procedural protections against unfair treatment: notice of impending bans from access to the marketplace, access to incriminating evidence and an opportunity to mount a defense through formal hearings.

The resulting reforms (in the 1910s and 1920s for mail fraud orders, in the 1950s and 1960s for Better Business Bureau recommendations that media outlets shun specific advertisers) made anti-fraud enforcement fairer. But they did so at the cost of slowing down enforcement actions and diminishing their effects.

The history of American anti-fraud policing suggests there is no magic bullet to the endemic problem of deception in the marketplace or the public square. Criminal prosecutions of the worst offenders can make a difference, though constitutional protections for free speech and the global reach of the internet complicate this potential means of curbing fake news.

Well-conceived public education may be even more important, whether undertaken by government agencies, NGOs or the media. Another emerging strategy to curb bogus news emphasizes this approach. The idea is to rely on crowdsourced tagging on social media of stories as “disputed,” along with work by journalistic gatekeepers to adjudicate such allegations.

Read:The next conversation about fake news needs to be this one

As this example suggests, we will never escape the need to invest trusted arbiters with the authority to label some deceptive practices as illicit. And unless we are willing to tolerate draconian regulatory actions, we will never banish duplicity entirely from our economic or political life.

Our best option is to tailor laws and design institutions with the goal of containing fakery and fraud, an objective that depends as much on the operation of social norms and shaming techniques as it does on formal penalties and the cultivation of savvier consumers of products, investment pitches and news.

This approach is far from perfect. But it can limit the impact of deceitful speech, and so the corrosive threats to our economy and our democracy.

Due to the number of people suddenly working and staying home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for products and services in this sector will likely remain strong for many months to come. In this article, well take a look at several chart patterns from across the sector and try to determine how followers of technical analysis will be positioning themselves to take advantage of the surge in demand.

Active traders who are interested in niche sectors such as communication services often turn to exchange-traded products such as the iShares Global Communication Services ETF (IXP). Taking a look at the chart below, you can see that the bounce from the March lows has resulted in the price of the fund moving back above its 200-day moving average.

Traders will want to note how the 200-day moving average has acted as a strong level of support in the past and how it propped up the price again earlier this month, which suggests that the bulls are in control of the momentum. The recent move higher has also triggered a bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which will likely be used by followers of technical analysis to mark the beginning of a new long-term uptrend. From a risk-management perspective, most traders will likely set their stop-loss orders below $58.49 in case of a sudden shift in market sentiment.

Usurping to many, the top holding of the IXP ETF is Facebook, Inc. (FB). Due to the company's competitive advantage of facilitating connections between people from around the world, traders often view Facebook as a macro bet on global communication services.

Taking a look at the chart, you can see that the strong move from the March lows has triggered a bullish crossover between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The aforementioned moving average crossover combined with the recent break beyond the January highs puts the short-term momentum clearly back in the favor of the bulls. Stop-loss orders will most likely be placed below $213.78 or $197.61, depending on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Another top holding of the IXP ETF that will likely capture the attention of active traders over the weeks ahead is Alphabet Inc. – Class C (GOOG). As you can see from the chart below, the price of the stock has risen above the resistance of the 200-day moving average and triggered a bullish crossover between the long-term moving averages in a similar fashion to the charts discussed earlier.

However, traders will also want to note that, in the case of Alphabet Class C shares, the price has yet to cross above a nearby influential trendline. Bullish traders will likely want to keep a close eye on the dotted trendline because several consecutive closes above that level could be the catalyst to a strong flood of buying pressure. Again, from a risk-management perspective, stop-loss orders will likely be placed below the 200-day moving average at $1321.80 in case of a sudden shift in market sentiment.

Stocks within the communication services sector have become the focus of attention for many traders because of the key role these companies play in the daily lives of millions of people but also because of the break beyond key levels of resistance. As shown on the charts above, nearby support levels put the risk/reward at current levels in the favor of the bulls, and many will likely place stop-loss orders below the respective 200-day moving averages in case of a sudden selloff.

The son of action hero Will Smith and actress Jada Pinkett Smith has been the subject of cruel rumours that he has committed suicide, with a 'video' being uploaded to Facebook which claimed to feature him saying goodbye to his famous parents.

The hoax involves getting permission to post on the user's page on the social media site, and it has been spread for weeks now, with people noticing it on their newsfeed as more and more people click on the fake link.

But the actor isn't the first celebrity to be targeted with a death hoax.

Take a look at some of the other stars who have been accused of being dead below...

Sylvester Stallone found himself as a victim of a sick death hoax, but dismissed the rumours with a fun photo.

The Rocky star shared a snap holding up his fists with Sergey ""Krusher"" Kovzalev.

Without referencing the vile hoax that quickly spread across social media, Sylvester brushed it off with a cheeky smile and boxing pose, proving he's as fit as ever.

“With the incredibly powerful unified light heavyweight champion, Sergey ""Krusher""Kovzalev "" … Whatever he hits, he destroys"" @sergeykovalev (sic),” the actor captioned the photo.

Paul McCartney may have been the first big celebrity to be the subject of false death rumours.

During the height of Beatlemania, a rumour began circulating that the star had died in 1966 and been replaced by a look-alike.

Paul McCartney is obviously still alive and well, but that hasn’t stopped the conspiracy theories about his death circulating online.

The rumours even prompted McCartney to title his 1993 record Paul is Live, with multiple references to the conspiracy theory contained on the album.

Paul McCartney was also the victim of a second celebrity death hoax in 2012, when a fake tweet caused “RIP Paul McCartney” to become the top trending topic on Twitter.

Hollywood actor Robert Redford was also a victim of a ""sick"" death hoax.

A tweet which reported the actor and director had died after falling off a golf buggy in Santa Monica, California, was been blasted as a sick hoax by the star's publicist.

Tributes for the 79-year-old flooded Twitter when a fake news feed, known for falsely killing off celebrities with sick tweets, posted Mr Redford had died.

Mr Redford’s publicist Cindi Berger said ""This is a sick hoax. I just spoke to him and there is no truth to this whatsoever.""

The former child star of Home Alone took to Twitter to dispel rumours that he had died in 2014.

False rumours of Culkin’s death began to spread after a mock tribute page named “RIP Macaulay Culkin” was created on Facebook.

The page attracted hundreds of thousands of likes before eventually being removed.

Best known for presenting the popular children's’ television programme Get Your Own Back, Dave Benson Phillips fell victim to a celebrity death hoax in 2009.

Rumours of Benson Phillips’ death began circulating when it was claimed that he had died in a car crash.

Thankfully the star is still alive and available for birthdays, weddings and other assorted events.

A bogus website called “nbctoday.co” tricked hundreds of thousands of people when they falsely reported that the Playboy mogul had died earlier last year.

The death hoax spread quickly, with almost one million likes on a Facebook page called ""R.I.P Hugh Hefner"".

The 89-year-old Playboy founder is still alive and kicking, but that didn’t stop the death rumours circulating.

False news of Lady Gaga’s death spread over the internet earlier this year, causing upset among fans.

The singer fell victim to a celebrity death hoax when a Facebook page named ""R.I.P. Lady Gaga"" was set up, attracting almost a million likes.

Messages of condolence began pouring in for the singer, who is famous for hit songs like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.

Tenacious D were the victims of a cruel Twitter prank earlier this year when their account was hacked with a message posted claiming Jack Black had died.

After hours of confusion for fans the hacker came clean and confirmed the actor, 46, was still alive and that he had managed to access the duo's official account.

They outed themselves hours after posting the death message, writing: ""Calm down guys! It's just a prank bro, look there's the camera..."""

WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr said Monday that former President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden are not under investigation, despite President Donald Trump’s assertions that his predecessor’s administration committed criminal offenses.

Trump has repeatedly accused Obama of unjustly targeting his associates in what he calls ""Obamagate,"" and has called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to call his predecessor to testify in hearings about the origins of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump, however, has yet to explain what crime he thinks Obama committed.

Barr, during an unrelated briefing on the continuing inquiry into December’s deadly shooting at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, said he would not allow the criminal justice system to be “used as a political weapon.”

“The criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends,” Barr said, before launching a blistering critique of the Russia investigation.

The attorney general has tapped John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to lead a parallel inquiry into the origins of the Russia probe. Barr said the Russia inquiry, led by special counsel Robert Mueller, promoted an “utterly false” theory that the Trump campaign had colluded with the Russian government.

""What happened to the president in the 2016 election and throughout the first two years of his presidency was abhorrent. It was a grave injustice and it was unprecedented in American history,"" Barr said. ""The Durham investigation is trying to get to the bottom of what happened. And it will determine whether there are federal laws broken. Those who broke the laws will be held to account.""

While Barr said Monday that he does not expect Durham's work to lead to a criminal investigation of either Obama or Biden, he suggested that ""others"" could be vulnerable in the criminal inquiry.

In a tweet last week, Trump urged Sen. Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to call Obama to testify ""about the biggest political crime and scandal"" in the country's history. Pressed later by a reporter to say what crime his predecessor had committed and whether the Justice Department should investigate, Trump did not answer.

Graham, R-S.C., pushed back against the president's request to call Obama to testify. ""I am greatly concerned about the precedent that would be set by calling a former president for oversight,"" he said in a statement.

Trump and his allies have seized on the prosecution of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, one of the first targets of Mueller's inquiry, saying that the retired lieutenant general was entrapped by FBI agents into lying about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

""Obamagate. It's been going on for a long time. It's been going on from before I even got elected,"" Trump told reporters this month. ""And if you look at what's gone on, and if you look at, now, all of this information that's being released ... some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again.""

When pressed about the criminal accusations by a Washington Post reporter, Trump added: ""You know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.""

Earlier this month, the Barr Justice Department announced that it intended to abandon the Flynn case, asserting that the prosecution was ""unjustified.""

A federal judge, who will ultimately decide Flynn's fate, has since appointed a retired judge to challenge the Justice effort to drop the case and explore whether Flynn had committed perjury."

John McCain last year and then set her sights on the state's junior senator is suddenly in the national spotlight.

Former state Sen. Kelli Ward said Tuesday that Sen. Jeff Flake's decision to bow out opens a clear path for her to win his U.S. Senate seat next year. But those statements come even as Arizona Republicans are looking for other candidates to put on the ballot because they consider her unlikely to be able to knock off Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema in the general election next year.

""It's not about the candidate, Kelli Ward, it's about protecting that seat and keeping it a Republican seat and keeping the seat, quite honestly, away from Kyrsten Sinema,"" said Robert Graham, the former chair of the state Republican Party who is one of a host of people considering jumping into the race. ""And I don't believe, and many people don't believe, that Kelli Ward is that person.""

Ward pushes back, saying people like Graham and the other potential candidates are establishment Republicans out of touch with the movement that elected President Donald Trump and that they don't like the independence she showed in the state Legislature.

""Some people in the establishment don't like that idea, but the voters do. And that's why I'm not only electable in a primary, I'm extremely electable in a general election,"" Ward said in an interview Tuesday. ""We're on a winning path here, and we're not going to let up.""

Ward, 48, is a West Virginia native who moved to Arizona in 1999 and worked as an emergency room physician in Lake Havasu City and nearby communities. Her husband is also an ER doctor and served in the Arizona Air National Guard.

She said she decided to run for office in 2011 after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which she calls in speeches ""an assault on health care liberty and on health care freedom."" After the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015 upheld the tax credits that help lower-income people buy insurance, she compared the law on Twitter to slavery and prohibition.

She has also drawn repeated criticism for remarks she made about McCain being too old to seek re-election last year and again this year, when she suggested after his cancer diagnosis that he should step down and that the governor should consider appointing her to his seat.

Two years ago, Ward was well known only in her rural northwestern state Senate district. Her statewide exposure was limited to a few items, including an odd meeting she called in her district to let state environmental officials hear from people who thought the government was using jetliners to spray chemicals into the atmosphere for nefarious purposes. Ward has said she just facilitated the meeting and didn't believe in the ""chemtrail"" theory. But it later became an effective political attack that framed her statewide identity.

She stepped down in the middle of her second two-year term to challenge McCain, an icon in the Republican Party and former GOP presidential nominee. She turned what many saw as a laughable, upstart race into a genuine primary challenge, although in the last months McCain pulled away by using his name ID and massive fundraising prowess to handily defeat her. He then went on to win a sixth term in the Senate.

Now she is framing herself as a backer of the president, looking to drain the Washington swamp of what she calls the typical merry-go-round of recycled GOP candidates that she believes is blocking his agenda.

""The people who are stirring this up are in that swampy pot,"" she said of her GOP opponents. ""They don't want to drain the swamp.""

Besides Graham, other potential Republican candidates for Flake's seat include current state university regent Jay Heiler, state Treasurer Jeff DeWit and all five Republican members of Congress, Paul Gosar, Trent Franks, Andy Biggs, David Schweikert and Martha McSally.

It's not just Arizona Republicans who believe Ward won't make it out of the primary. Steven Law, head of a super PAC allied with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that supports GOP incumbents and establishment-aligned candidates, said Monday that Ward ""will not be the Republican nominee for this Senate seat in 2018.""

McSally's name became oft-mentioned as soon as Flake announced his retirement on Monday, because she's seen as electable as a both a moderate and a strong backer of Trump's agenda. Her southern Arizona district is one of just three in the state considered competitive. She has secured it well but is facing a challenge from former Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick next year.

Ward said she would hammer McSally in a primary race and said she needs to concentrate on winning re-election in her House district to ensure it remains in Republican hands.

""I know the Republican Party has already invested a lot of money in Martha McSally to stay in that seat and to stay strong, and I hope that she will,"" she said. ""Because there is certainly no reason for any other Republican to get into this race.""

The Republican hopefuls are waiting for the results of new polls to see who they think could beat Sinema, and Ward, who looks unmovable. Depending on the outcome, more GOP candidates could appear."

“The packages were immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such. The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them. The Secret Service has initiated a full scope criminal investigation that will leverage all available federal, state, and local resources to determine the source of the packages and identify those responsible,” the statement said.

Clinton, 70, addressed the bomb threats made against her. “It is a troubling time, isn’t it? And it’s a time of deep divisions, and we have to do everything we can do to bring our country together,” she said, according to The Hill.

An official told the New York Times that the devices sent to Clinton and Obama were similar to one found on Monday at the New York suburb home of Soros, who was not home at the time. A caretaker called police about the suspicious package.

The device, which was likely hand-delivered and not sent by the Postal Service, was constructed from a length of pipe about six inches long filled with explosive powder. It was “proactively detonated” by bomb squad technicians, according to another law enforcement official who was also briefed on the investigation.

CNN hosts Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto were forced to abruptly end their live broadcast due to the discovery of a possible explosive device. The exact moment was caught on camera and showed how the lights began to blare and a loud sound filled the offices. Sciutto appeared caught off guard by the sudden alarm as people in the background can be seen evacuating.

“This is the world we live in. Terrorism, the attempt to spread fear is the world that we live in,” he stated during a press conference. “In some ways, this is nothing new. We have lived with this for a long time. … Terrorism only works if you let it work. What they are trying to do is scare us and destabilize us. We will not allow that to happen… We will not allow these terrorist thugs to change the way we live our lives.”

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also spoke out the attacks. “These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” she said in a statement. “The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards.”"

“We will do it very soon,” Muneer Haddad, a judge on the Iraqi High Tribunal who will represent that body at the execution, said today. He said the execution would likely be “tonight or tomorrow.”

The pace of events left some of the American legal advisors working on the case stunned, according to one Western official. For all the guidance the Americans provided, in the end the dictator’s demise did not go the way they expected, the officials said.

“It just goes to show that the Iraqis call the shots on something like this,” the official said.

It is still possible that the execution could be delayed, Western and Iraqi officials cautioned. One senior Iraqi official said there may yet be other legal hurdles."

This is staggering considering the man-made substances were only developed in the 1920s and 30s but began to be phased out at the end of the 1980s.

The devastating impact of ODS was first observed in 1985 when scientists discovered a huge hole in the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer over Antarctica.

They soon blamed ODS and this led to a global agreement to phase out the harmful substances.

However, a lot of damage was already done and the new research also found that the man-made chemicals were responsible for half of Arctic warming and sea ice loss between 1955 to 2005.

We need the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer to protect us from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

Luckily, their effects have since started to fade as it is illegal to produce the substances and they do slowly dissolve.

The chemicals used to be made and used as solvents, propellants and refrigerants.

They are entirely man-made so didn't exist before the 1920s.

This made it easy to determine that they were the substances responsible for depleting the ozone layer.

The world sprang into action and the Montreal Prtocol was signed in 1987 and enforced in 1989.

It stated that ozone-depleting chemicals could no longer be made or used.

The research team from Columbia's School of Engineering and Applied Science and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory used climate models to understand the impact of ODS.

Lamont-Doherty researcher Michael Previdi said: ""We showed that ODS have affected the Arctic climate in a substantial way.""

The authors think that their results highlight the importance of the Montreal Protocol, that has now been signed by nearly 200 countries.

Professor Lorenzo Polvani, lead author of the study, said: ""Climate mitigation is in action as we speak because these substances are decreasing in the atmosphere, thanks to the Montreal Protocol.

""In the coming decades, they will contribute less and less to global warming. It's a good-news story.""

The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

In that discussion, some commentators have shown a firm grasp of reality and unapologetic patriotism. Others, however, have been striving mightily to make themselves into national laughingstocks.

There are plenty of conservatives, of course, who have used the opportunity to permanently disqualify themselves from ever being taken seriously again--including Ann Coulter, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. But for sheer volume of imbecility, it's hard to outdo the blame-America-first crowd of mindless peaceniks and twitchy conspiracy theorists. The New Republic, a moderately liberal political weekly, has been running a regular feature called ""Idiocy Watch,"" highlighting particularly lamebrained comments, and the forum has so far been dominated by lefties.

In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorism, writer Susan Sontag found herself barraged with criticism for decrying the ""self-righteous drivel and outright deception being peddled by public figures and TV commentators,"" while assailing our ""cowardly"" approach to war.

Weeks later, her bout of temporary insanity is beginning to look permanent. ""I don't like throwing biscuits and peanut butter and jam and napkins, little snack packages produced in a small city in Texas, so we can say, `Look, we're doing something humanitarian,' "" sneers Sontag in an interview with the online magazine Salon. She fears that the government is about to deport all Muslims and declare martial law, which is about as likely as Susan Sontag being appointed secretary of defense.

Humorist Michael Moore, who made the anti-capitalist movie ""Roger & Me,"" finds reasons to yuk it up. ""Finally, the bombs are raining down on Afghanistan, and as Martha Stewart says, that's a good thing,"" he brays on his Web site. ""Yesiree, I say, BOMBS AWAY! Rockets red glare. We are all WHITE WITH FOAM!"" I don't know about you, but I laughed till my ribs hurt.

Professional moviemaker and amateur paranoid Oliver Stone saw the terrorist attacks as the fault of the Republican Party. ""Does anybody make a connection between the 2000 election and the events of Sept. 11?"" he asked at a recent panel discussion in New York, which I take to mean that the terrorists were bitter that Al Gore didn't win.

Stone searched hard and found something good to say about Osama bin Laden and Co.: ""The new world order is about order and control. This attack was pure chaos, and chaos is energy. All great changes have come from people or events that were initially misunderstood, and seemed frightening, like madmen.""

Does it seem odd to you that Oliver Stone would feel affinity with madmen? Me neither.

Fortunately, you can find plenty of left-of-center commentators who prefer their country and its ideals over those of the enemy. At the New York forum, writer Christopher Hitchens lambasted Stone as a ""moral idiot, as well as an intellectual idiot."" The attack, he said, was ""state-supported mass murder, using civilians as missiles.""

The Nation magazine, perhaps the best-known organ of leftist thought, published a column by Katha Pollitt on why she refused to let her daughter decorate their living-room window with an American flag--which Mom regards as a symbol of ""jingoism and vengeance and war."" (The daughter retorts that the flag ""means standing together and honoring the dead and saying no to terrorism."" Where does she get such ideas?)

But many other Nation contributors have taken a sharply different view from Pollitt's. Writing in the latest issue, Princeton professor Richard Falk agrees with those who fault the U.S. as an imperialist power, but says that critique is ""dangerously inappropriate in addressing the challenge posed by the massive crime against humanity committed on Sept. 11."" The American role in world affairs, he argues, ""cannot be addressed so long as this movement of global terrorism is at large and prepared to carry on with its demonic work.""

Nation columnist Eric Alterman has no charity toward those who feel no patriotism at a time like this. Some of them, he says, ""really do hate their country. These leftists find nothing to admire in its magnificent Constitution; its fitful history of struggle toward greater freedom for women, minorities and other historically oppressed groups; and its values, however imperfectly or hypocritically manifested in everyday life."" For Alterman, ""patriotism requires no apologies.""

Those who feel differently--who can't take their own country's side when it is under attack by murderous foreign theocrats--should find themselves disgraced and ignored long after this struggle is over. In wartime, as leftists like Alterman understand, stupidity is not forgivable."

Millions of people, including pop and film stars and politicians are convinced a secret global conspiracy is taking place in front of our eyes on a daily basis.

The Chemtrails conspiracy theory is one of the most supported on Earth and counts the late pop legend Prince and movie legend Chuck Norris among its high-profile advocates.

At its most bizarre extreme, conspiracy theorists believe that the contrails which form behind jet aircraft are actually streams of toxic “mind-control” chemicals, which dilute before they reach the ground, leaving a gas we breathe in that keeps the general population in check.

But there are a growing number of chemtrail believers, who claim the it is actually a secret global plot to change Earth’s climate in the hope it will reverse the effects of climate change.

Dane Wigington, a solar energy expert and former employee of Bechtel Power Corp, now runs Geoengineeringwatch.org, a website set up to expose the “harmful” conspiracy which has had more than 22.3 million visitors.

He investigated why solar panels at his home lost power as aircraft contrails formed in the sky.

According to Mr Wigington, the contrails, or chemtrails, we see forming behind aircraft most days are carrying out geoengineering.

An introduction to the subject on his website states: “It sounds like science fiction, but it’s not. It’s happening right above you.""

He said a system called ""Solar Radiation Management” (SRM) was being used whereby scientists have tried to mimic the effects of a major volcanic eruption on temperature.

During an eruption, the sulphurous ash clouds would block out sunlight, cooling the Earth.

He said: “Their concept is to mimic the dimming and cooling effects of a volcanic eruption and existing particulate pollution made by human activity."

Unzen Volcano, the Nagasaki Prefectural town of Obama Onsen, which literally means “Small Beach Hot Springs” in Japanese, is harnessing the power of the earth. In the town famous for its relaxing therapeutic spas and some of the hottest natural springs in Japan, the local people have come together to start their own renewable energy initiative.

After the March 11, 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear meltdown at Fukushima, the Japanese public support for nuclear power has waned. Prior to the earthquake Japan received 30 percent of its power from nuclear reactors, but since then all reactors have been shut off with the exception of a recent restart at Sendai Nuclear Power Plant on the southern tip of Kyushu Island.

To supplement the loss of nuclear power, the use of oil, natural gas and solar has since increased to stabilize the energy supply. However, according to reports only 2 percent of Japan’s geothermal resources are used to generate electricity.

The people of Obama Onsen believe that there is another way to produce clean geothermal energy in a way that is rarely done in Japan. Prior to this new initiative, the hot springs in Obama Onsen were noted to waste 70 percent of their famously hot water. The Obama Onsen Energy Plant uses the excess heat from natural hot springs to generate electricity. The concept has the power plant run and funded entirely by collaborating with local people and a company, Koyo Denki Co.

The energy plant uses 100℃ (boiling) spring water in a heat exchanger. The hot water evaporates the fluorine into steam that turns the turbine. Sea water is used to cool the vapor back into liquid for the binary process to begin again.

“However this process still leaves excess heat,” explained Akihiro Sando, an office worker at the plant and graduate student at Kyoto University,”but we can use that for fish farming, agriculture, or even a spa much like the Blue Lagoon in Iceland, which is heated by the Svartsengi Power Station.”

Water is pumped directly from an underground hot spring and fed into the power plant which rests on the seaside of Obama Onsen.

The concept, while seemingly logical for the seismically active country, has an uphill battle before widespread adoption. Most of Japan’s geothermal reserves are located in national parks and nature reserves where construction is prohibited. Further, in terms of output, the energy is nowhere near as efficient as that of a nuclear reactor. One plant produces about 100kw, compared to a nuclear reactor that produces 1,000,000 kw. “Our concept is not to make one big power station, but to make small-distributed power stations. The power stations can be the size of a house, and 20 such stations could power the entire city of Obama,” said Sando.

The tech giant has added to its Transparency Report information on advertisers spending to run political ads on Google Ads services in the U.S.

The database only includes ads from the current U.S. federal election cycle, which began on May 31, 2018, that feature a federal office candidate and not ads about political issues or state and local election ads. Along with a library of political ads that have appeared on Google and partner properties, the company is providing data on how much advertisers spent in each state or congressional district and a list of those who have spent above $500. (See also: How Google Makes Money)

The Trump Make American Great Again Committee, a joint-fundraising committee composed of the President's 2020 reelection campaign committee and the Republican National Committee, has emerged as the top spender with a total of $629,500 spent on 1,321 ads.

In second place was One Nation, a conservative nonprofit public policy advocacy organization tied to Republican strategist Karl Rove that aims to influence Senate elections. Senator Mitch McConnell’s former chief of staff Stephen Law is its president. The organization spent $440,300 on 116 ads.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc., a nonprofit organization focused on advocacy and providing sexual and reproductive healthcare and education, spent $341,600 on 53 ads and took third place in the list.

Ads in the most expensive bracket ($50,000 - $100,000) were paid for by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Priorities USA Action & SMP and the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ads with over 10 million impressions were paid for by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NRCC and Salem Web Network, LLC.

Earlier this year, Google began verifying advertisers purchasing election ads in the U.S. by asking for government-issued IDs and other key information.

On Sunday, the Iraqi High Tribunal reminded the world of that fact. It found Saddam Hussein guilty of crimes against humanity. The sentence: death by hanging.

The evidence against Hussein was overwhelming. He and his henchmen were found guilty of rounding up and killing 148 Shiite Muslims from the northern Iraqi town of Dujail in 1982, in retaliation for an assassination attempt on Hussein there. Prosecutors produced an investigative report presented to Hussein that indicated 10 people were involved in the assassination attempt. Nonetheless, entire families from Dujail were detained. Death sentences against many were issued after perfunctory one-day trials. Nearly four dozen victims died in captivity--often during interrogation.

Unlike other modern tyrants, Hussein stood trial in his own country and was judged by his own people. That is a stirring accomplishment for this fledgling democracy.

Bringing Hussein to justice demanded immense courage; all those involved faced constant danger. During the yearlong trial, three defense attorneys were killed. The brother-in-law of the presiding judge was gunned down. Incredibly, some 200 relatives of victims of Dujail were reported murdered. Several families of witnesses had to be moved into the U.S.-protected Green Zone.

Through testimony and documents, the victims of Dujail were heard. And they are only the first. A second trial is under way. Hussein is accused of genocide for his role in a 1987-88 campaign against Iraqi Kurds, in which about 180,000 people were killed. All told, Hussein's regime is believed to have killed at least 300,000 Iraqis.

Hussein's death sentence probably won't be carried out soon. There are appeals and more trials. But from the famous moment that joyous crowds celebrated the toppling of Hussein's statue in 2003, Iraqis have waited for justice. Now they have it. The debate about the conduct of the Iraq war will go on. But there can be no doubt that it ended the reign of one of the world's most vicious, brutal men."

However, since the market events of the 1990s, they are frequently associated with managers such as George Soros, who is well known to have taken considerable advantage of the European currency devaluations in 1992. Following the Asian currency crisis of 1997, the good reputation of hedge funds has been greatly damaged. They were suspected of having been an active contribution to the trigger of the speculative attacks that led to the Ringgit and Baht devaluations. Academics then assumed that hedge funds might be capable of disrupting financial markets through an intensive use of leverage and derivatives. This atmosphere of suspicion was reinforced by the collapse of long term capital management in 1998. Once more, an isolated event attracted regulators’ attention."

McConnell made the commitment after meeting Tuesday with a group of first responders.

""We want to try to deal with (the legislation) before the August recess,"" the Kentucky Republican told ABC News, adding that he had a ""good meeting"" with the first responders and even received the shield of a retired New York City detective who now is suffering from cancer after working for weeks at the World Trade Center site.

The meeting came two weeks after comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, offered withering criticism of Congress at a public hearing at the Capitol that was attended by uniformed firefighters and police officers but few lawmakers.

McConnell now has ""a sense of urgency"" about the bill and wants to see it approved before Congress goes on its August recess, said John Feal, a recovery worker at the World Trade Center site and a longtime activist.

Approving the bill in the House and Senate by August would be ""way ahead of schedule"" and a credit to McConnell and advocates such as comedian Jon Stewart, Feal said.

Stewart has criticized McConnell and other congressional leaders for failing to ensure that the victims' fund, set up after the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, is replenished.

The $7 billion fund is being depleted and has cut benefit payments by up to 70 percent. A bill pending in Congress would ensure the fund can pay benefits for 70 years.

Stewart, the former host of ""The Daily Show,"" mocked McConnell on Stephen Colbert's late-night talk show last week, accusing the GOP leader of slow walking the legislation and using it as a political pawn to get other things done.

McConnell said last week that the issue will be addressed and that he does not know why Stewart was "" all bent out of shape.""

Feal called Tuesday's meeting with McConnell ""one of the best meetings"" he's had at the Capitol in more than 15 years of advocacy on the issue.

He and other first responders were ""ready to shake hands"" on a deal or ""ready to get into a street fight,"" Feal said, adding that in the end, no drama was needed.

The Senate leader said last week that Congress has always acted in a compassionate way on the 9/11 fund, a statement Feal strongly disputed. The fund has always had a five-year sunset provision, among other problems, Feal said.

Feal told reporters that he gave McConnell ""my version of what compassion is ... and I think we left the meeting now knowing what our compassion is, and he has to match that. And I think he will.""

Feal, who lost part of his left foot in an accident during recovery work after the attacks, credited Stewart with raising the profile of first responders still suffering from respiratory ailments and other illnesses related to the attacks.

Stewart ""put our 18 years of pain and suffering"" in public view at a House hearing June 11, Feal said. First responders shared similar stories with McConnell at Tuesday's meeting, he said.

The bill to replenish the fund must pass the House first. Majority Democrats have promised a vote before their August recess."

Just as FBI whistleblower Mark Felt called out Richard Nixon’s systemic criminality and Karen Silkwood disclosed the massive risks of nuclear power, so today whistle-blowers are explaining how Cambridge Analytica helped to corrupt our elections or how Big Pharma hooked our nation on opioids. In 2019, a whistleblower revealed startling facts about President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, triggering impeachment proceedings.

Whistleblowing is based on celebrated American ideals, such as the freedom of expression, the right and duty of citizens to warn of public wrongdoing, and the importance of the individual conscience. Pioneering whistleblower laws were passed by the Continental Congress in 1778, and by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, at the height of the Civil War.

But as important and effective as whistleblowing has become today, its rise is actually bad news for American society in the long term– a symptom of the breakdown of internal checks and balances on our corporations and our government. This current spate of high-level disclosures by whistleblowers coincides with the spread of cultures of secrecy, of outsourcing public goods and services to private contractors, of increasing normalization of conflict of interest and other unethical practices as clever business models, and the weakening of the very concept of public service itself. Watchdogs are disappearing, as regulators are captured, defunded or drowned out by lobbying, as local newspapers cut their staffs, and with fewer attorneys at the Department of Justice willing or able to prosecute white collar criminals. Corporate and government insiders realize that if they don’t speak out, no one will ever learn of the wrongdoing they see.

We publicly celebrate whistleblowers in the news and in films as heroes, but in real life we allow most of them to be permanently blackballed in their chosen fields. This two-faced view toward people with the rare courage to speak truth to power suggests why whistleblowing is so alarmingly easy to politicize. And since the basic currency of whistleblowing is a respect for facts and the rule of law, the act of whistleblowing, like democracy itself, is at hazard in today’s postfact world.

The former president has spoken with Sanders several times over the last few weeks and reassured him that he had already done much of what he wanted to do, according to The New York Times.

Sanders started strong in the early Democratic primaries, but Joe Biden has dominated ever since and is will be the candidate to face off against President Trump in November.

The admitted Democratic socialist had battled Hillary Clinton hard during the 2016 race, and some believe that a lack of unity in the Dem party led to Donald Trump's victory nearly four years ago.

Obama ended his public silence on Tuesday by endorsing Biden, his former vice president. However, he apparently has been exerting his influence under the radar.

“Biden has obviously achieved something huge here on his own, but the president is a surrogate unlike anyone else anyone can bring to bear - I mean, who has Trump got?"" longtime Obama pollsterJoel Benenson told The Times.

“Getting to the point where he can get Obama involved, you know, that’s a big deal.”

Obama initially reached out to Sanders in late March, according to the newspaper, and he apparently has gotten through.

Sanders dropped out of the race earlier this month.

He said Tuesday that it would be “irresponsible” for his supporters not to support Biden, warning that progressives who “sit on their hands” would simply enable Trump's reelection.

""Do we be as active as we can in electing Joe Biden and doing everything we can to move Joe and his campaign in a more progressive direction?"" he said.

""Or do we choose to sit it out and allow the most dangerous president in modern American history to get reelected?”

He added that “I believe that it’s irresponsible for anybody to say, ‘Well, I disagree with Joe Biden - I disagree with Joe Biden! - and therefore I’m not going to be involved.’”

Sanders also distanced himself from his campaign's former press secretary Briahna Joy Gray, who refused to endorse Biden on social media.

“She is my former press secretary - not on the payroll,” Sanders said.

 Sanders dismissed questions about why he was willing to support Biden sooner than he did Clinton, whom he waited until June to endorse.

He told The Associated Press that recent conversations with Obama did not influence his decision, and that it came down to simple math.

“I will do everything I can to help elect Joe,"" Sanders said.

""We had a contentious campaign. We disagree on issues.

""But my job now is to not only rally my supporters, but to do everything I can to bring the party together to see that (Trump) is not elected president.”

Sanders added that “it’s probably a very fair assumption” that he would not run for president again.

As public health officials, our role is to advance the health of the American people. This must include championing vaccinations.

Diseases like polio, measles, diphtheria and rubella were once common in the United States, afflicting hundreds of thousands of infants, children and adults, and killing thousands each year. Some older Americans may remember the fear associated with polio outbreaks and the era of iron lungs and leg braces — a time when swimming pools and movie theaters closed over concerns about the spread of the crippling disease. Others may recall the heartbreaking wave of rubella in the 1960s that resulted in thousands of newborn deaths, with thousands more born blind, deaf or with other lifelong disabilities.

We cannot let America be faced with these fears again. For those of us who have treated critically ill children with vaccine-preventable diseases, we know firsthand the devastation to the child — and to the family and community — of a death, limb amputation or severe brain damage that could have been avoided by a simple vaccination.

Modern vaccines are highly effective and safe, with most serious side effects being exceptionally rare — and much less serious than contracting the actual disease. But misinformation about vaccines is still widely reported, so we feel it is crucial to state clearly and unambiguously: Vaccines do not cause autism and they do not contain toxic chemicals. That fact was demonstrated again this week in a new study on MMR vaccination by Danish researchers."

The dilemmas around how to define deceptive speech and how to check rank duplicity bedevil every modern capitalist society.

Past efforts suggest both key actions to consider and some cautions about how hard the task will be.

The most effective approach depends on a combination of meaningful self-regulation by the business community, innovative fraud policing and the willingness of political leaders and media elites to stand up for truthful public communication. At the moment, perhaps because of the extent to which Americans have come to disagree about what counts as “truth,” each of these requirements seems in short supply.

Anti-fraud efforts have an especially rich history in the United States, connecting such disparate topics as adulterated fertilizers, bogus patent medicines, and fly-by-night mail order firms, endemic investment swindles and bait-and-switch consumer advertising, and, more recently, telemarketing scams and misleading sales pitches for debt products like residential mortgages.

Every generation, Americans relearn that deceptive business practices not only harm investors and consumers, but also hurt honest firms and undermine broader economic confidence. What then to do about it?

One recurring impulse has been to deny the worst liars access to the marketplace. After the Civil War, the American Post Office Department invented the fraud order, which tackled the problem of deceptive long-distance marketing by denying allegedly duplicitous firms access to the mails. In the early 20th century, the new network of Better Business Bureaus began to circulate suggestions to newspapers and magazines that ads from especially dodgy marketers were “not in the public interest.” More recently, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have collaborated on Operation Chokepoint, which has denied sellers of bogus goods and services access to the online payment system.

The problem of fake news has prompted analogous countermeasures, this time implemented by social media companies like Facebook FB, and Google GOOG, GOOGL, . These companies have banned the producers of phony news accounts from using their online advertising services.

Efforts to cast out commercial fabricators from the marketplace have the big advantage of immediate, quick impact. But America’s history of anti-fraud regulation suggests important limitations as well. There is the whack-a-mole problem, since cheats and deceivers often respond to fraud orders and similar tactics by relaunching businesses under different names.

Such summary modes of dispensing justice also clash with American commitments to the rule of law, and so prompt complaints about exercises of raw power that seem more consistent with autocratic regimes. Faced with such critiques, most anti-fraud agencies eventually create procedural protections against unfair treatment: notice of impending bans from access to the marketplace, access to incriminating evidence and an opportunity to mount a defense through formal hearings.

The resulting reforms (in the 1910s and 1920s for mail fraud orders, in the 1950s and 1960s for Better Business Bureau recommendations that media outlets shun specific advertisers) made anti-fraud enforcement fairer. But they did so at the cost of slowing down enforcement actions and diminishing their effects.

The history of American anti-fraud policing suggests there is no magic bullet to the endemic problem of deception in the marketplace or the public square. Criminal prosecutions of the worst offenders can make a difference, though constitutional protections for free speech and the global reach of the internet complicate this potential means of curbing fake news.

Well-conceived public education may be even more important, whether undertaken by government agencies, NGOs or the media. Another emerging strategy to curb bogus news emphasizes this approach. The idea is to rely on crowdsourced tagging on social media of stories as “disputed,” along with work by journalistic gatekeepers to adjudicate such allegations.

Read:The next conversation about fake news needs to be this one

As this example suggests, we will never escape the need to invest trusted arbiters with the authority to label some deceptive practices as illicit. And unless we are willing to tolerate draconian regulatory actions, we will never banish duplicity entirely from our economic or political life.

Our best option is to tailor laws and design institutions with the goal of containing fakery and fraud, an objective that depends as much on the operation of social norms and shaming techniques as it does on formal penalties and the cultivation of savvier consumers of products, investment pitches and news.

This approach is far from perfect. But it can limit the impact of deceitful speech, and so the corrosive threats to our economy and our democracy.

A huge corridor bathed in artificial light and smelling of disinfectant leads to the bioreactor room at the Actoverco factory, to which AFP was given rare access.

Six hundred people run production lines at the facility in an industrial district of Karaj, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of Tehran.

Technicians wear scrubs, face masks, gloves and surgical caps as they work.

In the bioreactor, cells are multiplied then transferred to tanks for use as cultures to produce medication.

""Much of the equipment that we are using either in production or in laboratory, they are considered as dual-use and they are sanctioned,"" said plant manager Reza Mostofi.

""We have many issues at the moment. Because of the sanctions, usually we can't either transfer the money or the supplier is not willing to sell the machinery that we need.""

As the new coronavirus spreads in Iran, many people have struggled to find medicine -- an issue linked to sanctions reinstated by the United States in 2018 after it withdrew from a landmark nuclear deal.

In retaliation, the Islamic republic has gradually reduced its commitments to the deal since May 2019.

On paper, humanitarian items are exempt from US sanctions, but in reality banks tend to decline transactions involving Iran to avoid being exposed to potential litigation.

""The equipment that we are using, the spare parts and everything, now we have a big issue for repairing the spare parts that are needed,"" said Mostofi.

For the past six months, he said, the plant has been unable to produce a drug that is essential for treating leukaemia.

""For some time we have not been able to import the ingredients of this material, so our line... is now stopped,"" said the English-speaking manager.

The company hopes to produce the active ingredient itself, with a ""very big"" bioreactor, but it faces almost insurmountable difficulties because of the sanctions.

""Regarding cancer patients, we had no problem because we are producing the medicine ourselves... (but) our companies want to renew, rebuild and replace their industrial equipment,"" he told AFP.

According to him, there are 500,000 cancer patients in Iran, and it is the second biggest cause of death in the country, claiming 30,000 lives a year.

Actoverco, part of a family business established 40 years ago, also produces the drug interferon beta-1a, used to treat multiple sclerosis.

""We cannot provide the patients as much as we want,"" said the company director.

""I hope there would (be) a political solution for this because at the end of the day these are people who are suffering"" because of medicine shortages.

He also voiced concern about the new coronavirus.

""Maybe next year there would be a vaccine available (in) some places, but it might not be available here,"" he said.

""This winter we had shortages of vaccines"" for flu.

- 'More and more difficult' -

With the sanctions, ""work has become more and more difficult, you feel it every day"", said medical physicist Maryam Yaftian.

The 30-year-old works at Roshana, a private clinic that opened in Tehran three years ago and is equipped with modern facilities.

She points to the difficulty of obtaining supplies including medicine and spare parts for two radiotherapy machines bought from an American company prior to the sanctions.

For troubleshooting, staff at the clinic hold video conferences with Iranian technicians based abroad.

The sanctions have also caused prices to skyrocket for the clinic which is absorbing some of the increase on behalf of its patients, said its director Touraj Norouzi.

In one room, mother of two Seyedeh Hosseini is receiving chemotherapy.

Thanks to financial help from her brothers and father, she feels ""lucky"" to have been able to undergo treatment for bowel cancer with chemo drugs and an imported infusion pump.

Many patients or their relatives seek chemo treatment abroad as they do not trust the quality of local products.

The director of a Tehran pharmacy, Shahrzad Shahbani, said she had sought treatment abroad at all costs for her mother, who ultimately lost her battle with cancer.

Nevertheless, she said, ""If I had a chemo patient right now, I would not advise them to take local drugs."""

The answer offered both an overdue recognition of the dire times and an early sign that, at last, environmental action might be an imperative in the race for the nomination. Earlier in the summer, many activists had hoped for an official debate devoted to the issue, a prospect that the D.N.C. nixed last month.

The image, which was posted without a caption, appeared to be a reference to Mr Trump’s claims that Mr Obama and the FBI illegally spied on him.

Mr Trump tweeted in March 2017: “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!”

In 2018, the president started a conspiracy theory nicknamed “Spygate” that the Obama administration placed a spy in his 2016 presidential campaign in order to help his then rival, Hillary Clinton.

His accusations against the former US president were refuted by Michael Horowitz, inspector general of the Justice Department, who told the Senate in December there was no evidence that the FBI wiretapped Mr Trump’s phone.

The inspector general led a watchdog report into the FBI’s investigation of certain Trump aides and their suspected ties to the Russian government.

His findings concluded there were a number of “basic and fundamental” errors in the investigation but there was no evidence that Mr Obama or the FBI spied on the Trump campaign.

The report also said there was “no evidence that the FBI attempted to place any Confidential Human Sources (CHS) within the Trump campaign, recruit members of the Trump campaign as CHSs, or task CHSs to report on the Trump campaign”.

Mr Horowitz testified that the FBI’s probe was flawed and called it a “travesty” as agents “failed to meet the basic obligation to ensure applications for surveillance were “scrupulously accurate”.

Mr Trump repeatedly branded the FBI investigation a “witch hunt” and said it was an attempt to overthrow his government.

But the watchdog’s report concluded there was no “documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias of improper motivation influenced the FBI’s decision to conduct these operations”."

Suspect devices were addressed to the previous US president and his ex-Secretary of State — the wife of another former leader, Bill Clinton.

They were intercepted by Secret Service staff who screen post to protect the Democrat figures.

A pipe bomb was also addressed to Trump critic and ex-CIA chief John Brennan at New York’s Time Warner building, where he was due to appear on CNN television.

New York mayor Bill de Blasio said it “clearly is an act of terror”.

The wave of attempted attacks was launched two weeks ahead of elections to decide whether the Republicans or Democrats control the US Congress.

Two days ago, a pipe bomb was mailed to the home of anti-Brexit billionaire Democrat donor George Soros.

Mrs Clinton, defeated by Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, told a campaign event in Florida last night: “It is a time of deep divisions and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together.”

Mr Trump quickly condemned the attempts - vowing to ""spare no resources"" in catching the terrorist who posted pipe bombs to his political opponents.

He told reporters: ""We will spare no resources or expense in this effort.

""We have to unify. We have to come together and send one clear strong message together.""

The ""rudimentary but viable"" devices were sent to CNN's studios, Hillary Clinton's New York home and Barack Obama's DC residence this morning.

They arrived just one day after a suspicious package was sent to anti-Brexit billionaire George Soros.

The Secret Service says the package was identified during routine mail screening procedures at the Clinton home early this morning.

Hillary Clinton was campaigning for the Democrats in Florida when the ""functional explosive device"" was sent to her home, but her husband Bill was at the targeted home in Chappaqua, New York.

A similar device was also sent to the Washington D.C. home of Barack Obama.

An image purportedly showing the device sent to the CNN building later surfaced online.

The picture showed a black and silver cylinder with wires poking out from underneath what looked like black taping.

Devices were also reportedly sent to New York Governor Cuomo and the Florida office of ex-DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

The Secret Service says neither Clinton nor Obama received the packages, and neither was at risk of receiving them because of screening procedures.

It was earlier reported that a similar package was sent to the White House but later turned out not to be suspicious.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement: ""These terrorising acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.

""The United States Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and will take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards.""

Donald Trump Jr echoed the White House response tweeting: ""As someone whose family has directly been the victim of these mail threats I condemn whoever did this regardless of party or ideology.

""This crap has to stop and I hope they end up in jail for a long time. ""

Vice President Mike Pence tweeted: ""We condemn the attempted attacks against fmr Pres Obama, the Clintons, @CNN & others.

""These cowardly actions are despicable and have no place in this Country.

""Grateful for swift response of @SecretService, @FBI & local law enforcement. Those responsible will be brought to justice.""

The president backed up his VP's sentiments retweeting his response adding: ""I agree wholeheartedly!""

Bill and Hillary's daughter Chelsea added: ""Every day, I am grateful to the women and men of the United States Secret Service. Thank you.""

574,False,This article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Edward Snowden as the main actor.,True,The article discusses Snowden leaking information and feuding with co-workers.,True,The article mentions that Snowden's actions caused damage to U.S. national security.,False,There is no mention of patterns in this article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in this article.,"WASHINGTON - A U.S congressional intelligence committee on Thursday issued a scathing report accusing former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of leaking information that ""caused tremendous damage"" to U.S. national security, lying about his background and feuding with co-workers.

In a report endorsed by both its Republican and Democratic leaders, the House intelligence committee said Snowden was ""not a whistle-blower"" as he has claimed.

Most of the material he stole from the NSA was not related to invasions of privacy, but revealed intelligence and defense programs of great interest to America's foreign adversaries, it said.

The committee said that while the ""full scope"" of damage caused by Snowden's disclosures remains unknown, a review of materials he allegedly compromised ""makes clear that he handed over secrets that protect American troops overseas and secrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation-states.""

The committee released only a four-page summary of what it said was a 36-page investigative report that remains top secret, but the summary contained strong words about Snowden's actions and background.

The report contains previously unreported allegations about Snowden and his possible motives for taking government secrets. It alleges that Snowden, who took refuge in Moscow after fleeing to Hong Kong, ""was and remains a serial exaggerator and fabricator.""

It says his official employment records show that while he claimed to have left U.S. Army basic training because of broken legs, in fact he ""washed out because of shin splits."" The report says Snowden claimed to have obtained a high school graduation equivalent, but in fact never did.

It also says he claimed to have worked as a ""senior adviser"" for the CIA when in fact he was an entry-level computer technician.

While the report says Snowden ""stole 1.5 million sensitive documents,"" other sources who have examined materials he turned over to media outlets say that the total is between 200,000 and 300,000 documents.

Some U.S. officials involved in Snowden-related investigations acknowledge that the U.S. government does not know how many documents Snowden downloaded, and that the 1.5 million figure is an estimate.

The report also disputes Snowden's motives for taking and leaking classified information, saying he got into a ""workplace spat"" with NSA managers in June 2012 over how to manage computer updates. It says a contracting officer reprimanded him for failing to follow proper grievance procedures, and he began downloading classified information two weeks later.

However, in 2013, Reuters quoted U.S. officials and other sources familiar with the matter as saying that Snowden began downloading such data in April 2012, almost a year earlier than had previously been reported at the time.

The issuance of the House committee report coincided with the release of ""Snowden,"" a movie directed by Oliver Stone that portrays him as a whistle-blower and hero. On Wednesday, prominent human rights advocates urged President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden before leaving office in January.

U.S. officials have said Obama is not considering a pardon for Snowden, who is facing U.S. criminal charges for providing classified information to unauthorized persons.

Ben Wizner, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents Snowden, dismissed the House committee report as lacking substance.

Wizner said the report's release a day before the Snowden film opens ""is evidence that people in the intelligence community are taking us seriously, that they are concerned that Oliver Stone's movie will help solidify Snowden's image as a true patriot, which he is."""

The Baathists’ long-standing war against Iraqi Kurds was intensifying, and it appeared that Saddam wanted to secure the loyalty of those who worked in Kirkuk’s valuable oil industry. Even today, Dawood, whose father was employed by the oil company, recalls Saddam’s visit a bit giddily: he was handsome in his olive-drab military uniform, and paused to admire the house and ask friendly questions. His cologne was so overpowering that, for days afterward, Dawood couldn’t wash the scent off the hand that had shaken the President’s, and the living-room sofa smelled so strongly that it had to be given away."
576,True,The article discusses a disinformation campaign by the Russian government aimed at influencing the 2016 elections and spreading doubt about the effectiveness of vaccines. This suggests a deliberate and coordinated effort to deceive the public.,True,The article mentions the Russian government as the actor behind the disinformation campaigns.,True,The article describes the actions taken by the Russian government to spread disinformation and create doubt about insurance coverage and vaccine safety.,True,"The article highlights the negative consequences of the disinformation campaigns, such as exacerbating political tensions, depressing enrollment in health insurance coverage, and endangering public health by reducing vaccination rates.",True,"The article discusses the pattern of the Russian government using disinformation campaigns to sow confusion and doubt, as seen in previous campaigns related to AIDS and now vaccines.",True,"The article mentions that the Russian disinformation campaigns were carried out using online software applications known as bots, indicating a level of secrecy and covert actions.","It almost makes sense, in a most devious way, that the Russian government used a disinformation campaign to try to sway the 2016 elections. That campaign has been front and center in many news cycles. But a disinformation campaign that has garnered little attention was aimed at the public health of the United States.

This week we learned that nearly 600 Russia-linked Twitter accounts broadcast disinformation aimed at seeding dissent and confusion about insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. This campaign not only sought to exacerbate political tensions, but it was also implicitly aimed at depressing enrollment in viable health insurance coverage.

Even more frightening is a health-related Russian disinformation effort as insidious as anything we saw in the 2016 presidential campaign. This effort, to create doubt among Americans about the effectiveness of vaccines, was described in an article in last month’s American Journal of Public Health.

That report revealed that Russian agents, using online software applications known as bots, have worked since at least 2015 to create a false impression of surging skepticism about the safety of vaccines. Twitter was the principal channel of attack. The coordinated campaign used tweets to suggest that American public opinion on vaccine safety was equally divided, when it really wasn’t. There’s evidence that these efforts may be working. A recent Research America survey shows a 10 percent drop between 2008 and 2018 in the number of Americans who believe vaccinations are crucial to public health, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t detected an equivalent decline in actual vaccination rates.

The attack should come as no surprise, since Russia has practiced the dark art of disinformation — дезинформация or dezinformatsiya in English — since at least the 1920s. In a foreshadowing of today’s attacks, in the 1980s Russia launched a campaign to sow confusion in the U.S. about AIDS, falsely claiming that the U.S. military had created the virus that causes this disease. This effort, known as Operation INFEKTION, was cooked up in East Germany and would have been well-known to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was once a KGB agent.

Even though there is a strong, well established, peer-reviewed, and tested body of evidence that vaccines are safe, undermining Americans’ belief in the safety of vaccines has huge implications for public health.

Vaccines save lives. According to the CDC, over the last 20 years, vaccines have prevented more than 300 million illnesses, more than 20 million hospitalizations, and more than 700,000 deaths. Reducing vaccination rates would endanger lives.

Vaccines rely on something called herd immunity, which means that at least two-thirds of the target population must be immunized for the vaccine to succeed in reducing or preventing the spread of a disease. With most of the population vaccinated against a particular disease, it has a difficult time getting a foothold. The fewer people who are vaccinated against a particular disease, the lower the likelihood a vaccine program will work.

We believe there are three things the U.S. can learn from the disinformation campaign on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.

First, we’ve learned that the Russians operate from a playbook that links seemingly disparate events. In the case of both AIDS and vaccine safety, they exploited pre-existing cynicism among groups or individuals outside the mainstream, planting doubts without apparent Russian links. For vaccines, Russians exploited a controversial report in the Lancet (that was later retracted by the journal) to exacerbate skepticism of vaccine safety so more parents would decline to vaccinate their children. (To be sure, the article had already generated home-grown anti-vaccine sentiment in the U.S.)

Second, we need to pay closer attention to public health measures that generate fear among those they are intended to protect, like vaccinations for children or fluoridated water.

Third, we must pay special attention to areas in which the West is widely seen as “winning” compared to Russia — in this case public health — making them targets for disinformation campaigns.

Looking ahead, what can we do to thwart future dezinformatsiya attacks? The federal government must take the lead on alerting the media and the public to the risks of purposefully misleading disinformation attacks. Public officials, including President Trump, must show a greater dedication to truth and facts. Whenever a prominent public official espouses support for baseless science, it helps those trying to subvert democracy. By relying on a swamp of bogus science, Russia has exploited loving parents with false, misleading, and dangerous information.

The federal government needs to work with the tech community to develop programs and algorithms to detect threats to our vital health information infrastructure from harmful lies about public health. Once such attacks are detected, Americans must work together to erect cyberwalls to thwart them. Just as the Trump administration this week belatedly authorized sanctions against any government engaged in electoral interference, similar authority must be deployed to protect public health. It’s time to call out and punish Russia for these attacks in terms it will understand, including trade sanctions and freezing it out of our business and financial markets.

Our Constitution makes clear that providing for our common defense is a solemn obligation for government. But our military alone is no longer enough to do this. We now need cyberdefenses to protect our national safety — and our public health.

MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - If you want to hear the resentment people of Mosul feel now that Iraqi forces have driven Islamic State out of most of the city, you should talk to Saddam Hussein.

Not the dictator, but the Mosul schoolteacher, who proudly shows off an identity card bearing the name which his parents gave him in the ruler's honor 45 years ago, and which he passed on to his sons.

The original Saddam, a Sunni Muslim who was toppled in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and hanged three years later on an Iraqi army base for crimes against humanity, is a hate figure to the Shi'ites who make up the majority of Iraqis, violently repressed under his rule.

But here in Mosul, where most people are Sunnis who feel disrespected by the authorities in Baghdad, he is still beloved, just one example of the many ways in which the local narrative veers sharply from that of most of the rest of the country.

""My name is Saddam and all three of my sons are called Saddam, because I love him,"" said the teacher. ""Saddam was the best leader Iraq has ever had.""

When Islamic State fighters swept into Mosul in 2014, supporters of the ousted leader were among those who welcomed the Sunni militants as protectors against the Shi'ite authorities. A group of ex-Saddam era military officers pledged support for the Islamic State caliphate.

Most residents of Mosul turned against the militants during their two years of harsh rule, and the teacher said he never supported them. But few here trust the central authorities that have now returned.

The teacher lost his salary under Islamic State when Baghdad stopped sending money to pay wages of government workers in territory held by the militants. Like many in Mosul, he is now embroiled in a long vetting process to get back on the payroll, which he considers discriminatory and unfair.

When fighting reached his district, he fled with his family to a U.N. camp. He has now come back to his old home, but the landlord is evicting him. With no salary, he has no way to pay rent. The family will soon be homeless, with nowhere to go but back to the camp.

""I have lost everything. I can't feed my family anymore,"" he said. ""I can't pay my rent anymore but I don't want to move with my family to a camp again. I'm really tired of this life.""

The biggest land battle in Iraq since the 2003 invasion, the battle to free Mosul of Islamic State is now in its seventh month. Much of the city has been fully under government control since late last year, yet there is no water and no electricity.

The authorities have put up new billboards with pictures of the city's landmarks or the Tigris river, and messages such as: ""Dear citizens, we urge you to get back to your daily life.""

But beneath them, the walls bear Shi'ite religious slogans spray painted by government troops, which Sunni residents say makes them feel like they are living under occupation.

""Politics are dominated by sectarian and political groups,"" said Wael Faisal, an electronics seller, referring to the graffiti. ""We haven't any development projects from Baghdad in Mosul since 2003.""

With salaries still going unpaid, families are forced to beg for food at mosques. More than 100 former state prison workers gathered in eastern Mosul on Wednesday complaining they had not been paid for up to six months.

""We have no water and power. This is the political corruption we have been suffering from,"" said Faisal.

Many now say that the conditions will create the breeding ground for yet another radical group in Mosul, which became a center for the Sunni insurgency after the U.S.-led invasion.

""I think the future will be worse because the central government will again not care about Mosul,"" said Farnas Talib, a light bulb shop owner in eastern Mosul, which was declared ""fully liberated"" in January.

""What is Daesh?"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. ""Daesh came because of a lack of interest from Baghdad in Mosul. Unless this changes there will be another group, with a different name, different people, maybe no beards.""

An aide to the governor of the Nineveh province of which Mosul is the capital said authorities were working non-stop.

""We have restarted power in some areas for some hours and it will gradually improve further,"" he said. ""We are also restoring water, but some parts of the system got damaged.""

""We are working day and night to serve citizens but our possibilities are limited because support from Baghdad is very limited. We need more support,"" he said."
579,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Arjuna Capital and Natasha Lamb as actors who issued a proposal to Facebook.,True,"The article discusses the proposal issued by Arjuna Capital and Natasha Lamb, urging Facebook to produce a report on fake news.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Sustainable investment fund Arjuna Capital and another fund on Thursday issued a proposal the firms hope will be approved by Facebook (FB) - Get Report shareholders urging the social media giant to produce a report reviewing the public policy and business issues it faces around the phenomenon of ""fake news.""

""We want Facebook to explain how many ads or content they are blocking, how much staff do they have evaluating fabricated content claims and how much are they outsourcing to third parties such as Politifact or ABC,"" said Arjuna Capital managing partner Natasha Lamb.

The proposal is nonbinding, so Facebook doesn't have to respond even if the shareholder vote is substantial. However, a significant vote of shareholders urging Facebook to follow through on the proposal's recommendation could be enough to embarrass the company into issuing a detailed study. At this stage, however, it is possible Facebook will seek to have the Securities and Exchange Commission remove the proposal from consideration. A Facebook spokesman did not return a request for comment.

The Arjuna-Baldwin measure comes as Facebook has come under fire following the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections over fake news stories trending on the social media platform. One high-profile example involved the fake news phenomenon that became known as ""Pizzagate,"" a false conspiracy that trended on social media sites claiming that a Washington D.C. area pizzeria hid a child sex ring in its basement set up by Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chairman, John Podesta.

The Arjuna-Baldwin proposal comes after a recent Pew Research Center survey reported that about two-in-three U.S. adults, about 64%, say fabricated news stories have caused lots of confusion about the basic facts of current issues and events.

In November, reports noted that Facebook had created an unofficial task force to examine the issue of fake news. In December, Facebook said it would start marking disputed articles, with the assistance of users and fact checkers.

On Tuesday, Facebook issued a statement noting that it had categorized pages to identify whether or not they were ""posting spam or trying to game the feed by doing things like asking for likes, comments or shares."" The social media platform said it had set up a system to better ""rank authentic content.""

Lamb said she wants Facebook to issue the report so observers can get a better sense of the scope and impact of the problem since many people get their news and information from the social media site. ""Adding a new flagging system isn't enough,"" Lamb said, ""Investors seek to understand the scope of the problem that is not going away and most likely gets worse before it gets better.""

She argued that the fake news issue could have an impact on Facebook's business success in the years to come and needs to be addressed, especially since the British Parliament on Monday announced an inquiry into the fake news phenomenon and the German government considers legislation that would allow it to fine Facebook for stories it deems ""fake news.""

""What I've been hearing is that people are having Facebook fatigue,"" Lamb said. ""This could have profound implications for the business model, particularly if governments get involved.""

580,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,There are no explicit or indirect mentions of actors responsible for a threat or malicious actions.,False,There are no mentions of powerful actors intentionally pursuing malicious motives or schemes.,True,The article discusses the threat of an intense economic contraction and the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.,False,There are no connections made between events or specific observations to form a pattern.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Covid-19 was officially declared a pandemic Wednesday, and stocks officially entered a bear market, falling more than 20 percent from their peak just last month. The two milestones are related. Even in the best of times, markets are tuning forks not just for the sound of economic activity but for public sentiment about the future. Today, that sentiment is agitated, fearful, volatile. There are reasons to be concerned and to pay attention, and reasons as well to discount the most extreme moves.

Stock prices reflect expectations of future profits, and investors see the virus dampening economic activity and reducing profits. Until the extent of the decline is clearer, the natural reaction will be to sell. On the flip side, markets will almost certainly rebound before the world stabilizes. That happened in 2009, when markets reached their nadir in early March, long before the global economic recovery was certain. And it happened in October 2002, long before economic activity picked up after the tech bubble and 9/11 recession. And markets appear not to be factoring in any government stimulus in the form of tax cuts or new spending, which will likely be forthcoming.

In short, markets are telling us to brace for an intense economic contraction everywhere with little response by governments worldwide. That is possible and dire, but given past experience, it is not likely.

Starting last week as the virus spread through Europe and the US, global markets absorbed that this is no longer a China syndrome. Every economic assumption that seemed valid a month ago is now being reevaluated, and none is being revised upward. The result has been a level of volatility and occasional panic in financial markets not seen since 2011. On Monday, stocks fell almost 8 percent; on Tuesday, they rose 4 percent, before diving again on Wednesday. Interest rates have plummeted as investors flee to perceived havens of safety; US government bonds approached zero interest, their lowest levels ever, before recovering somewhat.

Mega-tech companies have not been spared. The companies that have led the markets—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google—have each shed nearly 20 percent of their value from recent peaks, through Wednesday. Some semiconductor companies have lost 30 percent or more, and high-flying software companies such as Salesforce and ServiceNow have seen major declines. The disruptions to supply chains for computer chips, parts, and finished goods ranging from iPhones to cars are only now being felt. Apple a few weeks ago announced that it would not meet its forecasts for the current quarter because of supply chain disruptions in China, where its phones are assembled; that was before the virus spread aggressively into Europe and the US, raising the specter of lower demand as well as reduced supply. Travel companies have fared even worse. JetBlue withdrew its yearly forecast; United Airlines said that bookings are down 70 percent; Expedia and Bookings.com have seen rapid contraction. Airline stocks are off more than 40 percent from their peak in February.

Unless you’re employed in the financial services industry or enjoy actively trading your retirement income, it’s often wise to ignore market gyrations. This is not one of those times. Financial markets are telling us something that we should heed: The economic trajectory that seemed reasonable even a few weeks ago is not going to be the trajectory for months—not for airlines, not for discretionary retailers, not for industrial conglomerates or small businesses, and not for the tech companies that lubricate everything.

The unanswered question, of course, is how long the disruptions last and how deep they go. The wave of corporate conference cancelations, travel restrictions, directives to work from home, and the almost complete cessation of global corporate activity will exact a real cost on businesses’ bottom line. With more school closings and restrictions on large gatherings, the ripples of these effects will expand. That’s because spending by consumers drives so much of our economic activity, and it is about to slow dramatically. Add to this the plunge in oil prices caused by lessened demand, plus a Saudi-Russian feud over production. That will stress bond markets that have loaned companies trillions of dollars on the expectations of business and risk as usual when the period we are entering is not at all usual."
581,False,The article does not suggest any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions George Soros, a powerful individual, and discusses his decision to stop taking money from outside investors.",True,The article discusses Soros's decision to stop taking money from outside investors and attributes it to new government regulations.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy.,"George Soros has famously impeccable timing. Which is why it's hard to believe there isn't more to the legendary hedge fund manager's decision to stop taking money from outside investors than meets the eye.

In a letter, Soros's firm attributes its decision to new government regulations set to kick in next year that will force funds that don't operate as a ""family office"" to register with the SEC. That stands to reason, since hedgies hate revealing anything about their trading strategies. Staying under the regulatory radar allows Soros to stay in the game without having to keep the feds informed on what he's doing. Indeed, it's not like Soros is calling it quits. The $1 billion he's returning to clients in his Quantum fund represents less than 4 percent of its $25 billion in assets.

So here's another hypothesis: Soros is trimming his sails because the markets aren't as easy to navigate as when he was beating up on the pound sterling in the early 1990s or the Thai bhat during the Asian financial crisis later that decade. The perpetual chase for big returns on behalf for outside investors is today a far riskier proposition. As the investor himself recently said:



At this stage of his career, Soros has more to lose than to win trying to outwit the markets. He's already a billionaire, with a superb record of making money for investors. Another score would only burnish his legacy; a run of major losses, by contrast, would tarnish it. Why keep your head on the chopping block, especially in view of the unpredictable economic and political forces roiling the market?

If ""there is no immediate collapse, nor no immediate solution"" to our financial problems, then now is a good time for Soros to begin exiting the field.

While overall investor sentiment in 2019 was hesitant and bearish, institutional investors in 2020 now embrace the stark reality that there are not enough new domestic sources in development of the raw materials that will fuel the renewable energy revolution. Certain funds, like Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, are taking a forward-looking approach at both the mining required, and also the extraction processes of those key materials. The time between mining of materials and them being available to enter the supply is multiple years in the making.

“The market is starting to realize that while there’s enough lithium to meet today’s short-term demand, overall demand will quadruple in this decade,” said American Battery Metals Corporation Chief Executive Officer, Doug Cole. “And the acute need for resources goes beyond simply developing new mining projects of critical materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Advanced extraction techniques are also required to shorten the time from the mining of such materials to them being deployed into the supply chain- and the process must also be environmentally-friendly and sustainable.”

American Battery Metals Corporation Head of Business Development and Government Affairs, Doug Nickle, says, “the renewable energy revolution necessitates a multifaceted, innovative approach for what he refers to as the “green in, green out” transition. It isn’t really an environmentally sound energy transition if the mining and extraction of raw materials is bad for the environment and there isn’t a sustainable plan to deal with the resulting e-waste created by lithium-ion battery systems.”

Cole continued, “That’s why American Battery Metals Corporation is unique- we are the only fully integrated advanced technology energy company covering the beginning and end of life- and everything in between- for battery metals raw materials. We provide solutions for the market’s upstream and downstream needs through our leading-edge lithium-ion recycling process, proprietary extraction technology, and resource production divisions.”

Each of American Battery Metals Corporations’ strategic verticals addresses the burgeoning need for battery metals, and the company is rapidly establishing itself as a nimble market leader.

American Battery Metals Corporation ( www.batterymetals.com ) (OTCQB: ABML ) is an American-owned, advanced extraction and battery recycling technology company with valuable mineral resources in Nevada. The company is focused on its lithium-ion battery recycling and resource production projects in Nevada, with the goal of becoming a substantial domestic supplier of battery metals to the rapidly growing electric vehicle and battery storage markets.

In its infancy, the IMF was only responsible for supervising pegged exchange rates, part of the Bretton Woods dollar-gold reserve currency scheme.﻿﻿

The IMF grew in scope and influence in subsequent decades, particularly after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s.﻿﻿ Now the IMF provides loans to help member nations fix perceived balance of payments problems and fight off crises.﻿﻿ The most notorious example was the bailout of the Greek government in 2011.﻿﻿

As of 2019, the IMF has 189 member nations. Each member nation publicly accepts and supports the goal of global economic stability and, in theory, a subjugation of some sovereign authority to support that goal. The IMF is funded mainly through what are called ""quota contributions"" from its members. Each IMF member nation is assigned an annual quota amount, based on the size of its economy when it joins the IMF. The IMF also has substantial gold holdings that it can sell and is authorized to borrow up to an amount approximately equal to its annual quota contributions.﻿﻿

IMF supporters claim it is a necessary lender of last resort for areas in crisis and it can impose necessary or difficult reforms on backward economies. Critics counter the IMF supersedes national autonomy, exacerbates economic problems more often than not, and serves as a tool for the wealthiest nations only.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿

Economists also frequently criticize the IMF for creating a moral hazard on national scales.﻿﻿

The IMF assists member nations in several different capacities.

Its most important function is its ability to provide loans to member nations in need of a bailout. The IMF can attach conditions to these loans, including prescribed economic policies, to which borrowing governments must comply.﻿﻿

If a country has a balance of payments deficit, the IMF can step in to fill the gap.﻿﻿

It serves as a council and adviser to countries attempting a new economic policy.﻿﻿ It also publishes papers on new economic topics.﻿﻿

Despite its lofty status and commendable objectives, the IMF is attempting to pull off a nearly impossible economic feat: perfectly timing and sizing economic intervention on an international scale. It suffers criticism for the following:

Too Much or Too Little Intervention

The IMF has been criticized for not doing much and for overreaching. It has been criticized for being too slow or too eager to assist failing national policies. Since the United States, Japan, and Great Britain feature prominently in IMF policies, it has been accused of being a tool for free-market countries only.﻿﻿ Simultaneously, free-market supporters criticize the IMF for being too interventionist.﻿﻿

Some member nations, such as Italy and Greece, have been accused of pursuing unsustainable budgets because they believed the world community, led by the IMF, would come to their rescue.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ This is no different than the moral hazard created by government bailouts of major banks."

According to a new study from experts at University of California, Berkley, the Google-owned platform has succeeded in reducing conspiracy recommendations.

The study analyzed more than 8 million video recommendations over the past 15 months and employed the use of an algorithm that rated videos - reading their title and description as well as the comment - on a scale of 0 to 1 for likelihood that it pedaled conspiracies.

To help account for errors they only counted videos that scored a .5 or higher on its scale.

Researchers found that YouTube's claim that it had lowered conspiracy video recommendations by 50 percent in June last year to be 'mostly consistent' with their own analysis though that number is constantly changing.

The study says conspiracy videos are now about 40 percent less common than they were since their low point in June.

In 2018, the amount of conspiracy videos being recommended peaked with about 10 percent of all suggested content being conspiratorial in nature.

Researchers say that the platform's efforts have varied depending on category.

For instance, they say it has all but wiped out some categories of conspiracy videos including flat earth theories and videos that claim that the US government orchestrated the September 11 terror attacks in New York City.

Other varieties of video have been allowed to remain on the platform, however, including those alleging the Great Pyramids were built be aliens and others denying human-driven climate change.

This disparity could be more of a matter of YouTube's priorities according to researchers, with the company attempting to hash out what it qualifies as a threat to its users and the public and what should remain.

Though the efforts mark significant progress, researchers are quick to note that the YouTube's continued efforts don't necessarily signify a victory over conspiracies on the platform.

In fact, they say that the threat of radicalization on YouTube remains as present as ever

'The overall reduction of conspiratorial recommendations is an encouraging trend. Nonetheless, this reduction does not make the problem of radicalization on YouTube obsolete nor fictional, as some have claimed,' they write.

Though the study was among the most comprehensive analyses of conspiracy videos on YouTube, researchers were not able to draw a linkage between the decline and likelihood that one might be radicalized by watching the content.

As noted by the New York Times, researchers were only able to assess videos recommended on YouTube without being logged in, meaning that personalized recommendations, which the majority of its users interface with, is still an unknown.

Until a study formulates a way to account for the personalized videos of an individual user, researchers say it will be impossible to judge the actual impacts that conspiracy videos have on radicalization."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's remarks over the last week have been making headlines, but the latest may be the most controversial.

When asked about reparations for slavery on the eve of a House hearing on the issue, McConnell said reparations ""for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible,"" were not a good idea. Besides, he suggested acts, such as electing Barack Obama president, could be considered a form of compensation.

""We tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a Civil War, by passing landmark civil rights legislation, elected an African American president,"" McConnell said. ""I don't think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it. First of all, it would be hard to figure out whom to compensate.""

The backlash, as it often happens with McConnell, came swiftly.

Recent headlines: McConnell was behind kicking Jenean Hampton off Bevin's reelection ticket, fired aide says

Kentucky state Rep. Charles Booker (D-43rd District) wrote on Twitter that the ""shameful"" remarks showed McConnell doesn't care about black people or Louisville's West End, and that Kentucky needs to stand against McConnell during his reelection bid.

Kevin Cosby, president of Simmons College in Louisville and senior pastor at St. Stephen Church in the West End, called the comment ""the most ignorant, historically inaccurate statement ever uttered by a ranking senator.""

McConnell was Obama's chief adversary during his presidency. He once quipped that his top goal was to make Obama a one-term president and famously blocked Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court during the final year of his presidency.

Recent headlines: McConnell on a potential 2020 SCOTUS vacancy: 'Oh, we'd fill it'

The criticism of McConnell came as the senator was taking heat for comments he made Monday about the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund.

After emotional testimony last week by former ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart in support of reauthorizing the fund to help pay for medical and economic losses for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and their families, McConnell said in a Fox News interview that he didn't know why Stewart was ""all bent out of shape"" and that ""many things in Congress happen at the last minute.""

Stewart jumped on those comments, appearing on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" later Monday and accusing the senator of only supporting the 9/11 community when it's convenient and using it ""as a political pawn to get other things you want.""

McConnell, during his Monday interview on Fox News, added that the Senate ""will address this problem appropriately"" after the House takes up the bill before the August work period. A spokesman for McConnell on Wednesday said the Senate will take action after the House acts.

McConnell, in the meantime, appeared on Fox News on Thursday night and Monday morning to repeatedly discuss socialism (""none of these socialist schemes, the ‘Green New Deal,’ ‘Medicare for All,’ are going to pass the Senate""), Iran (""The sanctions are really hurting. The president made the right decision backing out of the nuclear deal because it wasn't much of a deal"") and other issues.

He deflected questions Thursday night about President Donald Trump's ABC News interview in which he said he would accept damaging information about a political opponent from a foreign government ahead of an election. Trump has since walked back those remarks.

China’s general administration of customs said on its website it had decided on the suspension after the company confirmed a cluster of Covid-19 cases at the plant, which is located in the town of Springdale.

Tyson’s spokesman Gary Mickelson said the company was looking into the issue, adding that the company works closely with US authorities to ensure its food complies with government safety requirements.

“It is important to note that the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USDA and the US Food and Drug Administration agree that there is no evidence to support transmission of Covid-19 associated with food,” he said in an email.

The biggest increase was from North and South America with more than 116,000 new cases, according to its daily report. Total global cases are over 8.7 million with more than 461,000 deaths, according to the WHO. The previous record for new cases was 181,232 on 18 June. Most - more than 50,000 - came from Brazil, followed by the US and India.

Imports of US poultry to China have surged since Beijing ended an almost five-year ban on the trade in November 2019.

But authorities in the capital have stepped up oversight of imported foods after a new cluster of coronavirus cases were linked to a sprawling wholesale food market in Beijing just over a week ago. The city began testing meat, seafood and fresh produce last week and some ports were opening all containers of meat to carry out coronavirus tests.

On Friday, customs asked food exporters to sign a declaration that their produce is not contaminated by the virus.

The new Covid-19 outbreak, centred on the Xinfadi market in Beijing, prompted the swift reintroduction of restrictions in the capital, including residential lockdowns in 40 communities, travel restrictions, and school closures. More than 2 million people have been tested for the virus in Beijing in the past two weeks, according to the state-run Global Times. It said more than 200 people have now been confirmed with Covid-19 in the capital.

On Monday, China reported 18 new coronavirus cases, nine of which were in the capital. Local authorities are restricting movement of people in the capital and stepping up other measures to prevent the virus from spreading following a series of local infections.

Health authorities said Beijing had doubled its nucleic acid testing capacity from 100,000 a day to 230,000 a day.

China and the European Union will hold a video summit on the coronavirus on Monday, their first formal talks since ties soured over European accusations that Beijing has spread disinformation about the coronavirus.

“We are ready to work with China. But we also expect China to assume its responsibilities as one of the world’s largest economies,” said a senior official helping prepare the summit.

China’s People’s Daily said the meeting was a chance to “inject more confidence” into the global economy. In a barely veiled slight to the US, the People’s Daily said the “mutual support between China and Europe has set an example for the global epidemic battle”.

At Donald Trump’s first campaign rally since the pandemic, he again blamed China for the coronavirus, calling it “kung flu”. Last week Washington questioned China’s credibility on accurately reporting the new Covid-19 cluster in Beijing.

Health authorities in South Korea said for the first time on Monday it was in the midst of a second wave of infections focused around its densely populated capital, stemming from a holiday in May.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had previously said South Korea’s first wave had never really ended. But on Monday, the KCDC director, Jeong Eun-kyeong, said it had become clear that a holiday weekend in early May marked the beginning of a new wave of infections focused in the greater Seoul area, which had previously recorded few cases.

“In the metropolitan area, we believe that the first wave was from March to April as well as February to March,” Jeong said at a regular briefing. “Then we see that the second wave which was triggered by the May holiday has been going on.”

Now these fundamental linkages have a new official definition that broadens the situations in which they can arise. It should allow various chemical reactions and behaviours to be better modelled and understood.

Unlike covalent bonds, which hold atoms together to form molecules, weaker hydrogen bonds form between molecules. They arise when a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to an electron-hungry, or electronegative, atom that tugs on hydrogen’s electron cloud, creating a partial positive charge at its other edge. The H bond forms between that charge and an electron-rich atom on another molecule.

These bonds govern the way the molecules fold up, like DNA’s double helix. They also change their bulk properties: without H bonding, it would take less energy to separate water molecules from each other so water would boil at a lower temperature. But an exact definition has proved elusive. Scientists argue about exactly which atoms must be involved for an interaction to be classified as an H bond, as well as the bond’s spectroscopic signatures and the forces that hold it together.

A previous definition, from the 1997 version of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)’s Gold Book, lists nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine – some of the most electronegative atoms in the periodic table – as most likely to tug on hydrogen’s electron cloud and lead to an H bond. Recent experiments have found this definition wanting. It’s now clear that a hydrogen bonded to a carbon, which is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen, but much less than nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine, can still form an H bond in some circumstances.

So, under the new definition, the brainchild of an IUPAC committee, an atom bonded to hydrogen need only be more electronegative than the hydrogen itself to be a candidate for an H bond. Spectroscopic observations, or even computer simulations, could then show that the particular interaction meets the criteria to be an H bond, such as having the characteristic bond length, angle or energy density (Pure and Applied Chemistry, DOI: 10.1351/pac-rec-10-01-02).

The new definition could improve computer models used to predict molecular structure, says Steven Scheiner of Utah State University in Logan who co-led the IUPAC group. Current versions don’t allow for the possibility of hydrogen bonds forming between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a carbon and sitting near an oxygen, even though it is now clear this is possible.

Charles Perrin at the University of California, San Diego, who was not on the IUPAC committee, likes the fact that the bond can now be experimentally verified. “Chemistry has all sorts of fuzzy definitions,” he explains. At the same time, having several criteria allows for some much-needed wiggle room, he says.

Committee member Joseph Dannenberg of Hunter College in New York says the new definition should be useful: “It’s something people use everyday.” Scheiner warns that it could change as we continue to unravel the complex interactions that make up a hydrogen bond."

The admission on Friday by Mr. Jones, the host of “The Alex Jones Show” and the operator of the website Infowars, was striking. In addition to promoting the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, he has contended that the Sept. 11 attacks were inside jobs carried out by the United States government and that the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax concocted by those hostile to the Second Amendment.

The Pizzagate theory, which posited with no evidence that top Democratic officials were involved with a satanic child pornography ring centered around Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., grew in online forums before making its way to more visible venues, including Mr. Jones’s show. And its prominence after the election drew attention to the proliferation of false and misleading news, much of it politically charged, that circulated on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Mr. Jones made the apology to the owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, on video, reading from a carefully worded statement that emphasized how widely the theory had spread before he weighed in on it. He said that Infowars had “disassociated” itself from the story in December and had taken down the majority of broadcasts and videos that mentioned it. Mr. Jones also said that two reporters the show had worked with “are no longer with us,” although he did not identify them or discuss the exact nature of their work with Infowars."

The last time measles cases soared to this level was in 1992, with 963 cases reported for the entire year. We're not even halfway through 2019, and 971 cases have been reported, according to a statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. But recently, this highly contagious disease has made a comeback — in part due to non-vaccinated clusters of people. Amid the numerous measles outbreaks across the country, scientists are warning that the U.S. is moving backward on the path to elimination.

Measles outbreaks have plagued New York City and New York's Rockland County, for example, for nearly the past eight months. (The CDC defines an ""outbreak of measles"" as three or more cases.) If cases continue to climb through the summer and into the fall, the U.S. could lose its measles elimination status, according to the statement. [27 Devastating Infectious Diseases]

""That loss would be a huge blow for the nation and erase the hard work done by all levels of public health,"" the CDC wrote. Before the measles vaccine was widespread, around 3 million to 4 million people would contract measles each year, and 400 to 500 of them would die from it, according to the statement.

The advent and widespread use of the vaccine, which is highly effective, led to the elimination of measles. The most common form of the vaccine given to children, the MMR vaccine, is 97% effective in protecting against the disease, according to the CDC. (The vaccine also protects against mumps and rubella, two other viral infections.)

""Measles is preventable, and the way to end this outbreak is to ensure that all children and adults who can get vaccinated, do get vaccinated,"" said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield in the statement.

The CDC recommends that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first between the ages of 12 months and 15 months, and the second between the ages of 4 and 6. But if traveling internationally (where measles can be more rampant), everyone 6 months and older should be protected by the vaccine, according to the statement. Babies 6 to 11 months old need one dose before traveling, and anyone older should have two doses, they wrote.

""Again, I want to reassure parents that vaccines are safe, they do not cause autism,"" Redfield said. ""The greater danger is the disease the vaccination prevents."""

Iraqi officials present at the hanging say Saddam went to his death a broken man, but showed no remorse for his actions. From Iraq, VOA's Margaret Besheer has more.

Holding the Muslim holy book, the Koran, and refusing a black hood, Saddam Hussein faced the same fate many common criminals suffered during his more than 20 years as Iraq's president.

At shortly after 6 a.m., the former strongman was hanged. The execution took place at a former military intelligence headquarters in Baghdad's Shi'ite neighborhood of Kazimiyah, outside the heavily fortified Green Zone.

In video footage released on state-run al-Iraqiyah television, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki is shown signing the execution order. The video then cuts to the scene of the execution, where six masked men are escorting a calm Saddam Hussein to the gallows.

He is wearing a black coat and white shirt. They wrap a black cloth around his neck, but do not put a hood over his head. His hands are tied behind his back. Two executioners put the large rope noose around his neck. The footage ends there.

Iraqi National Security Advisor, Mouaffac al-Rubaie, who witnessed the execution, said it was completely handled by the Iraqis and no American witnesses were present.

Rubaie told Iraqiyah state television that only Saddam was executed, because they wanted to make it a special day for him. He said they chose the execution time, just before sunrise, so it would occur before the official start of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha, which marks the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca.

Initial reports said two of Saddam's lieutenants had been hanged just after him, but Rubaie said this was not the case, and that Barzan al-Tikriti and Bawad al-Bandar would be executed after the Eid holiday.

In Shi'ite neighborhoods of Baghdad, there was much jubilation and celebratory gunfire could be heard across the capital.

Reflecting the sentiments of many Iraqis, this man says he cannot describe his happiness, because for 20 years Saddam crushed his people and destroyed Iraq.

An Iraqi special tribunal condemned the former president to death on November 5 for his role in ordering the executions of 148 Shi'ite men and boys from the town of Dujail after a failed assassination attempt against him there in 1982.

At his death, Saddam was standing trial for the murders of some 180,000 Kurds during the al-Anfal campaign of the late 1980s. The trial will likely continue for his six co-defendants.

In Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, police blocked the entrances to the town and said nobody was allowed to leave or enter the city for four days. Elsewhere, Iraqi and U.S. forces remained on heightened alert over concerns of possible retaliatory attacks from Saddam loyalists and Sunni Arab extremists."

Ministers of the cartel and outside nations led by Russia met via video conference to adopt the measure, aimed at cutting the excess production depressing prices as global aviation remains largely grounded due to the pandemic. The curbed output represents some 10% of the world's overall supply.

Sri Lanka to reopen to tourists in August

Sri Lanka says it will be reopen for international tourists starting August 1 after a “successful containment” of the novel coronavirus. Its main tourism organisation said on Saturday that all precautionary measures recommended by global health and travel authorities have been put in place to keep visitors and residents safe.

Only online visa applications will be accepted and all tourists must show proof they tested negative for the virus 72 hours before arriving in Sri Lanka. Visitors also must have a confirmed travel itinerary, a return plane ticket and a travel insurance with health and hospitalization coverage.

There will be mandatory health screening and testing at the airport. Tourists will be lodged at a nearby hotel pending COVID-19 test results which would be expected within 24 hours.

Sweden has been at the centre of much debate over the past few weeks. Why has it not ruthlessly pursued lockdown like everyone else? Is it doing the right thing?

Well, the Swedes themselves seem to think so, with overwhelming support for their government’s decisions and the advice of scientists.

This is not a country divided. And we should also be clear that this is not a country that has done nothing. It has banned large gatherings, closed high schools and universities and told elderly people to self-isolate.

But restaurants, bars, primary schools and most businesses are still open. The country has forged its odd path. And in absolute terms, unfortunately, more people so far have died compared to its Nordic neighbours.

At the time of writing, Sweden has 14,777 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,580 people have died. If we compare that to Norway, which has half the population, it has seen 7,156 cases – or approximately half of that of Sweden – and the much-lower figure of 181 deaths. Finland, which has a population similar to Norway's, has seen 4,014 COVID-19 cases and 98 fatalities.

Comparably, the virus has been nearly ten times more deadly in Sweden, even though it has only twice the population. Yet, hospitals have not been overwhelmed; figures available from last week show capacity is running at 80 per cent and worst-case estimates around infection and death rates have simply not transpired.

That is not to say there isn’t anger out there, particularly at a perceived lack of shielding of older people. More than a third of fatalities have been people living in care homes.

The impact of the coronavirus cannot simply be measured by its effect on health. Unsurprisingly, Sweden has been less damaged economically. Personal spending in Denmark is down 66 per cent and in Finland it stands at 70 per cent, compared to only 30 per cent in Sweden. Unemployment claims in Norway are rising four times as fast as those in Sweden. The latter’s overall economy is not expected to slump to nearly the same degree as much of Europe.

And then there is the issue of so-called herd immunity. Studies at the weekend suggested between 25-40 per cent of Stockholm may have actually already had the virus. It could be up to 60 per cent by late May. In France, it is currently believed to stand at around six per cent.

Does this mean Sweden will be better able to stem, stop or see less of an impact from the second or third waves when they inevitably come? We honestly do not know. It isn’t an exact science at the moment, we can't predict the future. And it will be a long time before we can fully assess whether or not Sweden has got it right.

In foreshadowing an open-ended military and diplomatic offensive, secretary of state Colin Powell plainly expects unquestioning cooperation from all countries, great and small. This blunt message to all and sundry is: now we cut the crap. You are either for us or against us. We are going to win. Back us - or you, too, will lose.

These propositions demand urgent scrutiny - for despite Mr Bush's initial caution, here is the looming, daunting prospect of superpower unleashed, of Prometheus unbound. And America's friends must think hard and fast about what they are getting into. Did the world really change this week? For the American people, yes, without doubt. They discovered in the most awful fashion that they were vulnerable, en masse, to foreign enemies; and that their government could not protect them. For other nations that have long lived with terrorism, only the scale changed. But for Americans, the illusion of safety shattered. A culture of impunity in which US governments act abroad with little fear of direct consequences at home was smashed as utterly as Manhattan's doomed towers.

Is the US now justified in demanding unstinting support? Yes, but that support cannot be unthinking, too. It is incumbent upon Mr Bush to define the threat he would eradicate and the scope of the measures he might employ. The options in the shadowy world he is about to enter range from a full-scale, Gulf war-style mobilisation against Afghanistan to aerial attacks and special forces incursions. In prospect too, perhaps, is a return to Reagan era covert operations, snatch squads, secret funds, state subversion, and even political assassination. And as far as can be ascertained now, such activity may not be confined to crushing Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. This uncontained American campaign potentially leads to the very gates of Damascus, to Tehran and even more likely, to Saddam Hussein's Baghdad.

The danger that others will exploit America's war for their own purposes is also apparent. Russia, for example, says it is happy to help crush terrorists, especially the Chechen variety. Israel is already acting as if it had received a green light for intensified repression in the Occupied Territories. Pakistan, pivotal in any Afghan operation, will doubtless want a quid pro quo, perhaps over its links to Kashmiri terrorism. And what will China's price be? Silence on Tibet? In Washington, meanwhile, another woeful prospect is the predicted collapse of congressional opposition to Mr Bush's rogue-bashing missile defence plans.

That Nato, the UN, G8, and the EU have rallied to America's banner is only right. The US deserves every sympathy and should be supported in taking all reasonable measures to find and punish this week's culprits. But international institutions, like governments, have a broader duty in the dangerous days ahead to deflect and mitigate the wilder lunges of this wounded superpower. Whether they can do so, given America's present mood, will give us a first measure of Mr Bush's crusading new world."
603,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as an anti-vaccine advocate and President-elect Donald Trump as the person who asked him to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety.,True,The article discusses the action of creating a new government commission on vaccine safety.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that President-elect Donald Trump asked him to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety. But science on this issue is already clear; numerous studies show that vaccines are safe and effective, and that serious side effects are rare.

On Tuesday (Jan. 10), Kennedy met with the president-elect at Trump Tower, and later told reporters about the new commission. However, the Trump administration did not confirm that such a commission was in the works. A spokesperson for Trump said only that the president-elect was ""exploring the possibility of forming a committee on autism,"" according to The New York Times. This response may reference the proposed, but discredited link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Members of the medical community quickly expressed strong concerns about the possibility of a government committee on vaccine safety, headed by an anti-vaccine advocate.

""Claims that vaccines are linked to autism or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature,"" Dr. Fernando Stein, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and Dr. Karen Remley, executive vice president of the AAP, said in a statement. ""Vaccines are safe. Vaccines are effective. Vaccines save lives,"" the statement said.

But how do doctors know this?

First, the United States requires that all vaccines undergo extensive testing on safety and effectiveness before they can be brought to market, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And once vaccines are on the market, there are several systems in place to monitor the safety of the treatments within the general population. [5 Dangerous Vaccination Myths]

These studies do show that, like all medicines, vaccines come with a small risk of side effects, but these side effects are rarely serious. What's more, the alternative of not vaccinating a child also comes with risks, because vaccines prevent diseases that can be dangerous and sometimes fatal, the CDC said. For each approved vaccine, researchers have determined that the benefits outweigh the risks.

Here's a look at some of the data behind vaccine safety and effectiveness:
• Over the past two decades, childhood vaccines have saved the lives of 732,000 U.S. children and prevented more than 300 million kids from getting sick, according to a 2014 study from the CDC.
• Nearly 90 percent of vaccine side effects are not serious, according to the CDC.
• More than 20 rigorous scientific studies have shown that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism, according to the CDC. The original study that claimed to find such a link has been discredited, and was retracted.
• A 2011 report from the National Academy of Medicine reviewed more than 1,000 vaccine studies and concluded that serious reactions to vaccines are extremely rare.
• The MMR vaccine can cause fevers, and some children who develop a fever can have a seizure; these are called fever-triggered seizures. However, studies show there is one case of fever-triggered seizure for every 3,000 to 4,000 children who receive this vaccine. And these seizures almost never cause harm over the long term, the 2011 review said.
• About one in 10 children who is infected with measles develops an ear infection, and such infections can result in permanent hearing loss, according to the CDC.
• For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from the disease, the CDC said.
• Two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles, the CDC said.
• In rare cases, the rotavirus vaccine, called RotaTeq, is linked to the development of a serious intestinal disorder called intussusception. A 2014 study found that for every 65,000 children who received this vaccine, there was one case of intussusception.
• A 2011 study found that the rotavirus vaccine had prevented 65,000 U.S. children from being hospitalized with rotavirus since 2006.
• A 2012 study found that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is linked with an increased risk of fainting. The study, which included nearly 200,000 girls who received at least one dose of the Gardasil HPV vaccine, found that there were 24 cases of fainting per 1,000 people on the day of vaccination. For comparison, there were an average of four cases of fainting per 1,000 people when studied months after vaccination.
• The HPV vaccine was introduced in 2006, and during the next four years, the rate of HPV infections among teen girls decreased by 56 percent, despite a relatively low vaccination rate in this age group, according to a 2013 study. (HPV infections in women increase the risk of cervical cancer.)
• Studies on the safety of the chicken-pox vaccine found that about 3 percent of children had a mild, chicken-pox-like rash after the first dose of the vaccine, according to the CDC. On average, these children had two to five lesions, compared with the typical 250 to 500 lesions found in children who contract the actual illness, according to the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC), a nonprofit organization funded by the CDC that creates and distributes educational materials on vaccines.
• Although chicken pox is usually a mild disease, it can cause serious complications, including bacterial infections of the skin, pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and blood stream infections, according to the CDC. Before the introduction of the chicken pox vaccine, there were about 4 million cases of chicken pox in the United States per year, and of these, an estimated 11,000 people went to the hospital with complications and 100 people died from the disease, the IAC said.
• After the introduction of the chicken pox vaccine, cases of the disease fell nearly 80 percent in the U.S. over a decade, according to a 2012 study."

605,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions Barack Obama, Russian government officials, Russian programmer Alisa Shevchenko, the GRU (Russian military intelligence services), and the FSB (Russian secret service agencies).",True,"The article mentions Barack Obama retaliating against alleged Russian interference, expelling Russian government officials, placing sanctions on Russian security agencies, companies, and individuals.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article discusses the evidence presented to tie Russian intelligence services with the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"As one of his parting acts as US President, Barack Obama retaliated against alleged Russian interference in the recent US election by expelling 35 Russian government officials from the US and placing sanctions on Russian security agencies, 3 companies and several individuals.

One of the companies included on the sanctions list was Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) which was set up by a Russian programmer Alisa Shevchenko. According to the White House, Zorsecurity was included because it had provided the GRU (one of Russia’s military intelligence services) “with technical research and development”.

And that was it. Except that Shevchenko has vehemently denied that she has worked for the Russian government stating that “We don’t make malware for the Russian government”.

The difficulty for Shevchenko is that she simply doesn’t know what being placed on a sanctions list means for her personally. To be clear, there was no trial, no evidence presented publicly, nor was there an opportunity to provide a defence, there was simply an accusation and a listing on a public announcement.

What makes this particularly frustrating for Shevchenko is that the company listed doesn’t actually trade any more and so from one perspective the entire matter is moot.

It seems extraordinary that high stakes response to the Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin should have on the one hand two of Russia’s secret service agencies, the FSB and GRU and on the other hand a defunct company run at one time by a solitary Russian hacker with a handful of employees.

It has been argued that the evidence put forward to tie the Russian intelligence services with the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was not definitive enough to prove the link. Evidence for Russian involvement comes essentially from comparing the malware and techniques used by the hackers to previous hacks believed to be by specific groups, in this case from two groups called APT 28 (Aka Fancy Bear) and APT 29 (Aka Cozy Bear). These groups in turn are thought to be associated with the GRU (APT 28) and FSB (APT 29).

Whilst the debate continues of whether the evidence presented is actually sufficient to definitively tie specific groups to the hack, none of the evidence presented ties in with Shevchenko and Zorsecurity.

Shevchenko’s situation highlights the perils of being associated with cybersecurity even if you are one of the good guys, the so-called “White Hat” hackers. She is a self-taught and talented programmer who specialises in finding “zero-day” exploits. Whilst these exploits can, and are, used by criminals and spies, they can also be used to probe weaknesses in corporate networks as part of what is called penetration testing. In fact, Shevchenko has publicly contributed to finding and reporting vulnerabilities in energy management software and Microsoft Windows.

It is possible that some of her software or exploits were used by the GRU and FSB (and others) in gaining access to the DNC and other targets, however that is a different matter to her, or the company actively working with these agencies. Given the large number of companies and people who could potentially be involved with hacking on behalf the Russian services, it seems gratuitous that the US would single out a solitary female hacker to shoulder the entire blame.

The irony here is that in his rush to publicly be seen to respond to Russian hacking, Obama has sought to punish a female programmer working in cybersecurity. A key tenant of his presidency was to try and boost the participation of women in the tech industry with his own secret service agency the NSA employing hackers in their ongoing struggle to recruit real talent.

Not only is Shevchenko in a minority of women working in this area of programming but she has been extremely active in engaging in conferences and the open source community to develop and contribute software, knowledge and expertise. Alisa Shevchenko was also one of the founders of a community “hack space” Neuron Hackspace. None of this particularly suggested an idealogue dedicated to the hacking of the DNC.

Inadvertently perhaps, Obama has sent a clear message of the dangers for cybersecurity experts in becoming collateral damage in the political battles between the US, Russia and China. Just possibly, he has also just reinforced the extra dangers for women who stand out from the crowd?

In an additional irony, it may be that incoming US President Donald Trump will come to Shevchenko’s aid. He has indicated that he may reverse Obama’s sanctions against the Russians, especially if the Russians collaborate with the US against terrorism."

Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahhaf appeared on Iraqi television Saturday and read a letter from Saddam to Iraq's neighbour.

""We apologize to God for any act that has angered Him in the past and that has been held against us, and we apologize to you (the Kuwaitis) on the same basis,"" one translation of the letter read.

Saddam said he was apologizing to set the record straight, not out of weakness.

""Brother, what we wish for you is the same as we endeavour to do for your brothers in Iraq namely, for you to live free without foreigners controlling your destiny, will, decisions, wealth, present and future...""

Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, a move that sparked the Gulf War, ending when U.S.-led forces drove the Iraqi army out in Februrary 1991.

The U.S. military is currently using Kuwait as a base for training exercises, something the Iraqi government spoke out against Saturday. It claims Kuwait is now under military occupation by the roughly 12,000 American soldiers in the country.

The statement urged ""the holy warriors in Kuwait"" to meet with their counterparts in Iraq, not to align themselves with London or Washington and to fight ""against the occupation of infidel armies.""

Kuwait dismissed Saddam's statement as nothing more than an attempt to bully the country into ending ties with Washington.

""Regrettably, the speech contained words to which we would rather not stoop and respond,"" Information Minister Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah told the Kuwait News Agency late Saturday night.

""He must apologize to the Iraqi people first for dragging them into wars that wasted their resources and apologize to the State of Kuwait by telling the truth and returning the prisoners (captured during the 1990 invasion).""

As-Sabah said Saddam's sole purpose was to build up opposition to the United States.

""This is a speech aimed at inciting Kuwaitis to attack Americans and at threatening Kuwait for co-operating with America,"" he said. ""The speech contained incitement and encouragement of terrorist acts which the whole world has rejected and condemned."""

While it’s not being said that Clint Eastwood made President Obama’s day, the chief executive does own up to being “a huge fan” of the actor-filmmaker – who last week delivered a long and much-discussed prime-time presentation on stage at the Republican National Convention that was critical of the current administration.

“He is a great actor, and an even better director,” the President told USA Today in an interview aboard Air Force One. “I think the last few movies that he’s made have been terrific.”

The newspaper then asked point blank if Obama took offense at what Eastwood did – speaking to an empty chair that was meant to represent Obama’s sitting there and responding to the screen legend’s pointed questions.

“One thing about being president or running for president,” replied Obama, “if you’re easily offended, you should probably choose another profession.”

Soon after Eastwood’s televised appearance at the RNC in Tampa, Obama’s campaign staff took to its Twitter account to fire back at Eastwood and his empty chair symbol. The message, accompanied by a photo of the presidential chair with Obama sitting in it: “This seat’s taken.”

In many cases, a routine vaccination is missed due to ignorance or inadequate health care. Vaccination rates for children on Medicaid hover below those of private health plans by several percentage points, according to the NCQA.

But some parents are purposely avoiding vaccinations, opting for a ""philosophical exemption"" to excuse their child from school immunization requirements, said Jeffrey Dimond of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They point to rumors littering the Internet that suggest shots can make children autistic or otherwise chronically ill.

Here are five myths about vaccines, and the truth behind them.

The only disease that has been eradicated is small pox. Everything else is still out there. Some like whooping cough and measles continue to cause disease in the developed world. Others, such as polio, mainly occur in developing nations, but could be reintroduced anywhere, via international travel.

Myth: Children get too many shots

Myth: Children get too many shots, too early.

Vaccines are a trivial challenge to what children typically encounter and manage every day, said Paul Offit, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Their bodies constantly face things in their environment that challenge their immune systems to work hard, such as bacteria that line our skin, nose, throat and intestines, as well as bacteria in food, water and the air.

Immunologists at the University of California, San Diego looked into the number of immunological challenges a person can respond to at one time. After considering the variety of compounds in vaccines, including bacterial proteins, bacterial polysaccharides and viral proteins, Offit explained, they calculated that young children could safely respond to as many as 100,000 vaccines at once. The CDC recommends children get vaccinated against 14 diseases over a two-year period.

Myth: The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism.

This myth started in 1998, when a study authored by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and colleagues was published in the journal The Lancet. The study followed 12 children, eight of whom had parents who believed their child's behavioral problems were caused by the MMR vaccine. The study set off a panic, causing vaccination results to drop and rates of measles to skyrocket. Earlier this year, the editors of the Lancet officially retracted the paper, citing evidence that it held false information.

Many other studies, including ones published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the British Medical Journal, have shown the increase in autism rates is not linked to the MMR vaccine. One of the largest long-term studies was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002. Following 537,000 children, it found the rates of autism were the same among kids who had been vaccinated and those that had not.

After extensive reviews, the Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization and other major medical authorities have all concluded the same thing: The MMR vaccine is not causing the rise in autism .

This one is true, but walking down the street is not 100-percent safe either, and that doesn't stop pedestrian traffic. Almost all vaccines are given via shots, which can cause pain, redness and tenderness at the injection site. Other rare side effects include fever, persistent crying and allergic reactions .

Even more rarely, serious complications can occur. For example, the old, now-discontinued rotavirus vaccine was tied to a slight increase in intussusception, a bowel blockage problem. Out of the one million children given this vaccine between 1998 and 1999, roughly one hundred suffered this complication and one died. (Today's rotavirus vaccines have not been linked to this problem.)

Going without a vaccine is not safe either. The most prevalent cause of severe diarrhea, rotavirus kills 20 to 100 children every year in the United States and hospitalizes 55,000 to 100,000, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Worldwide, 3 million children are estimated to die from rotavirus each year.

Because some vaccines have been around for over 50 years, most young parents aren't familiar with the diseases they are preventing. But vaccines are often thanklessly still hard at work.

For example, before the vaccine became available in 1963, almost everyone contracted measles before the age of 15. In the United States, it killed 450 people, mostly children, on average every year. After the vaccine was introduced, cases of measles reached a low of 37 in 2004. But just two years ago, that number climbed more than 130, according to the CDC; many of the patients were unvaccinated by choice.

In England and Wales, according to the Health Protection Agency, a similar trend of vaccination avoidance caused cases of measles to climb from 56 in 1998 to 1348 cases in 2008. Measles is now considered to have officially returned to the area as an endemic disease."

To expand upon previous decisions, all travel that has been scheduled through December 31, 2020, must be canceled (see cancellation guidelines.) Exemption processes and elevated approvals related to travel restriction are available under specific circumstances.

The university has also taken the difficult step of canceling all education abroad programs for the autumn semester. We look forward to students returning to these important teaching-and-learning experiences once it is advisable to do so. We will continue to monitor guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and others.

The university will periodically reassess the opportunity for travel as appropriate to public health. Details of the restrictions include:
• These restrictions apply to university-sponsored travel (via flight, train or vehicle) for students, faculty, staff, guests and recruits.
• All international and domestic travel (including driving within the state of Ohio) must be canceled and an exemption process will be limited to business essential travel and will be approved on a case-by-case basis.
• Business essential travel is defined as travel that is absolutely necessary to the mission of the university, cannot be conducted via virtual platforms and does not create an unacceptable health hazard. Conference attendance and presentations are not generally considered essential travel.

We recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating and are committed to keeping you informed and up to date as this situation evolves. The status of this extension to December 31 will continue to be monitored based on COVID-19 travel guidelines issued by the State of Ohio and CDC travel risk assessments.

American censors took exception to parts of the film, specifically scenes featuring sodomy between Saddam Hussein and Satan. Consequently, the film was substantially cut, and was given an R certificate, meaning those under the age of 17 have to be accompanied by an adult.

A Christian website, crosstalk.com, describes the film as “intentionally immoral, with the most vile content in the history of mainstream movie-making; 340 counted obscenities… 14 profanities and many disgusting bodily functions, including vomiting, bloody violence… extreme sex including homosexuality and paedophilia… this is a blasphemous, evil movie. EVIL.”

In the UK, the film has been granted a 15 certificate, allowing anyone over that age to see it unaccompanied, and not a frame was chopped.

A spokesman for the BBFC explained: “You can’t really generalise, but the Americans are very strict about sexual material above all else. We didn’t have a problem with anything in the film.”

Ironically, the film’s full title is South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut and pokes fun at the hypocrisy of most censorship regarding war, violence and sex.

Trey Parker, who together with Matt Stone create South Park, hit out at the current “climate of fear” in the wake of the Columbine massacre and the hypocrisy of the US censors, he declared: “It’s just scary – going through the trailer process and getting the notes back (from the censors) that say, ‘You just can’t fart.’ It’s like, the shot of the guy shooting the M60 and all these people getting shot – that was OK. But the guy farting has to go.”

As US President Donald Trump came under increasing fire for ordering a freeze on American funding for the World Health Organization, the Group of 20 (G20) announced a one-year debt moratorium for the world's poorest nations.

The number of COVID-19 cases around the globe soared past two million, meanwhile, according to an AFP tally, and the death toll topped 131,000.

Germany was the largest of several European countries announcing tentative steps on Wednesday to reopen their economies and societies.

Denmark began reopening schools for younger children after a month-long closure and Finland lifted a two-week rail and road blockade on the Helsinki region.

Lithuania said it would allow smaller shops to reopen from Thursday.

Other countries are also tweaking confinement rules, with Iran set to let some small businesses reopen and India allowing millions of rural people to return to work.

In South Korea, people went to the polls on Wednesday and delivered a strong show of support for President Moon Jae-in, commending his handling of the epidemic.

Once home to the world's second-largest outbreak, South Korea has largely brought the virus under control through widespread testing, contact-tracing and social distancing.

Yet a full-scale return to normality still appears a long way off in most other countries.

Harvard scientists have warned that repeated periods of social distancing could be needed as far ahead as 2022 to avoid overwhelming hospitals.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has allowed work to restart in some factories and building sites, warned that ""nothing will be the same until a vaccine is found.""

Belgium extended its stay-at-home order until at least May 3 and banned mass gatherings until the end of August.

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced first steps in undoing coronavirus restrictions that have plunged the economy into a recession.

Most shops will be allowed to open once they have ""plans to maintain hygiene"" although schools must stay closed until May 4 and a ban on large public events will remain in place until August 31.

""We have to proceed with extreme caution,"" Merkel told reporters in Berlin.

Schools will gradually be reopened with priority given to pupils about to take leaving examinations.

And the government urged people to wear face masks when out shopping or on public transport, but stopped short of making it a requirement like in neighbouring Austria.

Offering a lifeline for the world's poorest countries, the G20 -- a group of the world's leading economies -- said it would temporarily suspend debt repayments from the most impoverished nations.

The reprieve will free up more than $20 billion for those countries to focus on the pandemic and will last at least a year, according to Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan.

But the global economic outlook remains gloomy, with Germany already in recession and US industrial output declining by 6.3 percent -- its biggest fall in seven decades.

More than a third of French workers are on temporary unemployment, the government said.

The virus death toll topped 17,000 in France but in a hopeful sign hospitalizations went down for the first time.

On the horizon looms the worst economic downturn in a century, which the IMF has said could see $9 trillion wiped from the global economy.

As the world tries to chart a way out of the crisis, Trump came in for criticism for his freeze on payments to the WHO, the UN's health agency.

""No doubt, areas for improvement will be identified and there will be lessons for all of us to learn,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

UN chief Antonio Guterres condemned Trump's move while billionaire Bill Gates, a major WHO contributor, tweeted that cutting funding was ""as dangerous as it sounds.""

European allies were similarly disapproving and Washington's rivals also took aim -- Russia condemning the ""selfish approach"" of the US, and China and Iran blasting the decision.

Trump accused the WHO on Tuesday of ""severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus"" and said it could have been contained if the organisation had accurately assessed the situation in China late last year.

As European nations made tentative moves to open up, in poorer and more densely populated countries, governments are still struggling to enforce restrictions on movement that are piling misery on the needy.

Fears over hunger and possible social unrest are especially acute in parts of Africa and Latin America.

In Cape Town, clashes erupted Tuesday as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at residents protesting access to food aid.

A similar crisis is taking hold in Ecuador, where hunger trumps fear of the virus for residents in rundown areas of the badly affected city of Guayaquil.

""The police come with a whip to send people running, but how do you say to a poor person 'Stay home' if you don't have enough to eat?"" said Carlos Valencia, a 35-year-old teacher."

While congressional oversight committees got some briefings during the U.S.-backed Contra wars of the 1980s, ``CIA did not inform Congress of all allegations″ linking Contras to drug trafficking, the CIA Inspector General L. Britt Snider concluded.

``No information has been found to indicate that any U.S. law enforcement entity or executive branch agency was informed by CIA of drug trafficking allegations″ concerning 11 Contra-related individuals who worked with the CIA, the report said.

The 410-page declassified version of the report, posted on the CIA’s Web site late Thursday, provides new insights into U.S. intelligence during the Reagan years as it aided the anti-Communist Nicaraguan Contra forces. Throughout those years, House and Senate Democrats _ then the majority party in Congress _ regularly questioned the CIA about persistent rumors that the Contras were trafficking in narcotics to finance their effort to overthrow the Sandinista government.

In classified briefings on Capitol Hill, CIA officials typically acknowledged only one major case of narcotics involvement by an anti-Sandinista group _ the so-called ADREN 15th of September group, which had been disbanded in 1982. But the newly declassified report links to drug allegations 58 other individuals belonging to various Contra groups.

For example, the CIA had information linking 14 pilots and two other individuals involved in transport to drug trafficking. In 1984, the CIA broke off contact with one member of the Contra Sandino Revolutionary Front linked to known drug trafficker Jorge Morales but ``continued to have contact through 1986-87 with four of the (other) individuals involved with Morales,″ the report said.

In the fall of 1986 and all of 1987, Congress prohibited the Reagan administration from funding any Contra group with members known to be involved in drug smuggling. In response, the IG report says, the CIA did not investigate such allegations and thus avoided invoking the funding cutoff.

At a time when CIA files contained numerous cases of suspected drug trafficking by Contra-connected individuals, Alan Fiers, then chief of the CIA’s Central American Task Force, was telling the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1987, ``We have uncovered no indications that any of these individuals are involved or have been involved in narcotics trafficking.″

In 1988, Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., were pressuring John Helgerson, the CIA’s chief liaison to Congress, to produce information on alleged Contra drug activity. In a memo to senior CIA officials, Helgerson wrote, ``Realistically, we are likely to have to respond somehow _ fairly quickly _ to the Kerry and Pell requests regarding when we knew what.″ But Helgerson advised against passing on ``raw reporting or operational traffic″ to the lawmakers.

The CIA apparently had allies on the Senate Intelligence Committee who ``were not ‘taken’ with the topic and were very frustrated by the tasking from Senators Kerry and Pell,″ the IG report said. Current CIA Director George Tenet and Inspector General Snider were then on the committee’s staff.

Then-acting CIA Director Robert Gates did try to get tough regarding contacts with drug traffickers. The IG report describes an April 9, 1987, memo from Gates to his operations chief, Clair George. Gates said it was ``absolutely imperative″ that the CIA and its Central American operatives ``avoid any kind of involvement with individuals or companies that are even suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking.″ Apparently the memo never made it past George.

``No information has been found to indicate that this memorandum, in its entirety, was disseminated to anyone at CIA headquarters other than DDO George,″ the report states.

This IG report grew out of a CIA inquiry following a newspaper series that alleged a connection between the agency and Contra-connected crack cocaine dealers. The CIA has disavowed any such connection, and the inspector general did as well in an earlier report."

Long-standing US domestic and foreign policies, such as a commitment to free trade and membership of Nato, all face an overhaul.

But events have moved fast. Here's how Mr Trump's incoming presidency has already changed the world.

The final days of the Obama administration might have been very different, with the outgoing president handing over safe in the knowledge that his signature policies will be protected by another Democrat.

Instead, his administration has gone on the defensive, scrambling to protect his legacy, laying down what Mr Trump has called ""roadblocks"".

There have been sanctions against Russians, a ban on offshore energy drilling, a refusal to veto a UN call to end Israeli settlements and a last-minute rush of deals with Cuba.

All of these conflict with pronouncements made by Mr Trump, and could at the very least make life more difficult for the president-elect.

The campaign was dogged by baseless stories shared on social media, from a claim that actor Denzel Washington had endorsed Mr Trump (he didn't) to the notorious ""pizzagate"" conspiracy.

After criticism from users, arguably the key gatekeeper, Facebook, announced measures to tackle the problem of fake news.

The higher-than-high stakes election did more than anything to highlight the problem, and America was not the only country affected. In Italy, for instance, there were concerns fake news had influenced last month's constitutional referendum.

Social media giants face a tricky 2017, trying to balance the freedom enjoyed by their users with a new, unfamiliar role as arbiter-in-chief, perhaps assuming an even bigger role in our lives.

World stock markets have enjoyed a strong run since Mr Trump's election, thanks, analysts say, to investors' belief he will boost infrastructure and cut taxes when in office.

Mr Trump promised to be the ""greatest jobs president that God ever created"" and has taken credit for a slew of company announcements.

But while the Donald may giveth, the Donald can also taketh away.

Companies, whole sectors even, have seen share prices rattled by Mr Trump, with some traders reportedly adapting their algorithms to respond instantly to his tweets.

Pharmaceutical firms, for instance, were hit during a press conference when Mr Trump said they were ""getting away with murder"".

Trump on Twitter: A history of the man and his medium

Some of Mr Trump's angriest rhetoric has been directed at China. Beijing was infuriated by a phone call he took from Taiwan's leader, in defiance of the ""One China"" policy.

But while Mr Trump seems to be squaring up to China, could China see a Trump presidency as an opportunity?

Xi Jinping became the first Chinese president to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he defended globalisation, a pointed rebuke to Mr Trump's attacks on free trade.

China has been stepping up its economic leadership, pushing an expanded free trade area in the Asia-Pacific region.

And it could position itself as a leader on climate change, too, with the country's Vice-Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin saying it was no Chinese hoax, and that a change in US policy would not affect Beijing's commitment to the issue.

Diversity on the up

Hillary Clinton may have missed her chance to become the first female US president, but could a Trump presidency spur other women to shatter that ultimate glass ceiling?

Several groups dedicated to getting more women into politics have seen a surge in new members and donations.

The election was ""the kick in the pants that I needed"", as one woman now hoping to run for office put it.

And while the US has a disproportionately low number of women in politics, this already seems to be changing with the largest number yet elected to Congress in 2017.

Mr Trump had no shortage of detractors during the election, be they foreign powers, business leaders or members of his own party.

But it didn't take long for them to come around. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who all but disowned Mr Trump in the campaign, pledged on election night to work ""hand-in-hand"" with the next US leader.

UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson once declared Donald Trump ""unfit"" to hold the presidency, before calling for an end to the ""whinge-o-rama"" over his win.

Tech leaders, many of whom had railed against Mr Trump, ended up meeting him at Trump Tower.

Perhaps refusing to work with the new president simply is not an option.

But are his new fans meeting him on common ground, or has Mr Trump dragged the US - and the rest of the world - to uncharted territory?"

The European Central Bank just announced it will be expanding its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion and kept interest rates unchanged. This is €100 billion more than investors were expecting. The duration of PEPP has also been extended to at least the end of June 2021 and purchases will continue ""until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over."" The central bank has ramped up its other bond-buying programs and usual lending to banks by €630 billion since March, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics﻿﻿.

The European Central Bank also said headline inflation was expected to be 0.3% in 2020 and 0.8% in 2021 — well below the bank’s mandate to drive inflation “close but below 2%”. GDP is expected to decline by 8.7% this year, before rebounding to 5.2% growth in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022. ECB President Lagarde last week ruled out the ""mild"" scenario (5% GDP decline) for 2020 and said we're likely to see output reduce according to the ""medium"" or ""severe"" scenarios (8-12% decline).

The pandemic poses a unique threat to the European Union and the Eurozone. A recovery fund proposed by the executive branch of the EU is being opposed by certain less-affected, ""frugal"" countries that don't want to share debt or give grants to the needy ones instead of loans. The ECB's bond-buying program faced flak from Germany's highest court last month. It demanded that the German government and central bank force the ECB to prove it is necessary and does not violate the principle of proportionality (weighing the costs and benefits). While it has no jurisdiction over the ECB, the court can affect the Bundesbank's participation. It can also inspire other nation's judiciaries in the euro area to question the ECB's credibility in a similar way.

Brexit trade talks aren't going so well. The two regions have until the end of the year to strike a new deal, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to extend the deadline. According to Germany’s ambassador to the EU, Michael Clauss, negotiators have made ""no real progress."" ""Is a deal possible? Yes, definitely,"" he said at a European Policy Centre event yesterday. ""But I think it also means that the U.K. needs to have a more realistic approach. To put it short: I think we cannot have full sovereignty and at the same time full access to the internal market. So this Brexit issue is going to absorb a lot of political or most of the political attention we expect in September and October."" A current big issue being discussed is fish quota i.e. whether European companies can access U.K. waters to fish."

The government received a boost with the arrival in Baghdad of five Sukhoi 25 warplanes purchased second-hand from Russia. The aircraft is designed to provide close air support to ground forces and to destroy mobile targets.

Iraqi air force commander Anwar Hama Amin said the military is ""in urgent need of this type of aircraft during this difficult time"".

""These jets will enter service within a few days - the coming three or four days - in order to support the units and to fight the terrorist ISIL organisation,"" he said, referring to the al Qaida breakaway Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which has spearheaded the Sunni militant offensive.

The planes could be deployed in the fight for Tikrit, a predominantly Sunni city of more than 200,000 some 80 miles north of Baghdad where anger towards Iraq's Shiite-led government runs deep.

There were conflicting reports as to how far the military advanced in its initial thrust toward the northern city. Residents said militants were still in control of the city by nightfall yesterday while Iraqi security officials said troops had reached the outskirts and the provincial governor said they had pushed into the city itself.

The government has presented the campaign as a rebound following weeks of demoralising defeats at the hands of insurgents. The militants' surge across much of northern and western Iraq has thrown the country into its deepest crisis since US troops withdrew in December 2011, and threatens to cleave the nation in three along sectarian and ethnic lines.

If successful, the Tikrit operation could help restore a degree of faith in the security forces - as well as embattled Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who is fighting to keep his job.

Yesterday's fighting began before dawn with helicopter gunships carrying out airstrikes on insurgents who were attacking troops at a university campus on Tikrit's northern outskirts, Iraqi military spokesman Qassim al-Moussawi said. The government forces had established a bridgehead on the university's sprawling grounds after being airlifted in the previous day.

Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day at the university. At the same time, several columns of troops pushed north toward Tikrit from Samarra, a city along the banks of the Tigris River and home to an important Shiite shrine.

By sundown, Ahmed Abu Ragheef, a commander in the Salahuddin Operational Command, said a column of troops had reached the edge of Tikrit, while another had secured an air base that previously served as a US military facility known as Camp Speicher.

The governor of Salahuddin province, Ahmed Abdullah al-Jabouri, told The Associated Press that troops pushed into Tikrit itself, reaching the provincial council building.

However, residents reached by telephone said militants were still in control of Tikrit and patrolling the city's streets.

They confirmed the clashes around the university, and reported fighting between the Islamic State and Iraqi forces to the south east of the city as well. Some residents described black smoke rising from a presidential palace complex located along the edge of the Tigris River after army helicopters opened fire on the compound."

A troubling new report from UNICEF finds that 2.5 million children in the United States and 169 million children worldwide missed out on their first dose between 2010 and 2017.

This gap in protective coverage has triggered measles outbreaks around the globe, from high-income countries in the Americas and Europe to low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa.

As a result, in 2017, measles killed 110,000 people globally, mostly children, according to the UNICEF report. That's up 22% from the year before.

""If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries,"" Henrietta Fore, UNICEF's executive director, said in a news release.

The analysis is based on UNICEF and the World Health Organization's estimate of national immunization coverage of 194 countries for 2017.

The report says lack of access to vaccines, poor health systems, complacency and fear of vaccines have all contributed to the problem.

. ""We risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating but entirely preventable disease."" ""The resurgence of measles is of serious concern, with extended outbreaks occurring across regions, and particularly in countries that had achieved, or were close to achieving measles elimination,"" Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, deputy director general for programmes at WHO, said in a recent news release ""We risk losing decades of progress in protecting children and communities against this devastating but entirely preventable disease.""

Globally, coverage of the first dose of the measles vaccine was 85% -- far short of the 95% needed prevent outbreaks and make communities immune to the disease. Global coverage for the second dose was even lower, just 67%.

In 2017, Nigeria had the highest number of children under age 1 who missed their first vaccine dose. India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Ethiopia followed. These five countries accounted for about half of the children worldwide who missed their first dose, about 10.4 million children in total.

recommended at age 12 months in most cases. In countries where measles mortality is high, WHO recommends the first dose be given at 9 months of age. In countries where the risk of infection among infants is lower, such as the United States, the first dose isat age 12 months in most cases.

The situation was better but still problematic in high-income countries such as the United States, France and the UK. Coverage for the first dose of vaccine was 94% and 91% for the second dose, according to the latest data.

Among high-income countries, the United States topped the list of children not vaccinated with the first dose.

As of this week, measles cases in the United States for this year reached the greatest number since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Experts blame the rise on misinformation about the virus and the vaccine that has led some parents to refuse to vaccinate their children.

""The anti-vaccine lobby has been telling parents that children are getting injured from vaccines or they're getting autism. We know none of those things are true,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

The UNICEF report noted the global measles crisis has continued into 2019. From January to March, provisional estimates show more than 100,000 measles cases were reported worldwide -- a 300% increase from the same period just one year ago.

UNICEF said efforts are underway to address the situation, including procuring more vaccines and helping countries identify unreached children.

""Existing strategies need to change: more effort needs to go into increasing routine immunization coverage and strengthening health systems,"" Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the global vaccine alliance Gavi, said in a WHO news release. ""Otherwise we will continue chasing one outbreak after another."""

The story has been corrected.

The decision by states to end lockdowns on their populations will inevitably lead to a spread of the coronavirus and more deaths, experts said Sunday.

Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, said their model now forecasts 137,184 deaths. That’s up from the 134,475 deaths projected on May 4.

Murray said the slight increase was due to cases and deaths going up more than expected in Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California. These increases were partially offset by better news from New Jersey and New York.

There is also an “explosive increase in mobility in a number of states that we expect will translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now,” Murray said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.

Jeffrey Shaman, professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, agreed there would be a “rebound” in cases as a result of the patchwork response from federal and state officials.

In an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Shaman said that, while it is difficult to be precise about the likely rise in cases, “one would imagine that with any loosening of restrictions there is only going to accelerate the growth of the virus.”

People who get infected today aren’t seen as confirmed cases for a couple weeks. So the growth of cases won’t be seen until the end of May, Shaman said.

“In a lot of the states in which they are loosening restrictions — they are barely hanging on. In some of them, they already have growth of the virus taking place,” he added.

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said 60% or 70% of the public will ultimately be infected by the virus. At the moment, only 5% to 15% of the population has been infected. “That is what we need a plan for,” he said.

“We are riding this tiger,” Osterholm said. “We are not directing it.” Governments can only nibble around the edges.

Osterholm said testing equipment across the country is already being run 24 hours a day and is starting to break down.

“The infrastructure is just not there,” he said. “We need a plan.”"

Half of the randomly-selected patients will receive prayers from five religious denominations: Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. According to NPR, the study will measure progress by monitoring individual patients’ organ heath, need for ventilators, and how many live.

Lakkireddy said that members of his research team “all believe in science” before going on to expound extensively on their faith: “If there is a supernatural power, which a lot of us believe, would that power of prayer and divine intervention change the outcomes in a concerted fashion? That was our question.”

“It has to be a true supernatural intervention,” he said.

Lakkireddy, who says he was “born into Hinduism,” continued, “I believe in the power of all religions. I think if we believe in the wonders of God and the universal good of any religion, then we’ve got to combine hands and join the forces of each of these faiths together for the single cause of saving humanity from this pandemic.”

According to a 2006 study published in the American Heart Journal that looked at the efficacy of prayer to heal, Lakkireddy may be in for a letdown. The study, which the New York Times called “the most scientifically rigorous investigation of whether prayer can heal illness” included 1,800 patients and showed that “prayers offered by strangers had no effect on the recovery of people who were undergoing heart surgery.”

But as Lakkireddy said about his Hail Mary attempt, “A miracle could happen. There’s always hope, right?”"

What unites it is paranoia, a sense of others controlling you, of conspiracy theories and government plots, of illegitimate government and its agents of control:

Loughner had very incoherent, hard to classify beliefs. But they were clearly paranoid and conspiratorial.

The conspiratorial or paranoid style is very much alive in our political discourse. Naturally, it's not just a right-wing phenomenon. I live in Berkeley where a fraction of people sincerely think 9-11 was an ""inside job"" pulled off by the ""Bush Regime"". There's also the ChemTrail crowd that thought the Republican government used planes to dump toxins on liberal areas to make us sick, disrupt pregnancies, and sap our will to resist. Etc., etc., So yeah, that paranoid style is alive on the fringes of the American left.

But with the Right, it's a bit different. The paranoid and conspiratorial style is much more mainstream, especially with Beck and Fox. On Fox, there are shadowy links between Soros, the Tides Foundation, and other liberal causes that aim to bring America down. Obama is at once fascist and a socialist. Don't forget Palin's dark insinuations about Obama's ties with terrorists and HCR's agenda to impose of Death Panels. Of course, you have questions about Obama birth certificate sadly mainstream when Republican representatives and candidates claim it's still an issue."

His pronouncement that the country’s current lack of water is part of a plot by Western countries has caused much amusement in some quarters.

There is no doubt that Iran is suffering from a lack of water. Three quarters of the country is drought-affected and duststorms are a frequent occurrence. Critics of Ahmadinejad’s government claim that the shortage of drinking water is the result of mismanagement of water distribution system and some two-thirds of available water is lost through wastage.

The President, however, is pointing a finger at the West. To be fair, this is a message he was issuing as early as May this year. So could there be an element of truth in his claims?

Although Mr Ahmadinejad is the son of a blacksmith, he was, until his appointment as Major of Tehran, a lecturer at the city’s University of Science and Technology, holding a PhD in traffic and transport. So he does have enough of a background in science to make his comments worthy of consideration.

Weather modification does have a long history. As early as 1947 the U.S. military was attempting to divert the course of hurricanes by seeding clouds with silver iodide. At the same time, the British were attempting to keep runways at military airfields clear by the use of long lines of burners, with the view to clearing any thick fog which had formed.

As recently as 2009, Chinese meteorologists claimed to have brought about Beijing’s earliest snowfall in a decade after seeding clouds with silver iodide in an attempt to end the ongoing drought. The resultant disruption to road and rail transport suggests that snow was probably not the objective of the experiment – a good soaking of rain was what they were really hoping for.

The problem with weather modification is whether it can be proved that the weather was indeed modified or whether it had occurred naturally.

It is likely that Mr Ahmadinejad was specifically referring to the use of electromagnetic waves to control weather. Quoted at the opening of a dam in the central province of Arak, he told reporters, “According to reports about climate, whose authenticity has been verified, the European countries have used certain equipment to discharge clouds and prevent rain-bearing clouds from reaching regional countries such as Iran.” 

The ‘certain equipment’ to which he refers is probably that known as ‘atmospheric resonance technology’. This technology has a history stretching back to the work of Nikola Tesla in the late nineteen century. Tesla carried out experiments involving electromagnetic flux and the earth’s gravitational field.

Reports of experiments to use this technology for the modification of weather patterns can be traced back to the early 1990s and HAARP - High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program – an ionispheric research programme. In addition to the intended target of improved radio communications and surveillance, it has been postulated that such a programme could be used to alter weather patterns – an idea which has appealed to military strategists for many decades. But evidence that such schemes have been put into place is limited.

More recently, some relatively small-scale commercial operations have claimed to have ‘lassoed’ passing weather systems using methods based on electromagnetism to deliver rain to fee-paying customers.

For those concerned, like Mr Ahmadinejad, then a word of caution is required: such technology is much loved by internet conspiracy theorists. Similarly, an internet engine search for ‘chemtrails’ will lead the gullible to the belief that our every thought is being controlled by chemicals released from high-flying aircraft – although by whom is never made clear.

The uncertainty of weather does not sit well with our desire for ordered and controlled lives. Attempts to control our weather are likely to increase and there is every chance that they will meet with greater success in the future. But for the time-being, explanations for water shortages are more likely to be of a more mundane nature – such as leaky pipes, Mr Ahmadinejad."

But many experts say there’s little evidence that hot, sunny days actually make beaches safer.

Although sunlight can help kill coronaviruses on surfaces, it doesn’t work fast enough to help beachgoers, said Andrea Armani, a professor of chemical engineering and materials science at USC.

“It doesn’t make it safe to go out to the beach because the time it takes for the sun to kill the virus is exceptionally long,” Armani said.

A coronavirus’ outer layer weakens as the temperature rises, Armani said. So when ultraviolet light from the sun heats up surfaces where the virus lands, its survival period will be somewhat shorter. (How much shorter depends on multiple factors, she added.)

But the sun won’t make much difference in spots where shade or clouds reduce the optical intensity of sunlight. Nor will sunshine prevent the virus from spreading from person to person through droplets of saliva or mucus in the air.

Karin Michels, chair of the epidemiology department at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, said there was “no good data” to support the idea that the UV in sunlight would make any difference in the coronavirus infection rate.

The risk, she said, depends more on how many people show up to the beach and whether they can practice proper physical distancing.

Judging from the photos of people flocking to Orange County beaches during last weekend’s heat wave, that hasn’t seemed to be the case, she said.

“People don’t stay apart enough,” she said, “and so that is also an argument to be a little concerned.”

Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, agreed that much of the risk hinged on human behavior.

“While it is true that the UV radiation contained in sunlight is detrimental to the [virus’] viability on surfaces, many beach activities would give the virus an opportunity to pass — not from surfaces — but from person to person,” he said in an email.

Armani also pointed out that people are less likely to have opportunities to wash their hands at the beach, and are probably less likely to wear face masks.

“A lot of those standards are going to be harder to maintain at the beach,” she said.

The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight that reaches the Earth’s surface, which includes the types known as UVA and UVB, should not be confused with a higher-energy form known as UVC.

UVC can be used to quickly kill pathogens on surfaces in controlled settings such as hospitals, but it’s extremely dangerous and can potentially burn a person’s skin or even blind them, according to Jim Malley, an environmental engineer at the University of New Hampshire."

They have reached this point kicking and screaming, under great public pressure, after clinging for years to the fiction that they are just public utilities and that people can use their pipes for pretty much anything.

But now they have united, for a brief moment at least, against a major conspiracy theorist.

Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify have all taken action against Alex Jones.

They are deathly afraid of being accused of political bias, sometimes for good reason. Both Facebook and Twitter have both grappled with incidents of discrimination against conservatives, which may have made them gun-shy about banning (as opposed to shadow-banning) some folks.

But almost in unison, the tech giants teamed up against Jones, who runs Infowars.

Candidate Donald Trump appeared on Jones' online show in 2015, and yesterday Jones tweeted a video defense with the headline: ""EMERGENCY: President Trump Must Defend the First Amendment.""

Facebook said it has taken down some Jones pages ""for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.""

Apple said it removed the ""Alex Jones Show"" and other podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app. The company said it ""does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users.""

Google’s YouTube dropped the ax on Jones' channel, telling The Washington Post that it terminates users who violate ""our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures.""

And Spotify banned Jones altogether after earlier removing some podcasts, telling the Post: ""We take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community.""

I know Jones has a lot of fans—remember the controversy swirling around his interview with Megyn Kelly—but he's also a guy being sued by Sandy Hook parents for saying that the horrible massacre at that Connecticut school was a hoax.

Jones apologized last year, in careful language, for spreading the phony Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying he'd been given inaccurate information.

That’s not ""conservative."" That's at odds with reality.

Jones texted the Post that being banned by the tech companies was ""a counter-strike against the global awakening.""

""We've seen a giant yellow journalism campaign with thousands and thousands of articles for weeks, for months misrepresenting what I've said and done to set the precedent to de-platform me before Big Tech and the Democratic Party as well as some Republican establishment types move against the First Amendment in this country as we know it,"" he said.

Separately, Jones called The New York Times a ""globalist intelligence agency"" and said that the ""evil, wicked sociopaths"" who work for major media outlets were teaming up to take down Infowars.

I confess I'd like to know how the four tech companies happened to take action on the same day. Perhaps they concluded there was safety in numbers. They seemed to have an ally in Drudge, whose banner headline was ""APPLE REGULATES HATE.""

But this is just a skirmish. Just recently, Mark Zuckerberg got himself into trouble by saying he saw no reason to ban pages by Holocaust deniers.

There is a fine line between banning hate and bullying on one hand and censoring controversial political opinions on the other. These battles will play out in a hyperpartisan political atmosphere. But for now, Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify have all agreed there is one person who falls on the wrong side of that line."

There are no additional deaths to report.

There are now 282 reported cases which we can confirm have recovered – an increase of 41 on yesterday.

The combined total of confirmed and probable cases in New Zealand is 1210.

Today there are 12 people in hospital, including four in ICU – one each in Wellington, Waitemata, Counties Manukau and Southern DHBs. Two of these ICU patients are in a critical condition.

For those cases we have information on, we are still seeing a strong link to overseas travel though this is declining (41%), as well as links to confirmed cases within New Zealand (43%) including those in clusters we already know about and community transmission (2%). We are still investigating 14% of cases.

There are still 12 significant clusters. Our three largest clusters remain the same: Matamata (62); Bluff (81); and Marist College (84).

There were 4098 tests processed yesterday bringing the total number of cases carried out to date to 46,875.

Our 7 day rolling average of tests is at 3,343 per day.

Our test capacity continues to increase and we have supplies in stock for nearly 49,000 tests. We expect to have between 50,000 to 60,000 complete tests in stock by the end of the week.

We have 64 health care workers who are confirmed or probable for COVID-19.

The largest categories are 20 support or care workers; 17 nurses; 7 administrative related roles; 7 doctors and 3 medical students.

We know six of these 64 healthcare workers with COVID-19 have recovered.

We also know that more than a quarter of those have travelled overseas recently. We are working on a breakdown to determine how many of our healthcare workers infected in New Zealand were infected inside or outside the workplace.

We have analysed the data available for 35,000 people tested, which is for 39,000 tests as some people are tested more than once.

From that we can see that generally the DHBs doing the most testing are also the DHBs with the most confirmed and probable cases. 

 

 The ethnicity of the 35,000 people tested is:

The data, which currently excludes Waikato, will be regularly updated.

We do have sufficient vaccine for our priority groups, those aged 65 and over, pregnant women, and those with specific underlying health conditions. Despite the importance of those over 70 staying at home, anyone in this age group needing a flu vaccination is able to travel to get one. This is regarded as essential travel.

Travel for care for acute or chronic conditions is also regarded as essential travel."

Gases made from carbon, fluorine and chlorine, called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), long used as refrigerants, were banned in the 1990s because they damage the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation.

But similar compounds that don’t contain chlorine, fluorocarbons, are still widely used today in products including waterproof clothing and Teflon cookware because their strong carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds make them highly water repellent. They are even a key component of artificial blood thanks to their high oxygen solubility.

However, fluorocarbons are also powerful greenhouse gases. “The real culprits of ozone depletion have been largely eliminated,” says Robin Perutz at the University of York, UK. “But the remaining fluorocarbons do have a lot of global warming potential.”

One fluorocarbon, tetrafluoromethane, is 6,500 times as potent a greenhouse gas as CO , although it exists in much smaller amounts, and is unreactive enough to persist in the atmosphere for 50,000 years.

Fluorocarbons’ inertness also makes them difficult to clean up. “It’s fundamentally difficult to do anything with these bonds,” says Oleg Ozerov at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. “So it’s an interesting challenge to find ways to break them.”

In 2005, Ozerov’s team found that it can be done using extremely powerful “Lewis acids“, which contain positively charged ions that can rip negatively charged fluoride ions from C-F bonds. But the reaction is difficult to sustain for long periods as the acid tends to become exhausted by reacting with other compounds.

Now, Ozerov and Brandeis colleague Christos Douvris have found a way to sustain the reaction for long periods. Under their reaction, one molecule of Lewis acid can neutralise up to 2700 C-F bonds. This means just 0.5 milligrams of the acid converts 180 mg of fluorocarbons into a safer form in 24 hours, and at room temperature.

The process uses a Lewis acid discovered by Christopher Reed’s team at the University of California in Riverside. This contains silylium – a reactive form of silicon with three, rather than the usual four bonds and a positive charge.

The silylium acts like an molecular bomb that blows a C-F bond apart. A second reagent, triethylsilane, is like a peacekeeper, coming in afterwards to tame and tidy up the highly reactive compounds produced.

The process starts when a silylium molecule rips a fluoride ion from its carbon partner. That produces a stable silicon atom bonded to fluorine, and a highly reactive naked carbon ion is left behind.

This is then neutralised when it grabs a hydrogen ion from the silicon in a triethylsilane molecule, producing a safer carbon-hydrogen bond and creating a fresh molecule of silylium to attack more C-F bonds.

The reaction is a “downhill” process, using very little energy, says Ozerov, and the end products have little impact on the atmosphere.

Perutz, who was not involved in the study, is impressed with the new approach. “I would say that this is a real step change in effectiveness over what was possible before,” he says. But he points out that the process is as yet untested at the kilogram scale needed for it to be industrially useful.

“This is important chemistry both for the beauty of its chemical logic and for its efficiency,” says David O’Hagan, a fluorocarbon expert at St Andrews University, UK. “The selective and efficient removal of fluorine in this way is an unexpected and interesting development, which is of immediate significance.”

Other proposed methods for neutralising fluorocarbons rely on collecting and storing the chemical rather than converting it into safer forms. “But the fluorocarbons effectively have to be stored in perpetuity,” says Ozerov. “If it’s at all economically feasible, it would be better to put the fluorocarbons through a chemical transition rather than store them.”"

• Brits will be able to jet off to safe holiday spots next week
• Families are booking UK holidays ever 11 seconds after the easing of lockdown was announced
• The coronavirus R rate could be above crucial one in England
• There are plans to double the pupil ""bubble cap"" to 30 and scrap social distancing inside classrooms

And despite hopes that millions of antibody tests bought by the British government will be ""game changing"", some doctors have flagged concerns they ""can't be trusted"".

Last month the government purchased 10 million of the test kits from Abbott and Roche after studies from Public Health England found they were effective.

Now in a letter to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) a group of physicians and senior clinical academics have claimed there is no valid clinical reason for the large scale testing which is being carried out.

Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the NHS test-and-trace-programme said not enough is known about the level of protection such tests provide.

This is while Professor Jon Deeks, who led the first systematic review of studies on Covid antibody tests said: ""We don't have much data and we can't trust any of it.""

Meanwhile, leaked documents have suggested the coronavirus R rate could be above the crucial threshold of 1 in England.

Sage said last week that across the UK, the average Covid reproduction number is 0.7 to 0.9.

When the value is below one, it means transmission of the virus is no longer high and the epidemic is shrinking.

But an ""officially sensitive"" PHE document, seen by HuffPost UK, suggests officials aren't convinced the R rate is below one across the country.

It states: ""Current estimates of R is currently estimated to be below 1, in most regions at around 0.9, although there is uncertainty around these and thus and thus we cannot preclude R being above 1."""

Authorities have arrested dozens of medics, drug company representatives and bureaucrats on suspicion of siphoning off millions of dollars in state funding.

Valery Vakulchik, head of the powerful KGB state security service, in televised comments last month denounced what he called a vast system of procurement of drugs and medical equipment at inflated prices.

Prices were habitually hiked by up to 60 percent and in some cases even doubled, he said.

Following his announcement, 37 top health officials were arrested and criminal investigations were opened involving 60 people including local representatives of international pharmaceutical companies.

The KGB chief acknowledged that the Soviet-style bureaucracy in the country bordering the European Union, ruled by strongman Alexander Lukashenko, helped promote corruption.

""The existing system of procuring medical equipment and drugs created the conditions for corrupt practices,"" he said.

""Bona fide suppliers could not rely on a positive outcome,"" he added, while procurements were made not directly from producers but ""via numerous middlemen (and) finance companies.""

Those detained in the scandal include deputy health minister Igor Lositsky, doctors at reputed clinics and leading business figures involved in producing and importing medicines.

One of the arrested businessmen is Sergei Shakutin, director of Iskamed group, who is the brother of one of Lukashenko's close associates.

Belta state news agency has published photos of searches at the home of a medical centre director that uncovered $500,000 in cash.

Officers also found $620,000 in the garage of the director of a public enterprise that imported medical equipment.

The KGB chief said bribes paid to corrupt officials amounted to millions of dollars.

""There will be further arrests since the people detained so far are just the perpetrators,"" Sergei Satsuk, editor of news site Yezhednevnik, who is familiar with the case, told AFP.

The chief beneficiaries in such schemes were retired law enforcement officials who set up companies to enter the lucrative medical equipment market, Satsuk said.

""In 10 years they drained all the juice out of the country's medical system,"" he said.

He said this involved supplying equipment that was not just over-priced but also often lacked the necessary certification or came with faked documentation.

Some equipment was imported as second-hand but re-sold as new.

This is one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of Belarus, which is wedged between Russia and Poland and has been led by Lukashenko since 1994.

""Bureaucracy has privatised the state. We need to reform the whole system of state management, otherwise corruption schemes will spring up wherever budget funds are being spent,"" independent economist Yaroslav Romanchuk told AFP.

Other smaller corruption scandals have in recent years hit the sports, forestry and energy ministries as well as large companies, factories and banks.

Three ministers have been sacked and senior bureaucrats and regional officials have been arrested.

""Even if you clean out the state structures of bribe-takers, corruption won't die in Belarus for a single day,"" said Romanchuk.

""The very next day new people in old posts in the old system will relaunch the old corruption schemes.""

The system ""creates the most powerful temptation to set up schemes with kickbacks, bribes, swindling and abuses of office,"" Romanchuk said."

The signs were there the whole time: in what country is the only thing more poisonous than the snakes the spiders? How did we ever believe that kangaroos were a thing?

This discovery, believed by some to be a joke or a conspiracy theory, has been circulating on social media in recent weeks after being formulated on Reddit in early 2017. Except it turns out not to be the only theory of its kind: through the years, online sleuths have found that all sorts of places don’t exist.

High on the list is Finland, the country some believe lies between Russia and Sweden, and that allegedly fought a valiant rearguard action against Soviet invasion in the runup to the second world war. This theory was also born on Reddit, in 2015. Finland, the user Raregan explained, was merely a fictional creation designed to create fishing quotas to aid the export of sushi to Japan from Russia.

Last summer, another Reddit user suggested the Italian region of Molise – population 300,000 – doesn’t exist, apparently as the result of an Italian in-joke, while Brazilians have had for at least five years an online theory that the north-western state of Acre doesn’t exist or else is a land that time forgot, still populated by dinosaurs.

The joke – or painstakingly well-evidenced and argued theory – that a country or region doesn’t exist turns out to be one of the oldest memes on the internet. As early as 1993, German users of Usenet – a network of online discussion forms (or bulletin boards), which predates the web – had a running joke that the Westfalian town of Bielefeld (population 300,000, funnily enough) was a fiction maintained by the CIA, Mossad, aliens or some combination of the three.

The joke has crossed decades, online platforms, language barriers and international cultures, and keeps coming back.“The beauty of memes is that they are malleable and everyone can have their own spin on things and get involved in the joke,” says writer Mollie Goodfellow. “I think it says that we all like to be in on the joke, especially online, where often different cliques and subgroups can form.”

In these days of fake news and mainstream-media conspiracies, though, it doesn’t do to take anything for granted – so G2 contacted a diplomatic source, who agreed to speak off the record and confirm what they could about the existence (or otherwise) of Finland and Australia.

“Hang on, let me look out the window,” the source replied, before confirming Finland existed.

The source was unable to provide similar confirmation for Australia."

These claims suggest a pattern of connecting events and observations to an integrated whole.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"MIAMI — U.S. House candidate Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera has a long list of accomplishments to bolster her campaign in Florida. But she is perhaps best known for claiming that she was abducted by space aliens as a child.

Rodriguez Aguilera is a longshot in the race for the Miami-area seat being vacated by retiring Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Yet last weekend, the Miami Herald endorsed her for the GOP nomination in the Tuesday primary out of a field of nine candidates.

In an interview, Rodriguez Aguilera said she is grateful for the endorsement and that her tale of kidnapping by aliens does not define her.

""It has nothing to do with what I have done. It happened when I was 7 years old,"" she said. ""I am so proud of the Herald and what they did.""

Rodriguez Aguilera says she was taken aboard a spaceship as a young girl by blond extraterrestrials who resembled the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. She says they told her that the ""center of the world's energy is Africa"" and that thousands of non-human skulls were once discovered in a cave on the Mediterranean island of Malta.

She has said she witnessed paranormal activity since then and saw a UFO at age 17. She also said she has been in touch with the aliens telepathically long after the abduction.

Even if it's hard to believe there's a starman waiting in the sky, Rodriguez Aguilera won't back down.

""I stick to my guns when I believe in something,"" she said.

In its Sunday editorial , the Herald reported that two of the leading Republican candidates — former Miami-Dade commissioner Bruno Barreiro and Spanish-language television journalist Maria Elvira Salazar — did not take part in the paper's endorsement process. And beyond Rodriguez Aguilera, the editorial found the remaining candidates unprepared or unqualified.

""We realize that Rodriguez Aguilera is an unusual candidate,"" the editorial noted, adding that the paper was impressed with her ""boots-on-the-ground ideas and experience.""

Rodriguez Aguilera is a former City Council member in the suburb of Doral who is the daughter of a Cuban political prisoner. She previously was a social worker, ombudsman at the Miami-Dade county manager's office and now runs a business training women in other countries how to run for political office.

""The theme of my campaign is people above politics. I train people around the world about democracy,"" she said. ""I have the most experience. I can go in there and start working just as I have all my life.""

Whoever emerges from the GOP field Tuesday will face one of five Democratic candidates and the seat is considered one of the party's best chances for a switch from the GOP.

Polls show the leader on the Democratic side is former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who was also president of the University of Miami and University of Wisconsin. The Herald, however, endorsed state Rep. David Richardson over Shalala."

The scientists propose delivering the sulfates with specially designed high-altitude aircraft, balloons or large naval-style guns.

Despite the technology being undeveloped and with no existing aircraft suitable for adaptation, the researchers say that ""developing a new, purpose-built tanker with substantial payload capabilities would neither be technologically difficult nor prohibitively expensive.""

They estimate the total cost of launching a hypothetical system in 15 years' time at around $3.5 billion, with running costs of $2.25 billion a year over a 15-year period.

The report does, however, acknowledge that the technique is purely hypothetical. Release of new climate report moved up from December to Friday after Thanksgiving ""We make no judgment about the desirability of SAI,"" the report states. ""We simply show that a hypothetical deployment program commencing 15 years hence, while both highly uncertain and ambitious, would indeed be technically possible from an engineering perspective. It would also be remarkably inexpensive."" The researchers also acknowledge potential risks: coordination between multiple countries in both hemispheres would be required, and stratospheric aerosol injection techniques could jeopardize crop yields, lead to droughts or cause extreme weather. The proposals also don't address the issue of rising greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of global warming. No G20 countries are meeting climate targets, says report And despite the conviction of the report's authors, other experts were skeptical. ""From the point of view of climate economics, solar radiation management is still a much worse solution than greenhouse gas emissions: more costly and much more risky over the long run,"" said Philippe Thalmann of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, an expert in the economics of climate change. David Archer of the Department of Geophysical Science at the University of Chicago said, ""The problem with engineering climate in this way is that it's only a temporary Band-Aid covering a problem that will persist essentially forever, actually hundreds of thousands of years for fossil fuel CO2 to finally go away naturally. ""It will be tempting to continue to procrastinate on cleaning up our energy system, but we'd be leaving the planet on a form of life-support. If a future generation failed to pay their climate bill they would get all of our warming all at once."""

There's also the ChemTrail crowd that thought the Republican government used planes to dump toxins on liberal areas to make us sick, disrupt pregnancies, and sap our will to resist. Etc., etc., So yeah, that paranoid style is alive on the fringes of the American left.

But with the Right, it's a bit different. The paranoid and conspiratorial style is much more mainstream, especially with Beck and Fox. On Fox, there are shadowy links between Soros, the Tides Foundation, and other liberal causes that aim to bring America down. Obama is at once fascist and a socialist.

“Angels & Demons,” again starring Tom Hanks as Langdon and directed by Ron Howard, premieres in Rome Monday at a theater a mile away from Vatican City.

In the film, Langdon is recruited by the Vatican after the pope dies and four cardinals who are favorites to succeed him are kidnapped.

Langdon races through the “Eternal City” deciphering clues linked to a centuries-old secret society, the Illuminati.

“He is not the man the Vatican trusts — he is the man the Vatican needs,” Howard said in production notes for the movie.

Ewan McGregor plays the central role of the “Camerlengo,” or chamberlain, who runs the Vatican between the time of the pope’s death and the election of his successor.

“He sees himself as a man who will do whatever it takes to save the Church from the Illuminati and everything they represent,” McGregor said.

The film hits theatres in the United States on May 15.

Angels & Demons has so far avoided the kind of broadside the Vatican aimed at The Da Vinci Code film in 2005 and 2006 and the following year at “The Golden Compass” starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.

“Dramatizing the issue involuntarily gives publicity to Angels & Demons,” said Archbishop Velasio De Paolis, in an interview with Italy’s La Stampa newspaper.

“Be careful not to play their game.”

The Da Vinci Code upset the Vatican and some Catholics because of its storyline, in which Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had children, creating a royal bloodline that Church officials kept secret for centuries.

Christians are taught that Jesus never married, was crucified and rose from the dead.

Despite the controversy, and a critical mauling at the Cannes film festival where it was launched, The Da Vinci Code went on to gross more than $750 million worldwide, supporting the theory that no publicity is bad publicity.

However, the Rome archdiocese did refuse Angels & Demons the right to shoot in historic churches, forcing the crew to recreate them in Los Angeles.

And in the United States, Bill Donahue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, accused Brown and Howard of “smearing the Catholic Church with fabulously bogus tales.”

Howard responded by saying that neither he nor his new movie were anti-Catholic.

“And let me be a little controversial: I believe Catholics, including most in the hierarchy of the Church, will enjoy the movie for what it is: an exciting mystery, set in the awe-inspiring beauty of Rome,” Howard wrote in a post on The Huffington Post website."

Sterling saw wild fluctuations Tuesday as it hit a near two-year high on news the prime minister had won a last-minute revision to her agreement with the EU, then tanked to a three-week low as it was rejected later in the day at Westminster.

The decision means lawmakers will vote Wednesday on whether to leave the EU on March 29 without an economic agreement -- which is expected to fail -- then Thursday on whether to extend the deadline.

However, there remains a lot of uncertainty, with some observers suggesting the latest developments put the country a step closer to another referendum, while others say it could make a no-deal exit more likely.

""My tuppence is that parliament has, in their own mind, seized control of the Brexit process and will duly ask and likely get an extension to the 29 March exit date,"" said OANDA senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley.

""The breathing space granted will be used by whomever to renegotiate a more palatable Brexit deal for the UK. Except nobody has asked the Europeans yet. A short-term gain may yet belie long-term pain.""

The news from London added to selling pressure on Asian equity markets, which had enjoyed a bounce Monday and Tuesday from last week's battering, with investors still on edge over the state of the global economy.

Tokyo ended the morning 1.4 percent lower, while Shanghai fell 0.7 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.5 percent and Sydney shed 0.6 percent.

Seoul fell 0.9 percent, Singapore was off 0.7 percent and Wellington retreated 0.3 percent with Manila and Jakarta also taking a hit.

With very little news coming out of Beijing and Washington regarding the trade talks, investors are moving to the sidelines until there is something concrete to buy on.

""Until the world's two largest economies conclude an agreement... it will be difficult to gauge a clearer picture of the global economy in 2019,"" added Halley.

""The outcome of the trade talks --and perhaps the US-eurozone will likely follow -- will dictate whether we will gently roll down the slope or off the edge of the cliff.""

Sample analysis for trace elements was accomplished by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Many elements in ambient air exhibit strong spatial gradients from urban centers to the coast, and the concentrations of most elements at Liberty Science Center are significantly higher than at the other two locations. Seasonal patterns are not apparent for most elements at all locations, suggesting continuous contributions from their sources. The elements Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, V, Sb, are enriched by factors of 200 to 20,000 relative to their natural abundance in crustal soil. Major sources that contribute to the atmospheric loading of these elements include fossil fuel combustion, oil combustion, metal processing industry, and waste incineration.

Other groups which could also soon be in line to host weddings in Scotland include the Flat Earth Society , which rejects evidence that the world is round – a view once held by the Christian church.

The Church's predictions came as it launched an attack on plans by the First Minister, Alex Salmond, for a new class of “belief” ceremonies – alongside traditional religious and civil weddings.

The Scottish Government is currently attempting to overhaul the marriage laws north of the border, primarily to introduce same-sex marriage.

But the bill would also include a wider update of matrimonial laws including plans to create a “third way” to get married, through so-called “belief” ceremonies to accommodate those who do not belief in a deity but do but do promote a belief system.

It follows the popularity of humanist weddings in Scotland, which have outstripped even the Roman Catholic Church in popularity.

The Humanist Society of Scotland has been registered to perform weddings since 2005 on a temporary basis but the new bill would set that on a permanent footing and create a new class of marriage.

But The Rev Iver Martin, spokesman for the Free Church of Scotland, said the plan was “nonsensical” as humanists are already free to conduct weddings in Scotland.

He said: “We are faced with the Scottish Government seeking to create a new category for something which already happens under the current system, which is completely nonsensical.”

“We would also question whether this category only includes humanists or will it allow for any belief?

“Could the Jedi Knights or members of the Flat Earth Society be registered as belief celebrants?

“We believe that once the legislation is passed the issues and complications will not go away.”

In the Star Wars films, Jedis rely on the strength of ""The Force"" to help them overcome baddies such as Darth Vader.

In the 2001 census almost 400,000 people in England and Wales registered themselves as “Jedi” followers on their census forms.

But it was not because hundreds of thousands of people had succumbed to the power of the Force – it followed an internet campaign to subvert the census findings on religion. An email urging people to write Jedi on their census forms aid: “Do it because you love Star Wars ... or just to annoy people”."

The country's 47 million residents can freely travel for the first time since mid-March and visitors from Britain and the 26 European countries that allow visa-free travel can visit Spain without going through a two-week quarantine.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that hygiene controls must be followed and had this warning: ""The virus can return and it can hit us again in a second wave, and we have to do whatever we can to avoid that at all costs.""

BBC News said Spain usually attracts some 80 million tourists a year, providing 12% of the country's GDP. The Associated Press reports there was only a trickle of travelers at Madrid-Barajas Airport as the travel restrictions were lifted, a stark contrast to a normal June day when it would be crowded.

""It's very special, it's three and a half months since I've been here!"" a Swiss woman told BBC News at the airport. She lives in Madrid and traveled home on a flight from Zurich.

BBC News also noted that several bars and restaurants in Spain have been open for some weeks. A number of them near the city's famous Plaza Mayor were busy Sunday afternoon.

Despite the loosening restrictions in Spain, other areas like Brazil and South Africa are facing rises in COVID-19 infections. The total number of worldwide cases has topped 8.8 million and the virus has killed more than 465,000 people, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Spain's death toll is more than 28,000, the third-highest in the European Union, per BBC.

Elsewhere, Brazil is grappling with 50,000 new cases in one day, according to health officials. President Jair Bolsonaro has been downplaying the risks there, even though it has the second-highest death toll in the world, behind the U.S.

South Africa reported a one-day high of almost 5,000 new cases Saturday and 46 deaths, AP reports. But President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a further loosening of restrictions, even as the virus spreads.

In India, the rush to ease lockdowns may have helped its economy, but it's also resulted in more infections. New Delhi is converting train carriages into makeshift COVID-19 wards, offering beds and oxygen, but not much social distancing.

In the U.S., the virus seems to be spreading across the West and South. Arizona on Sunday reported 3,100 new infections, just shy of Friday's record-high, and 26 deaths. Nevada also reported a new high of 445 cases, according to AP. In New York, once the nation's epicenter, the virus has killed more than 17,500 people since the start of the pandemic, according to city data.

Florida on Saturday reported 4,049 new coronavirus cases, another consecutive single-day record increase in cases. The number of statewide infections has surged to at least 97,000 as of Sunday. There have been more than 3,160 deaths in Florida due to COVID-19. The state has tested nearly 1.6 million people, according to its health department. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis hasn't indicated any rollback of the state's reopening, despite the surge in COVID-19 deaths.

That’s the ruling issued today (pdf) by a panel of the General Medical Council, which regulates the medical profession in the UK.

Andrew Wakefield, who worked at the Royal Free Hospital, London, in 1998 when his controversial paper on MMR and autism was published, has said that he will appeal against the verdict.

Wakefield has told the BBC in a radio interview that he “categorically denies the charges” and will appeal against the verdict. If he doesn’t, he will automatically be struck off the UK medical register in 28 days.

The GMC panel also ruled that John Walker-Smith (pdf), a former colleague of Wakefield’s at the Royal Free Hospital, should be struck off. It cleared a third colleague, Simon Murch (pdf), of any wrongdoing.

The panel found Wakefield guilty of a litany of transgressions in the late 1990s, when he and his colleagues conducted their research on 12 children, leading to publication of the controversial findings in The Lancet in 1998.

The findings, retracted by The Lancet in February this year (pdf), linked the vaccine shots with the development of autism and bowel disorders. Panicked parents failed to have their children vaccinated, and the uptake rate for MMR, which had peaked at 92 per cent, fell to a low of 81 per cent in 2004.

The transgressions listed by the panel include dishonesty about the paper itself, undeclared conflicts of interest and ethical irregularities in how the children were recruited and managed during course of the research.

The panel points out that Wakefield’s patent on an alternative to MMR called Transfer Factor meant he stood to gain financially by discrediting the triple vaccine. He was also appearing as an expert witness in a court action against the vaccine.

He failed to mention any of this either to the hospital’s research and ethics committee or to The Lancet, the panel says.

The panel also concluded that Wakefield subjected the children to painful and invasive procedures that were not clinically necessary. Three children had spinal fluid taken through lumbar punctures, for example, and others underwent colonoscopies.

Not all the children had a history of being treated for gastrointestinal problems, contrary to what was stated in the paper in The Lancet, and nine underwent procedures for which Wakefield had not sought ethical approval.

The panel also condemned Wakefield’s failure to state in The Lancet the true purpose of the research, which was to investigate a proposed new syndrome following vaccination.

On another occasion, in 1999, he took blood from children at a party then paid them £5 for agreeing to it.

“Accordingly, the panel has determined that Dr Wakefield’s name should be erased from the medical register,” it said in its ruling, citing the need to protect patients and to maintain public trust and confidence in the medical profession.

The panel also recommended striking off John Walker-Smith for subjecting children to painful but unnecessary procedures, including colonoscopies, barium meals and lumbar punctures. The panel determined that, like Wakefield, Walker-Smith, an author on The Lancet paper, ought to have known of the widespread implications of the paper, and failed in his duty to ensure that the information in it was accurate.

Simon Murch was cleared of any wrongdoing and is free to continue practising as a doctor. The panel accepted that in carrying out colonoscopies for Walker-Smith, Murch was quite reasonably deferring to the clinical judgements and authority of his senior colleague.

The investigation is the longest in the GMC’s history, having lasted more than three years. Earlier this year, the GMC issued its preliminary findings on whether the three should face censure.

Shortly after this, Wakefield left the Thoughtful House Center for Children, which he founded in 2005 in Austin, Texas, to treat autism and related disorders.

Wakefield has no licence to practise in the US, and the GMC says it will circulate its verdict on him to similar bodies throughout the world."

DeStefano graduated from Cornell University in 1974, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree, and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, from which he received a medical degree in 1978. He received his MPH at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1984.[1]

DeStefano is an author of a number of scientific studies concluding that vaccines, in particular thimerosal-containing ones, do not cause autism. In March 2013, for example, DeStefano was the lead author on a study in the Journal of Pediatrics, which concluded that exposure of children to particular ingredients in vaccines, namely proteins and polysaccharides, did not increase their risk of autism. In addition, DeStefano et al. concluded that children with autism had received the same number of antigens as children without.[2] This study received widespread media attention.[3][4][5]

As director of the ISO, his research focuses primarily on alleged and real adverse reactions to vaccines, and how common these reactions are. As mentioned above, some of DeStefano's research pertains to the use of thiomersal in vaccines; for example, he co-authored a study in 2003 in Pediatrics which concluded that there was no consistent association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders.[6] In addition, he was the final author of a study on the alleged link between thimerosal and autism, authored by the Vaccine Safety Datalink team, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study concluded that ""Our study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years.""[7] Other topics he has published research on include Guillain–Barré syndrome,[8] as well as the potential link between seizures and the whole-cell pertussis vaccine or MMR vaccine.[9] More generally, with regard to the VSD, he published a study in 2001 summarizing the ability of the project to reveal potential risks associated with vaccination, especially intussusception, through conduction of a population-based cohort study.[10]

Originally, however, DeStefano's research focused on the safety of contraceptives, a topic he researched from 1982 to 1984 as a medical officer at the National Institutes of Health.[11] Also in 1982, he joined the CDC as a senior epidemiologist in the Agent Orange projects.

After completing a residency in pediatrics at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, he joined the Epidemic Intelligence Service in 1979. In 1982, he completed a CDC residency in preventive medicine. In 2004, DeStefano was appointed acting chief of the Immunization Safety Branch of the National Immunization Program, now known as the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. From 1992 to 1996, DeStefano held a post at the Marshfield Medical Research Foundation in Marshfield, Wisconsin. In 1996, he returned to the CDC.[12]

A Google search shows that this false claim has been circulating for years. Snopes reported in 2012 that the ID card with the number shown in the image belonged to a student named Thomas Lugert ( here ).

The photo of the original ID appears on a blog that Lugert wrote about his experience at Columbia University ( archive.vn/TU4et ). The word ""student"" in Lugert’s ID has been altered to ""foreign student"" in the claim. ​

ID cards like the one shown in the claim weren’t introduced by Columbia until 1996 ( here ). Obama graduated with the class of 1983 ( here ).

The photograph of Obama used in the claim is from a book about his life. It can be seen on the cover of ""Barack Obama: The Story"" by David Maraniss ( here ).​

Soetoro was the last name of Obama’s Indonesian stepfather Lolo. It may have been used in the claim to make him sound more foreign ( here ) ​

Obama served two terms as U.S. president, from 2009 to 2017. In 2011, he took the rare step of publishing his long-form birth certificate to prove that he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and rebut conspiracy theories – backed at the time by Donald Trump, among others - that he was not born in America and therefore ineligible under the constitution to be president. ( here ). Trump abandoned the ‘birther’ claim in 2016 after promoting it for five years ( here ).

False. The image purporting to be Barack Obama’s ‘foreign student’ ID card is a fake. ​

You might have noticed how bright green your plants look after rain. Or you may have been watering your garden this summer, over many hot days and weeks.

So, which water is best for your plants? The stuff that falls out of the sky or the water that comes out of the tap?

You might be surprised to find that rain, especially during a thunderstorm, has special qualities that can give your plants a boost.

Read more: Why does some tap water taste weird?

This summer, much of the east coast of Australia has been affected by a series of intense summer thunder storms. A rare combination of events saw thunderstorms stretch from North Queensland to Tasmania. Tropical cyclone Penny also caused very heavy rain in far north Queensland.

Although winds and hail can damage a garden, rain during thunder storms can be particularly special for plants. That’s because lightning helps add nitrogen to your garden.

Australian soils are notoriously poor in nutrients and nitrogen is no exception. Plants crave nitrogen for a range of reasons, in particular to produce chlorophyll, the green photosynthetic pigment. If plants are deficient in nitrogen, they might look yellowish. If the nitrogen levels are very low for extended periods of time plants might be stunted, get sick or die.

Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere but plants cannot access it directly from the sky as it takes too much energy to turn it into a form they can actually use.

Instead, plants can get their nitrogen from other sources, in processes scientists broadly refer to as nitrogen fixation.

Nitrogen can come from added fertilisers, the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and organisms that can break down atmospheric nitrogen into something usable.

Plants can also get their nitrogen from high-energy processes in the atmosphere, like solar radiation and lightning, which is where summer storms come in.

The enormous heat and pressure that lightning generates provides enough energy to break down and convert atmospheric nitrogen into a number of reactive nitrogen species. When mixed with oxygen and water in the atmosphere the resulting rainfall will contain greater levels of nitrates and ammonium.

For over a billion lightning flashes around the globe each year, 2 billion kilograms of reactive nitrogen is produced.

The total amount of nitrogen in rainfall varies depending on where you live and the season. A coastal region that is subject to industrial activity may have greater nitrogen deposition.

Once the rain drops reach the ground they deposit ammonium and nitrates that can be used by plants, whilst bacteria and fungi in the soil can further transform the available nitrogen in a process known as nitrification.

So, if you have had wet summer thunderstorms roll over your property, not only will your plants have had a good watering, they will have had a top up of nitrogen.

How about other factors?

Comparing tap water, that is supplied as treated drinking water, with rainwater that falls outside of summer storms can be tricky. That’s because some tap water is more alkaline (a higher pH) or saltier (have a higher ionic strength) than others. Prolonged watering with water that has a higher levels of chloride (and to a lesser extent, fluoride) can also stop the plant from taking up available nitrate. Plants can also be harmed by the surprisingly high levels of sodium in some drinking water supplies.

Read more: Your drinking water could be saltier than you think (even if you live in a capital)

Processed drinking water is almost always a poor source of nitrate. There is a very good reason for this. Water authorities all seek to minimise the nitrate content of drinking water, because high concentrations can be dangerous for babies and trigger blue baby syndrome.

Most gardeners want a slightly acidic pH because it makes nutrients more available for plants and is better for overall soil health. Here, rainwater might be your friend (pH 5.6). Tap water is more alkaline (between pH 6-8.5) depending on where your drinking water is sourced. So certain tap waters can work against you and your plants.

So what kind of water should you use on your plants, if you have the choice? Here’s the order, in best to worst:

There are also other reasons why plants sometimes look greener after rain. It can also be from the rain washing dust from plants. This is quite plausible given the dust storms in recent weeks."

Someone released an unofficial wanted notice to try and find the pastor in question.

One of the people who saw the video was a Haitian senator, the aptly named Jean-Renel Sénatus. He decided to investigate the incident:

This man goes by the name of Pastor Berger Moderne [which translates to Pastor Modern Shepherd]. He is 32 years old and he created a congregation called “Lamé sélès” in creole [in English, the Celestial Army] that follows doctrine similar to the Pentecostal Church. In the video, he is mistreating the child because he claims that the child has an unidentified illness and that this ritual can heal him.

I launched a public appeal on the radio. I managed to make contact with the parents of this child and to speak with them. I was surprised to find out that they see this pastor as a protector of their family, even if they agreed that he had been acting in a violent manner.

However, they refused to file a complaint or to tell me if they had given him money to perform the ritual.

“The pastor has been making videos to say that I am wasting my time”

The pastor fled and is now in hiding. I asked the police to open an investigation to find him. The investigation is underway.

In the meantime, the pastor has been making videos that he shares online to mock me and to say that I should spend my time and my money building an orphanage for his church! [Editor’s note: In one of these videos, the pastor features the mother of the child from the original video. The mother claims that everything is ok and that the child's health is even improving].

In this video shared online by the pastor, the mother of the child seen in the viral video says that her child is fine and is, in fact, doing better since the pastor performed the ritual.

I often work on issues relating to children in Haiti. This is the first time that I’ve seen a pastor be so violent that said, we don’t even know if he is a legitimate pastor or just a crook. The problem is that the state doesn’t keep an eye on these religious groups, most of whom haven’t registered with the Ministry of Religion. These little churches end up like countries within our country where they do as they like."

U.S. District Judge Kentanji B. Jackson said that while no one was injured when Edgar Maddison Welch fired his weapon inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Dec. 4, his actions “literally left psychological wreckage.”

Welch acknowledged as part of a guilty plea in March that he entered the restaurant with an AR-15 and a revolver. He said he drove to the restaurant from North Carolina to investigate unfounded internet rumors about Democrats harboring child sex slaves there.

The judge said Welch “forged ahead” with an “ill-conceived plot” even though others urged him to abandon it. If Welch believed children were being harmed, he should have notified law enforcement, the judge said.

This election cycle saw its fair share of so-called “fake news.” On December 4, an armed man walked into a Washington, DC, pizza joint, claiming he needed to investigate a story he had heard: that Hillary Clinton and her former campaign manager were hosting a child sex ring there. Hari Sreenivasan speaks with The Washington Post’s Marc Fisher about how and why this fiction spread as fact.

Welch’s attorney had asked for a sentence of 1 and a half years in prison. Prosecutors wanted 4 and a half years.

Welch spoke briefly to apologize, saying he realized that his words “cannot undo or change what already happened.”

His mother, father, sister and fiancée were in the courtroom.

Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis spoke before sentencing. Alefantis called “pizzagate” a “viscous web of lies” and said many people had suffered because of Welch’s actions.

In a primary alkyl halide, the carbon that bears the halogen is directly bonded to one other carbon, in a secondary alkyl halide to two, and in a tertiary alkyl halide to three.

The methods used to prepare alkyl halides and the reactions that alkyl halides undergo frequently depend on whether the alkyl halide is primary, secondary, or tertiary.

A halogen substituent draws the electrons in the C―X bond toward itself, giving the carbon a partial positive charge (δ+) and the halogen a partial negative charge (δ-). The presence of the resulting polar covalent bond makes most alkyl halides polar compounds. Because the bond dipole (the measure of the separation of charge) of a C―X bond is the product of a charge term (largest for fluorine and smallest for iodine) and a distance term (smallest for fluorine and largest for iodine), the molecular dipole moments of alkyl halides do not vary much from one halogen to another.

The most important reactions of organohalogen compounds involve breaking the carbon-halogen bond by processes in which the halogen retains both of the electrons from the original bond and is lost as a negatively charged ion (X−). Consistent with the order of carbon-halogen bond strengths, in which the bond to fluorine is the strongest and the bond to iodine the weakest of the carbon-halogen bonds, fluorides are normally observed to be the least reactive of the alkyl halides and iodides the most reactive.

The boiling points of ethyl halides increase as the atomic number of the halogen increases. With increasing atomic number the halogen becomes more polarizable, meaning that the electric field associated with the atom is more easily distorted by the presence of nearby electric fields. Fluorine is the least polarizable of the halogens and iodine the most polarizable. An increased polarizability is associated with stronger intermolecular attractive forces of the London dispersion type (see chemical bonding: Intermolecular forces) and therefore with an increased boiling point.

Multiple halogen substitution tends to increase the boiling point: CH Cl boils at −24 °C (−11 °F), CH Cl at 40 °C (104 °F), CHCl at 61 °C (142 °F), and CCl at 77 °C (171 °F). Multiple fluorine substitution is an exception, however: CH CH F boils at −32 °C (−26 °F), CH CHF at −25 °C (−13 °F), CH CF at −47 °C (−53 °F), and CF CF at −78 °C (−108 °F). By reducing the molecular polarizability, multiple fluorine substitution weakens the strength of dispersion forces between molecules. In the liquid state these weakened intermolecular attractive forces are reflected in unusually low boiling points, and in the solid state they are responsible for the novel properties of fluorocarbon polymers.

The densities of alkyl halides are related to intermolecular attractive forces and tend to parallel boiling points, alkyl fluorides being the least dense and alkyl iodides the most dense. In general, alkyl fluorides and chlorides are less dense than water, and bromides and iodides are more dense than water. Alkyl halides are not soluble in water."

Emerging markets (EM) are suffering two sudden stops – in economic activity and in capital flows – but only one of them is ‘unprecedented’, writes David Lubin, Head of Emerging Markets Economics at Citi.

“As far as capital flows are concerned, the news is bad but not catastrophic, and risk appetite towards EM seems higher today than it did at the same point of the Global Financial Crisis.

“The collapse in emerging market inflation will give central banks more scope for easing. We think emerging markets might see rate cuts in the coming months that, by normal standards, might seem shockingly low.

“A key question for emerging markets is whether investors, both domestic and foreign, have any confidence that these countries can grow out of their debt, and on this issue we are pessimistic. Low interest rates in developed markets might help push capital towards emerging markets, but that’s not a reason to be confident about the future of the asset class given the uncertainties that now afflict the global economy.”

HSBC’s head of equity strategy for Asia-Pacific, Herald van der Linde, has written in a blog that many countries are trying to look at suppliers outside of China in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, with some governments encouraging ‘re-shoring’ – bringing factories home.

“But highly complex production networks established over decades cannot be easily re-shored or relocated. Where products are highly specialised or where mainland China is dominant, as with 5G telephony or cosmetics, it is nearly impossible – or it will take considerable time – to move those supply chains.”

In addition, Van der Linde notes there are companies using the current situation to increase operations in China, with the Chinese government offering incentives to attract foreign investment.

Van der Linde also predicts that tensions between Beijing and Washington could accelerate plans for China to become self-sufficient in energy, power and technology."
654,False,The article does not mention any conspiracy theories.,False,The article does not mention any specific actors responsible for the measles outbreak.,False,The article does not mention any intentional or malicious actions.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. It's now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination. Anyone can get measles if they have not been vaccinated or have not had it before, although it's most common in young children. The infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days.

The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected.
• cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing and a cough
• sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
• a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C
• small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks A few days later, a red-brown blotchy rash will appear. This usually starts on the head or upper neck before spreading outwards to the rest of the body.

At the moment it can be hard to know what to do if your child is unwell. It's important to trust your instincts and get medical help if you need it.

When to see a GP You should contact a GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child may have measles. It's best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery may need to make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others. You should also see a GP if you have been in close contact with someone who has measles and have not:
• been fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine
• had the infection before You should do this even if you do not have any symptoms.

Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you have had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again. But it can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).

The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can easily catch measles by:
• touching a surface the droplets have settled on and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth (the virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours) People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about 4 days after the rash first appears.

How measles can be prevented Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 13 months old, and a second dose is given at 3 years and 4 months. Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they have not been fully vaccinated before. Ask a GP about having the vaccination. If the MMR vaccine is not suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles.

How you can ease the symptoms of measles There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection.
• taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains (aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old)
• closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity
• using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes
• staying off school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment."

“The American public finds itself in a fog of something short of war, with few ways to assess what could be coming,” Gilsinan and Giglio write. This public confusion about unspecified threats feels uncomfortably similar to the lead-up to the Iraq War—with the very important difference that the president keeps saying he doesn’t want a war. Another similarity: The U.S. and its European allies are divided about the severity of the threat in the Middle East.

Conflict with Iran feels less likely than it did even at the start of the week, when The New York Times reported that the administration was considering a plan to send 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran attacked U.S. assets. (President Donald Trump denied that.) Asked on Thursday if the U.S. would go to war with Iran, Trump responded, “I hope not.”

Watch for whether Trump continues to publicly contradict his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton. Will Trump or Bolton offer any clues this week about the nature of the intel that pushed Washington to gear up for a fight with Tehran? As long as officials keep talking up Iran’s threats while Americans remain in the dark, this saga isn’t over.

The head of the global vaccine alliance has warned ""nobody is safe unless everybody is safe"" from the new coronavirus, urging international solidarity ahead of a fundraising summit as the pandemic threatens to trigger a resurgence of preventable diseases.

Scientists are racing to identify and test possible vaccines for COVID-19 as nations grapple with the economic and societal consequences of the virus lockdowns.

Seth Berkley of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, said the international community must ensure all countries will have access to any potential vaccines, regardless of their wealth.

""This is a global problem that needs a global solution and we have to all work together,"" he said.

He spoke ahead of a virtual summit hosted by Britain on Thursday, where Gavi hopes to raise at least $7.4 billion to continue vaccination programmes against diseases like measles, polio and typhoid that have been severely disrupted by the pandemic.

The meeting will also see Gavi and its partners launch a financing drive to purchase potential COVID-19 vaccines, scale up their production, and support delivery to developing nations.

The fundraising goal for COVID-19 is $2 billion, although Berkley said it was an initial sum as they kickstart negotiations with manufacturers and could go up ""substantially"".

The meeting comes as the pandemic exposes new ruptures in international cooperation.

US President Donald Trump last week announced he would pull out of the World Health Organization and there are fears America may use its economic clout to buy up vaccines.

Berkley said that countries needed a ""different mindset"", adding that sharing access to drugs was not just a humanitarian and equality issue, but a global health security one.

""Nobody is safe unless everybody is safe. We saw the virus move from somewhere around Wuhan to 180 countries in less than three months, including islands and isolated areas,"" he said.

The World Health Organization, UN children's agency UNICEF and Gavi warned last month that the pandemic had hindered routine immunisation services in nearly 70 countries, affecting around 80 million children under the age of one.

Polio eradication drives were suspended in dozens of countries, including those still struggling with the debilitating illness, while measles vaccination campaigns were also put on hold in 27 countries, UNICEF said.

Recent Gavi-supported modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine estimated that for every COVID-19 death prevented by halting vaccination campaigns in Africa, up to 140 people could die from vaccine-preventable diseases.

Berkley said the situation was improving, with new guidance on how to carry out immunisation campaigns safely.

But he said locating all the children who missed out on vaccines before new outbreaks emerge will be a ""real challenge"".

Thursday's funding drive is for a five-year period in which the organisation aims to reboot halted programmes in the countries it supports -- allowing them to access vaccines at a much reduced cost -- with the goal of reaching some 300 million children.

Berkley said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that the target would be reached, with more new countries pledging donations despite the economic strains of the pandemic.

Recalling past episodes when vaccine work was stalled by the outbreak of diseases such as Ebola and SARS, another coronavirus, he urged nations to move beyond ""boom and bust"" cycles of crisis planning.

""I don't think this coronavirus is going to go away like SARS did,"" he said.

He also warned of an ""unprecedented"" level of rumour and conspiracy theory around vaccinations, particularly from the northern hemisphere.

""Distrust between people in their government, the rumours and the intentional spread of false information is not only at an all time high, but it also is being amplified by social media tools that didn't exist 20 years ago,"" he said.

It simply invited the three EU member states which currently belong to the UN’s Security Council – Britain, France and Ireland – to air their views about Baghdad’s non-compliance with its resolutions.

After a brief debate, the ministers agreed to reiterate their call on Saddam to allow international weapons inspectors back into the country and grant them unfettered access to sites they wish to visit. They also urged that every effort should be made to find a solution to the Iraqi situation within the UN Security Council.

The issue of whether the EU would support a military strike on the Gulf state was sidestepped, allowing the Danish presidency to put a positive spin on the meeting’s deliberations. “The consensus we had in August is still the consensus,” said Denmark’s Foreign Minister Per-Stig Møller. “We still say we must act through the Security Council.”

This view was echoed by Javier Solana. The EU’s foreign policy chief explained: “The UN route has to be continued. Europe is not divided on this point.”

Yet Europe was clearly divided on another point – as had been underscored the previous day. Speaking from the English seaside resort of Blackpool, British premier Tony Blair also committed himself to seeking a solution to the Iraqi crisis under the UN’s aegis. When pressed by a TV interviewer, though, he failed to rule out the prospect of the UK joining forces with the US in attacking Iraq, if efforts to have the arms inspection team led by Hans Blix returned to Iraq come to nought.

Many foreign ministers used the margins of Monday’s meeting to distance themselves from the gung-ho attitude of London and Washington towards Iraq. Sweden’s Anna Lindh remarked: “I can accept that Saddam Hussein is a terrible dictator but it is not the objective of the UN to get rid of him. The objective and the goal is to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction.”

Belgium’s Louis Michel warned that sabre-rattling against Baghdad could exacerbate Israeli-Palestinian tensions. “It is very dangerous not linking the situation in Iraq and the long, unresolved conflict in the Middle East,” he said.

His French counterpart Dominique de Villepin said Paris refused to give the UK and US “free rein for military action”.

Meanwhile, an opinion poll in Spain – one of the EU states offering the strongest backing for George W. Bush’s anti-Saddam front – indicates that José María Aznar’s government is out of step with public opinion. According to the daily El Pais, some 90% of Spaniards believe there should be no bombardment of Iraq. More than 80% of respondents said they didn’t wish Madrid to send soldiers to the Gulf if war is declared and 72% argued that Spain should not give logistical support to US bombers.

Germany’s opposition to US policy over Iraq is widely believed to have been a key factor in the success of the red-green coalition in last month’s election. In Ireland the issue of the country’s military neutrality is proving one of the main points of debate in the run-up to its second referendum on the Nice Treaty.

A new poll states that 52% of Irish people believe their government should oppose military action if a vote on the question arises in the UN Security Council during its stint there."

Scientists have copied a preservation method - used by plants in extreme environments - to protect vaccines from degenerating at air temperature. This will allow for cheaper and safer public health programmes, even in remote areas.

A British company called Cambridge Biostability was awarded a £950,000 government grant yesterday to help bring the invention to production.

""It is a similar technique to the process by which fossilised insects are trapped in amber and preserved for millions of years,"" said Bruce Roser, the company's scientific director, who has been working on stable liquid vaccines for five years and holds a number of patents.

John Oxford, professor of virology at Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry in London, said: ""There is a huge need for something like this.

""Vaccines are fragile and a lot of effort is put into trying to keep them cold. Anything that can stabilise them in normal conditions has great potential.

""There are inventions or developments that can appear at first to be small technological advances but turn out to have dramatic effects. If it works, this could be one of those.""

Twenty-seven million of the 132 million children born each year are not immunised with diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine, according to the World Health Organisation. In 2002, about 1.4 million died of diseases that could have been prevented by vaccines.

The cold-chain process of keeping vaccines at low temperatures from production to use costs the WHO up to £165 million per year. Vaccinating each child against the most common diseases costs about £16, so removing the need to refrigerate could save enough to treat another 10 million children.

The new method copies a technique used by plants in arid conditions, such as the resurrection plant, a fern that can survive for long periods in North American deserts. It is said that some such plants can remain in a desiccated state for over a century.

A sugar solution containing the vaccine is dried to form syrup and then solidifies. This traps the vaccine's molecules so that they they cannot chemically react.

The technique suspends tiny particles of water-soluble solidified sugar containing vaccine in an inert liquid. The vaccine is later released into the body when injected.

At present, up to half of all vaccines are wasted each year due to real or suspected temperature damage.

""If it takes off on a large scale, this is a revolutionary development,"" said Dr Roser at Cambridge Biostability.

""So many of the world's children are not immunised - not because the vaccines are not available, but because it is so expensive to transport and store them.""

He added: ""We have done trials with vaccines that have been shown to be stable for six months at 55°C, and the immune response has been at least as good as the traditional vaccines.""

The only vaccine his team has found that appears unsuitable for the technique is oral polio.

The method has been tested on four commercial vaccines and in animal trials. Yesterday's grant will be used to work with Panacea Biotech, an Indian company, to develop a five-in-one vaccine for children. It is hoped clinical trials on humans can begin within three years.

Hilary Benn, the Secretary of State for International Development, said: ""The widespread and effective use of vaccines has protected children in the UK against diseases such as measles, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough and diphtheria, and given parents peace of mind.

""We want to make this a reality for children and their parents in the developing world.

""This new British technology allows vaccines to be used in remote areas and at extreme temperatures, and will mean more children than ever before will have access to life-saving vaccinations."""

His cousin Thomas Maguire says he and John first developed an interest in Islam from what Maguire described in a website posting as the ""pseudo-Muslim murmurs within hip-hop music."" John already had an inkling about the faith. His mother took him, then 12, to see Spike Lee's film Malcolm X, and she says he was moved by a scene showing people of all nations bowing down to God. By his later teens, John was a conspiracy enthusiast: his Web wanderings covered ufos, the ""new world order,"" the Illuminati and the cia. He also sampled religions online and in the end was attracted to Islam. John frequented Islamic newsgroups and posted questions about the faith: Does the Koran forbid certain musical instruments? What would he have to give up to become a Muslim? (""Is it O.K.,"" he asked, ""to watch cartoons on TV?"") He tried to locate online hard-to-find books--on Islam, the Palestinian cause, the Freemasons. He sometimes signed off as ""Brother Mujahid""; his e-mail name, apparently a play on hip-hop monikers, was Hine E. Craque.

Years later, after Lindh's arrest in Afghanistan, quiet, affluent San Anselmo would be described sneeringly as a place for overindulgent hot-tubbers who let their kids do whatever they want. Locals prefer to call themselves tolerant. So when folks at, say, Bubba's Diner on San Anselmo Avenue would see the tall, awkward, teenage John strolling the streets in Islamic dress, they did not get especially worked up. It was just another kid experimenting with his life, with his spiritual side, certainly nothing to fear or loathe. ""He actually looked very lonely,"" recalls Elaine Scheeter, who owns Paper Ships, Books & Crystals, a store for spiritual pursuits. ""I got the impression that he did not fit in.""

But John was finding his place. He had become hooked on Islam and was searching for a place to pray. He visited the Redwood Mosque, a nearby prayer hall that sits on 22 acres of woodland grove. But he dismissed it as insufficiently orthodox. He later turned up at the Islamic Center of Mill Valley, a small mosque serving mainly South Asian immigrants on a tree-lined residential street not far from Highway 101. In late 1997 he was ready for commitment. He presented himself before two witnesses at the Mill Valley Mosque and declared the shahada, an affirmation of faith: ""I declare that there is no god except God, and I declare that Muhammad is the Messenger of God."" With that, he became a Muslim.

It was all foreign to the Roman Catholic Frank and Marilyn. They were attuned to matters of the spirit, particularly Marilyn, who was attracted to Native American rites. But they had little experience with Islam. Still, they were pleased to see that their son had found something that moved him. And at a time when other parents they knew were coping with their kids' experimentation with drugs, booze and fast driving, it all seemed fairly innocent. Marilyn would drop young John off at the mosque for Friday prayers. At the end of the evening, a fellow believer would drive John home."
660,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions various actors such as Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and the 4chan community.",True,The article discusses the actions of the 4chan community in creating and spreading pro-Trump memes.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article describes the pattern of the 4chan community creating and spreading pro-Trump memes.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Donald Trump’s presidency is well underway, but many observers are still trying to understand how he won the office in the first place. Plenty of explanations are circulating, from Hillary Clinton’s weaknesses as a candidate to pervasive sexism and class disenfranchisement in the Rust Belt. But whatever the truth, those who worked tirelessly on behalf of Trump have got what they were after.

A small subset of these campaigners is worth special attention. Not so much because of their political convictions but because of their unrestrained fervour to fulfil an ancient Egyptian prophecy involving Trump, a cartoon frog, and an online counterculture.

The story starts with the infamous online image board 4chan, which has been a weather-vane of internet subculture since its conception in 2003. 4chan is divided into sub-forums about topics ranging from video games and anime to politics. Users communicate largely through memes – images somehow grounded in pop culture and featuring a recurring character, figure or phrase. Around 2010, 4chan users began posting and reposting the image of a cartoon frog, Pepe. By 2015, his wrinkly, wide-eyed face had become a staple meme within the community.

The sub-forum “/pol/” caters to the internet’s extreme fringe: anarchists, communists, far-right extremists and white supremacists. /pol/ is 4chan’s second most popular sub-forum, and is one of the main forces that set the tone for online fringe political discussion.

Pepe the frog and /pol/ first collided with the outside world in June of 2015, when Trump announced his candidacy for president of the united states. Trump, with his aversion to “political correctness” and penchant for flair and showmanship, was /pol/’s immediate candidate of choice. And so, Pepe the frog was edited to wear a “Make America Great Again” hat, and began appearing in hundreds of Trump-supporting forum posts.

At that very time, an event of religious significance to /pol/ contributors was approaching.

Each post published on 4chan bears an identifying number, assigned consecutively by order of publication. Because of the huge number of posts published every day, this number is practically random. 4chan has an old tradition of users trying to have their posts obtain certain special numbers, known as “gets”. The most precious “gets” are round numbers (such as 1m) or those that repeat all their digits. By October of 2015, /pol/ was approaching its 77777777th post, seen to be of particular importance because the number 7 is often associated with good luck and fortune. The post that would “get” that number was sure to gain legendary status within the community.

As it happened, the 77777777th “get” was for the message “Trump will win”.

This sent /pol/ and the broader 4chan community into paroxysms of amazement and glee. To fulfil this prophecy, the sub-forum started an online campaign in support of Trump. Users on /pol/ believed that the best way they could help Trump’s chances of victory was by creating and spreading pro-Trump internet memes outside of 4chan. They called it the “meme war”: if they could expose regular social media users (“normies”) to as many pro-Trump memes as possible, Trump would forever dominate the online news cycle, giving him a better chance of winning the primaries and maybe even the presidency.

It was from this melting pot that the cult of Kek emerged.

The word “Kek”, originally a Korean onomatopoeia for a raspy laugh, had long been used on 4chan as a replacement for “lol” (laughing out loud). One day, a /pol/ contributor discovered that Kek is also the name of an ancient Egyptian frog god.

The similarities between Kek and Pepe were striking enough as it was, but Kek also has a female alter ego, or nemesis, that takes the form of a snake. This was quickly taken to symbolise Clinton, a universally reviled character within the /pol/ community. What’s more, to our modern eyes, the hieroglyphs supposedly used to write the name Kek in ancient Egyptian even strongly resemble a man sitting in front of his computer.

Some of this, incidentally, is simply incorrect. According to an Egyptologist we contacted, Kek – which perhaps fittingly means “darkness” in ancient Egyptian – is not in fact a frog god per se, but rather one of four male Egyptian gods who are usually depicted with frog’s heads. Their female counterparts are depicted with serpentine heads. The hieroglyphs on the frog statuette above actually spell “Heqet”, which is the real name of the Egyptian frog goddess often associated with fertility and procreation.

Historical inaccuracies notwithstanding, this series of coincidences proved too much for the 4chan community to ignore, and the cult of Kek was born. The frog-headed Kek became the father, Pepe the holy spirit, and Trump the son, sent to Earth to fulfil a divine destiny.

Kek’s followers busied themselves disseminating Pepe memes everywhere on the mainstream internet. The Clinton campaign mistakenly attributed their efforts to a Nazi-esque ideology, and declared Pepe a public enemy – a grave misunderstanding of online counterculture. Until then, Pepe had been a harmless meme on the mainstream internet, with celebrities like Katy Perry retweeting images of him; sudden demonisation by the Clinton campaign endowed the cult with a remarkable legitimacy.

Kek cultists and 4chan’s Trump followers flocked to vote in online post-debate polls, racking up huge Trump margins. Trump repeatedly cited these results as proof of his debating prowess, although the polls concerned allowed people to vote more than once. This allowed him to present a narrative of unstoppable victory, even in the face of what would normally have been campaign-destroying scandals.

What this saga means for the future role of the internet in political campaigning isn’t yet clear, but a precedent has been set: no matter how bizarre or misinformed, the collective power of tens of thousands of internet cultists appears to works wonders."

Craziness!

Followers of my Twitter feed know that I like to post absurd maps from time-to-time. These reflect nothing more than my (disturbed?) sense of humor. See:
• Best month of the year
• How long to wait for weather to change

The site fivethirtyeight.com runs a story every year describing the favorite Thanksgiving side dish by region of the country. I cringe every time I see their map. It's dumb, but not the worst. Maps of favorite things by state or region are subjective to begin with, but when the methodology is flawed, the results are meaningless.

As an absurdist commentary to the favorite Thanksgiving dish article (and map), I decided to make a map of favorite Thanksgiving Day pie by region. To make it as absurd as possible, I left out pumpkin and apple pies, assigned pecan pie to the northeast, picked obscure pies for other regions, and used bizarre regional boundaries. My expectation was that it would create a few laughs within the circle of people that follow me. A post like this would generally have several thousand views (impressions) and several hundred engagements. After posting the joke map of favorite Thanksgiving Day pie (late in the evening), I replied with a comment noting it was not based on actual survey data.

It seemed to garner a typical amount of interest in the beginning. By the morning, more and more people were ""triggered"" by the map. ""Who tf eats coconut cream pie!"", ""No self-respecting southerner would eat that s***."", and so on. It became clear that people were taking it seriously – and were greatly offended. While on the phone at work on a conference call, my phone started buzzing. My Twitter notifications were going crazy. Many people from Texas were aghast that key lime pie was shown for Texas and vehemently defended their pie honor. Clearly someone prominent had shared it. A little while later, I found out it was U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. He declared it Fake News.

Later in the day, and the following day, it received a lot of attention from Atlanta to Memphis to Chicago to Detroit. The theme from this second wave of interest was very different. A number of people noted the difference between what Caucasians and African Americans consider to be their favorite. This is a fascinating perspective that never occurred to me (note: I am Caucasian). Key lime pie and coconut cream pie were described as ""white"" in many of the comments. This makes sense, since key lime pie, in particular, is something typically ordered at restaurants, not made from scratch. People with substantial disposable income are more likely to order desert at a restaurant.

The theme though was outrage. How could this be? Who was surveyed? It's ridiculous! As of this writing, the ""Total Engagements"" is over 1.5 million. Over 75% of the people who saw the tweet in their feed ""engaged"" with it in some manner. Probably 95% of the people who commented or quote-tweeted it believed it to be real and wanted to voice their displeasure.

There's a famous book in the realm of geography called ""How to Lie with Maps."" It gives many examples of ways that policy makers have deceived the public by composing maps in ways that were intended to achieve certain policy goals. Showing the Soviet Union (in the 1950s) using a Mercator Projection to exaggerate its (menacing) size is the penultimate example. One thing the author really didn't explore is what would happen if people knowingly, intentionally just made stuff up and put it on a map.

We live in a time where a whole industry exists to make up stories. Pizzagate. Agenda 21. Jade Helm. The public is bombarded with truths, half-truths, lies, and everything in between. It is an incontrovertible fact that many stories online are 100% fiction. This is generally restricted to the world of words though.

Maps hold a special standing among the public. We tend to place very high value in maps as holders of accurate information. If it's in a map, it must be true, right? If I had tweeted a joke list of favorite pies by region, it would be very quickly ignored. Since it was in map form, it had an air of authenticity. This matters. As cartographers, we need to be cognizant of the power that maps have. What would happen if the President had a map made showing MS-13 gang members and knowingly, falsely put a bunch of big dots in states he needs to carry for reelection? People would go nuts. Armed posses would take to the streets almost immediately.

We cannot let maps, as a medium for communicating information, be co-opted by people with nefarious intentions. I pledge to do my part by clearly noting if a map is a parody in the future."

Host Jon Karl asked the secretary about reports of ISIS prisoners now set free, Kurdish citizens executed and thousands displaced because of what many say were caused by President Donald Trump’s decision to stand down US troops in the northern part of Syria to allow Turkey to invade.

Karl pushed Mnuchin on sanctions, which most thought the president had promised to enact when he claimed earlier in the week that he would “obliterate the Economy of Turkey” if they moved on the Kurds — allies who helped the US in its fight against ISIS.

“What are you waiting for?” Karl asked regarding sanctions.

Mnuchin replied: “We’re ready to go at a moment’s notice to put on sanctions.”

Again, Karl asked, “This is a rapidly deteriorating situation. What are you waiting for?”

But Mnuchin talked around the immediacy and repeated that the US could go ahead with sanctions “at a moment’s notice.”

Later in the interview, Karl brought up the president’s nonsensical assertion about the Kurds being absent during the invasion of Normandy. Trump made the remark earlier in the week while compromising his decision that allowed Turkey to make advances into the region. Before showing the clip of the president that went viral, Karl said, “I want to have you explain something to me about what the president said about this, this week.”

Karl then showed the video clip of the president and then incredulously asked Mnuchin, “What is he talking about? The Kurds, obviously, did not have a state back then. Did he expect the Kurds would be on Omaha Beach?”

Mnuchin tried to make sense of the president’s nonsense by saying that people who are being critical of Trump’s decision are attempting to push the notion that the Kurds are a longtime ally of the US. “Everybody is saying we are abandoning the Kurds, like the Kurds are these long-standing allies,” Mnuchin said.

The assertion by the president and Mnunchin that the Kurds are not long-standing allies of the US is absurd. As Bilal Wahab, a fellow at The Washington Institute, told NPR, “Anecdotally, there were Kurdish soldiers who fought the Nazis in Germany alongside the British army, for example.”

Wahab also noted that the Kurds and US have worked together since the early 1970s. “You can also go all the way back to 1971, 1974, where the Kurdish Peshmerga in Iraq were fighting Saddam Hussein’s regime, and the United States was arming them and supporting them in order to dissuade Saddam Hussein from falling into the Soviet orbit at the time,” Wahab said. “But of course, when Saddam Hussein finally came through, that support was lifted. So the Kurds talk about the history of American abandonment of them. But this one in particular stings in a special way.”

But Mnuchin, never one to let history or facts get in his way, went on to say that the US focus was not about defending land for the Kurds, but instead about defeating ISIS. But, this is also problematic since the results of the president’s decision have allowed ISIS supporters to escape prison."

It feels like it’s over with. But it’s actually just at the start in every country in some ways,” says Azra Ghani at Imperial College London of covid-19’s spread.

Her view is backed up by World Health Organization statistics, which show that the world experienced its highest daily jump in new confirmed coronavirus cases on 7 June, a record that has since been broken three more times. “Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening,” said WHO general secretary Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a press conference on 8 June.

The virus’s spread continues as the world rapidly approaches the grim threshold of half a million confirmed deaths, with 433,000 reported as of 15 June. The world passed the milestone of 8 million confirmed cases today.

The geographical burden of covid-19 is shifting. While the US is still worst affected, with more than 2 million cases and more than 100,000 deaths, it is now followed by Brazil, Russia and India, followed mostly by European countries. Peru has the eighth most cases, and the WHO has called South America the new epicentre of the epidemic. The Middle East’s share of global new cases has climbed too in the past fortnight. Cases in Africa are still relatively low, but are speeding up: reaching 100,000 took 98 days, but 200,000 just 18 days.

Worldwide, the average number of daily new confirmed cases in June has settled at a higher level than in May. However, David Heymann at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says deaths, rather than cases, are the gold standard for measuring transmission, despite reflecting events around two to four weeks ago. Unlike cases, global daily deaths are relatively static, averaging 4295 in June so far, versus 4619 in May.

Heymann, who led the WHO’s response to SARS in 2003, says the upward trend in cases could be a result of more testing and a reflection of countries’ different strategies. “It’s really apples and oranges in the same basket because some countries are doing additional testing for contact tracing and throwing positives into the basket, and other countries aren’t doing that,” he says.

The large number of new confirmed cases may be partly due to greater testing capacity and tracing efforts, says Ghani. But she suspects another reason they are ticking up is that many countries are beginning to emerge from lockdown. In some countries, such as Germany, there has been a slow increase in detected infections, while in others, including Iran, the increase has been faster, raising fears of a second peak. Some lockdown restrictions are now being reintroduced in Beijing, China, where 79 cases have been confirmed during the past four days.

A WHO spokesperson says: “The biggest threat we now face is complacency. All countries have unique epidemiological curves. Some that brought large outbreaks under control have seen flare-ups. Whether a flare-up becomes a second large outbreak is down to whether or not strong public health interventions are established.”

Ghani is particularly worried about low and middle-income countries that cannot sustain lockdowns and have weaker healthcare systems. Modelling she has done with colleagues projects deaths will accelerate across the next 28 days in Brazil, India, Pakistan, Russia and South Africa, along with many other countries.

Covid-19 now appears to be with us all for good, she says. “There’s been fantastic successes in New Zealand and Australia, and South-East Asia. But given the global spread, I think we have to consider it endemic now.”

Yet even though the coronavirus is widespread, the pandemic is at an early stage. The actions taken to control and limit the spread of the virus can still have a big effect on how many people will ultimately catch it.

An initial analysis by Ghani offers some hope that people are adapting in ways that mean second peaks of the virus aren’t inevitable.

Before lockdowns, movement patterns tracked using data from Google and elsewhere were a good predictor of new cases. But as some richer countries emerge from restrictions, the correlation between cases and movement has weakened, she has found, in as-yet unpublished work.

“Face mask wearing has become more widespread. When we start to move around, we’re probably staying a bit further apart from people, we’re not having the close contact, the handshaking. And maybe we’re avoiding contexts where transmission might occur,” says Ghani. “That’s a positive sign. If that’s sustained in coming weeks, it suggests we are learning a way to live with the virus.”"

During Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's last days in captivity, he enjoyed the small pleasures in life, like tending a garden of weeds and turning up the volume on Mary J. Blige songs, according to a new book written about the experiences of the American guards who watched him.

Will Bardenwerper's new book The Prisoner in His Palace: Saddam Hussein, His American Guards, and What History Leaves Unsaid, details a man who seems far-removed from the heartless dictator who's name is synonymous with pure evil.

Hussein wrote letters and even poetry for one guard's wife, and when he listened to the radio, “he’d always stop tuning if he stumbled across a Mary J. Blige song,"" the book says, the New York Post reported.

The book details the experiences and relationships American guards formed while watching over the dictator during a 2006 trial.

Hussein was charged in connection with the government's response to a botched assassination attempt in 1982 when his convoy was attacked as it drove through the mostly Shiite village of Dujail.

The government responded by razing orchards around the village and rounding up 148 villagers, who were sentenced to death.

In the book, the author notes that several of the guards had children and Hussein offered up his own out-there parenting stories, the Post reported.

Hussein reportedly said that after his violent son Uday shot up a party, Hussein taught him a lesson by burning a garage full of his son's Rolls-Royces and Ferraris.

“Laughing wildly, the former dictator recalled how he gleefully watched the inferno,” Bardenwerper wrote.

Hussein ruled Iraq for nearly a quarter-century before being toppled by a United States-led coalition in 2003. He was executed by hanging in December 2006.

On social media, some tweeted about Hussein's apparent taste for Mary J. Blige.

Wonder what his favorite song was?"

In foreshadowing an open-ended military and diplomatic offensive, secretary of state Colin Powell plainly expects unquestioning cooperation from all countries, great and small. This blunt message to all and sundry is: now we cut the crap. You are either for us or against us. We are going to win. Back us - or you, too, will lose.

These propositions demand urgent scrutiny - for despite Mr Bush's initial caution, here is the looming, daunting prospect of superpower unleashed, of Prometheus unbound. And America's friends must think hard and fast about what they are getting into. Did the world really change this week? For the American people, yes, without doubt. They discovered in the most awful fashion that they were vulnerable, en masse, to foreign enemies; and that their government could not protect them. For other nations that have long lived with terrorism, only the scale changed. But for Americans, the illusion of safety shattered. A culture of impunity in which US governments act abroad with little fear of direct consequences at home was smashed as utterly as Manhattan's doomed towers.

Is the US now justified in demanding unstinting support? Yes, but that support cannot be unthinking, too. It is incumbent upon Mr Bush to define the threat he would eradicate and the scope of the measures he might employ. The options in the shadowy world he is about to enter range from a full-scale, Gulf war-style mobilisation against Afghanistan to aerial attacks and special forces incursions. In prospect too, perhaps, is a return to Reagan era covert operations, snatch squads, secret funds, state subversion, and even political assassination. And as far as can be ascertained now, such activity may not be confined to crushing Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. This uncontained American campaign potentially leads to the very gates of Damascus, to Tehran and even more likely, to Saddam Hussein's Baghdad.

The danger that others will exploit America's war for their own purposes is also apparent. Russia, for example, says it is happy to help crush terrorists, especially the Chechen variety. Israel is already acting as if it had received a green light for intensified repression in the Occupied Territories. Pakistan, pivotal in any Afghan operation, will doubtless want a quid pro quo, perhaps over its links to Kashmiri terrorism. And what will China's price be? Silence on Tibet? In Washington, meanwhile, another woeful prospect is the predicted collapse of congressional opposition to Mr Bush's rogue-bashing missile defence plans.

That Nato, the UN, G8, and the EU have rallied to America's banner is only right. The US deserves every sympathy and should be supported in taking all reasonable measures to find and punish this week's culprits. But international institutions, like governments, have a broader duty in the dangerous days ahead to deflect and mitigate the wilder lunges of this wounded superpower. Whether they can do so, given America's present mood, will give us a first measure of Mr Bush's crusading new world."

Soros, who turns 81 next month, told outside investors in his $25 billion Quantum fund on Tuesday that he plans to continue to manage family assets while returning money to outsiders. The fund's co-deputy chairmen, Soros's sons Jonathan and Robert, said the action is being taken to avoid new U.S. financial regulations that would have forced the fund to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission by next March if it continued to manage outside assets.



Over the years, the elder Soros has transformed himself from a speculator who made $1 billion in 1992 betting that the Bank of England would be forced to devalue the pound, to one of the world's foremost philanthropists. He has given away more than $8 billion of his fortune to promote democracy and free speech, as well as improving education and fighting poverty around the world.



Soros has also become a financial fixture in U.S. political circles, frequently helping fund the campaigns of Democratic politicians and liberal causes.



Soros is a native of Hungary, studied at the London School of Economics after World War II and has lived in New York for decades."

The more members of a human ""herd"" who are immune to a given disease, the better protected the whole populace will be from an outbreak of that disease.

There are two ways an individual can become immune to an infectious disease: by becoming infected with the pathogen that causes it or by being vaccinated against it. Because vaccines induce immunity without causing illness, they are a comparatively safe and effective way to fill a community with disease-resistant people. These vaccinated individuals have protected themselves from disease. But, in turn, they are also protecting members of the community who cannot be vaccinated, preventing the chain of disease from reaching them and limiting potential outbreaks. Every vaccinated person adds to the effectiveness of this community-level protection.

What do thresholds have to do with herd immunity?

The microbes that cause disease all have different infectious features. Some, like measles and influenza, pass from person to person more easily than others. Some tend to have more severe consequences in specific demographic groups. For example, the symptoms of pertussis, or whooping cough, are distressing at any age but can be fatal in infants, the age group with the highest death rate from pertussis. Each of these features—such as transmissibility and severity—affects a given disease's threshold, or the minimum percentage of immune individuals a community needs to prevent an outbreak.

To set a threshold, epidemiologists—experts in infectious disease transmission—use a value called ""basic reproduction number,"" often referred to as ""R0."" This number represents how many people in an unprotected population one infected person could pass the disease along to. For example, R0 for measles is between 12 and 18, while for polio, it is between five and seve. The higher this number is, the higher the immunity threshold must be to protect the community. Because measles is extremely contagious and can spread through the air, for example, the immunity threshold needed to protect a community is high, at 95%. Diseases like polio, which are a little less contagious, have a lower threshold—80% to 85% in the case of polio."

Many U.S.-based startups with advanced reactor designs are backed by venture capitalists, not the U.S. government. Their impetus differs, too. Unlike American scientists of the 1950s and 19560s, who were locked in an atom-splitting Cold War race with the Soviet Union, they aim to combat climate change.

Nearly 50 startups working in the U.S. and Canada alone have raised more than $1.3 billion in private investment, according to a “Back to the Future” report in December by Third Way, a centrist think tank. The funding continues to increase.

How can this be? Conventional reactors, fueled by pellets of solid uranium oxide, use only 3 percent or 4 percent of uranium’s energy so the waste remains radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. But because Dewan’s reactor uses uranium in a liquid rather than solid form, it extracts 96 percent of the energy.

Yet building and maintaining nuclear power plants, even smaller ones, is costly. Low natural gas prices have made some of today’s aging U.S. plants uneconomical, prompting the closure of at least four in the last two years. (Read more about these closures.)

“They look great on paper but could be difficult to realize in practice,” he says of the advanced reactors. “A lot of projects in the past have led to disappointment.” He says reactors that don’t use the light-water design common in today’s nuclear power plants will need prototypes for testing and their private funds aren’t enough to cover the cost.

Next-gen nuclear is “absolutely doable,” says Russ Bell, senior director of new plant licensing for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group. He says many new reactor designs are safe and “extremely innovative,” but since they need to be prototyped, it will take 20 to 25 years to bring them to market.

“That sounds like a long time, but in our business, things take a while,” Bell says. For example, it could take a decade or more for the five reactors currently under construction in the U.S.—the first ones since Watts Bar Unit 1 went online in Tennessee in 1996—to go from licensing to commercial operation.

Will China Take the Lead?

China might be faster. Some U.S.-based companies are looking to China, which is rapidly expanding its use of nuclear power as a way to curb the air pollution that’s choking its cities. China currently ranks fifth in nuclear capacity, but it plans to more than double that amount soon. By 2020, it could rank third—after the U.S., still the world’s leader, and France.

Dewan says her company wants to build its molten salt reactor first in the U.S., if at all possible. She says the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is looking at advanced reactors, remains the world’s gold standard for licensing."
670,False,The article does not suggest any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions international hedge funds, George Soros, and the Netherlands' market watchdog as actors.",True,The article discusses trades made by hedge funds and the positions taken by George Soros's family office.,False,There is no mention of any threats in the article.,False,There is no indication of patterns being discussed in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"In an apparent technical snafu, the details of hundreds of trades by international hedge funds, including the one tied to legendary trader George Soros, were briefly disclosed by a Netherlands’ market watchdog Tuesday night, the Financial Times reported.

The details, which revealed positions going back to 2012, were quickly removed, the report said, but not before the newspaper and others saw a list of some of the short bets, which are wagers that the value of an asset will decline.

Among the previously unreported positions was a bet by Soros’s family office against Dutch bank ING ING, INGA, , a trade the FT said chimed with the billionaire’s publicly disclosed wager against German lending giant Deutsche Bank DBK, DB, . The ING short position was opened in June and increased to as much as 0.3% of the lender’s shares before being scaled back a month later, the data showed.

Shares of ING fell sharply in late June but have subsequently rallied. A spokesman for AFM, the country’s markets regulator, told the FT that it had made a mistake and moved quickly to correct it.

European market rules require hedge funds to report short positions to regulators, but only if they are more than 0.5% of the target company’s shares outstanding. Short bets can be part of a hedging strategy, offsetting other long positions. U.S. market regulators don’t require investors to reveal short positions, though long positions by certain large investors must be disclosed in filings after the end of each quarter.

Other trades revealed by the Dutch regulator included bets by the computer-driven Medallion fund ran by Renaissance Technologies, the U.S. hedge fund founded by mathematician James Simons. The list showed that the fund took out bets against small Amsterdam-listed companies since 2012, the report said.

Soros, the world’s richest hedge-fund manager, according to Forbes, rose to fame in 1992 as “the man who broke the Bank of England,” with a famous bet against the British pound, which was credited with leading to the currency’s devaluation and ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism.

Soros, 86, a major Democratic donor, saw his personal positions lose nearly $1 billion back in November as stocks rallied sharply in the wake of Republican Donald Trump’s election victory, thought the broader portfolio held by Soros Fund Management performed better, The Wall Street Journal reported. The firm manages around $30 billion for Soros and his family.

Soros has called Trump a “would-be dictator” and has predicted that uncertainty and disarray surrounding the new administration will eventually undercut global markets."

This time around, the Nader/LaDuke campaign raised millions of dollars. By running heavily on an anti-corporate platform, they were able to make the ballot in 44 states and capture 2.7 percent of the vote. Nader ran under the banner of the NACSGP and rejected the additional nomination of the Greens/Green Party USA.

Liberal Democrats who feared Nader would steal away votes from Democratic candidate Al Gore had urged Nader to drop out of the race early in the campaign. The party's response, however, was that Gore differed little from Republican candidate George W. Bush. They emphasized that their goal was to create a permanent third party in the U.S.

But when Gore lost to Bush by a mere (and much contested) 0.5 percent of the vote, many labeled Nader a spoiler. Critics argued that if he had not been there to attract the votes of registered Democrats, his 2.7 percent of the vote would have given Al Gore enough votes to defeat Bush.

Nader defenders, however, argue that the real spoilers in the 2000 election were the U.S. Supreme Court for allegedly allowing ""election manipulation"" by Florida Republicans, Al Gore for running a ""weak campaign"" and the Democratic Party itself for not properly suing or pushing for an investigation of the disqualification of 90,000 Florida voters [source: Green Party of the United States].

Despite Nader's 2.7 percent in the 2000 election, the party needed a full 5 percent of the national vote to become eligible for federal matching funds in the 2004 election. Still, Nader's campaign gained the Green Party additional exposure, pushing it ahead of the Reform party as a dominant third party in American politics.

Riding on this success, the NACSGP voted in 2001 to become a unified, national party, changing its name to the Green Party of the United States. This change attracted a large number of members away from the Greens/Green Party USA.

While both Green Parties are still active, the Green Party of the United States claims a larger membership and commands a greater presence among elected officials. Efforts to merge the two groups have been unsuccessful.

In the 2004 presidential election, Green Party General Counsel David Cobb won the party's presidential nomination while Nader ran as an independent candidate. Nader wound up with 1 percent of the popular vote. Cobb won 0.92 percent.

As of June 2007, the Green Party of the United States claimed 226 elected officials in 28 states. Moving toward the 2008 election, four Greens are currently seeking the party's nomination for president: Jesse Johnson of West Virginia, Green Party of Texas co-chair Kat Swift, former Georgia Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and California environmentalist Kent Mesplay. The party also continues to court Ralph Nader to run under the Green Party banner.

Presidential aspirations aside, the party continues to work to cement their role as a vital third party in the U.S. and not follow past notable third parties into obscurity by having their key views absorbed.

In an email to Clinton, Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, recounted a conversation she had while seated next to Soros at a dinner sponsored by the liberal major donor club called Democracy Alliance.

After Tanden informed Soros that she had worked for Clinton during her bitter 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination against Obama, Tanden wrote that Soros “said he's been impressed that he can always call/meet with you on an issue of policy and said he hasn't met with the President ever (though I thought he had). He then said he regretted his decision in the primary - he likes to admit mistakes when he makes them and that was one of them. He then extolled his work with you from your time as First Lady on.""

In 2012, The New Yorker reported that Soros felt snubbed by Obama after trying unsuccessfully to set up a White House meeting with the president. The two eventually met during “a low-profile, private meeting in New York, when the President was in town for other business,” according to the magazine.

Soros is now considered among Clinton’s most important major donors, having contributed $2 million to the pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC Priorities USA and American Bridge 21st Century in the first half of 2015."

After he witnesses the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump at the U.S. Capitol at noon, Obama will take his final flight aboard the presidential aircraft — it will no longer be Air Force One, as the sitting president will not be aboard — and begin recuperating from a tumultuous campaign season and intense transition that punctuated his presidency. He will enter a period of what he says will be silence and reflection with family.

“I want to do some writing,” he told reporters this week. “I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much. I want to spend precious time with my girls.”

Presidents historically have cloistered themselves immediately after leaving office, letting their successors establish themselves as the new commander in chief. The Obamas are not disclosing how long they plan to remain in Palm Springs nor whether the former president and first lady will stay in the Coachella Valley longer than their daughters, one of whom is still in high school.

Obama isn’t the first former president to get away to the vicinity of the historic Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, where he has taken several golf vacations and hosted foreign leaders over the past eight years; President Nixon retreated to Sunnylands after his resignation.

Obama has no plans to give interviews, the White House said, though he has said he will speak out as events demand it, particularly if the Trump administration moves to deport the 750,000 or so young adults who were brought into the U.S. illegally as children and whom Obama temporarily protected from deportation.

“The notion that we would just arbitrarily, or because of politics, punish those kids when they didn’t do anything wrong themselves, I think, would be something that would merit me speaking out,” Obama said.

Eventually, Obama will transition into his post-presidency career, which might be the most robust of any former president in the modern era. Obama has loosely outlined his plans for friends and close aides, several of whom will work with him either at his foundation, presidential library or personal office.

In the final days of his presidency, Obama talked about a return to the ideals of his early community organizing with the worldwide reach of a former president — as “global organizer,” as one friend called it.

Obama plans to help motivate a new generation of leaders at every level of government, though with a different approach as a global leader than the one he took as a grass-roots community organizer.

A close aide, David Simas, left the White House at the end of the year to become chief executive of the Obama Foundation, with a board of directors run by Obama’s close friend Marty Nesbitt. Part of the foundation’s responsibility is to build the Obama library on the South Side of Chicago, including programming, training, storytelling and interactive experiences.

Their first task is to raise money for the library and its museum. Officials haven’t disclosed a funding target, but the George W. Bush Presidential Library and endowment broke records with more than $500 million raised.

Obama may eventually enter into partnerships with the East-West Center, an education and research organization based in Honolulu, and with his alma mater, Columbia University in New York.

“He’s very optimistic about our future,” said Valerie Jarrett, a close family friend and longtime advisor.

Obama also hopes to keep up his regular contact with Trump, offering advice and counsel if he seeks it, or simply a word of empathy. Obama has often remarked on the change that set in when he was elected, the responsibility that appeared in the form of the decorated military officer who carries the nuclear launch codes who was never more than a few paces away.

Obama is not going to be the voice of opposition to Trump, aides agreed.

“President Obama is enormously grateful President Bush gave the president space to do his job when he took office, and he’ll do the same for President Trump,” said Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz. “President Obama won’t weigh in on the day-to-day churn of Washington, but if there’s something that’s counter to what he believes America stands for, he might consider speaking out.

Obama’s exact scope of influence is still taking shape, said one friend.

Right now, the friend said, Obama is contemplating “what this time means in the greater arc of history.”

Some of Trump’s plans only sound new. Others are downright revolutionary

He revealed that after a daring raid by U.S. forces into Pakistan, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was dead. ""Justice has been done,"" Obama assured the nation [source: Baker, et al.].

While the Navy SEAL team that cornered and killed bin Laden became national heroes, another unheralded group played a crucial role in the successful mission. For months leading up to the raid, staffers from the National Security Council (NSC) had organized more than two dozen meetings involving multiple government agencies. At those gatherings, officials analyzed emerging intelligence, studied possible operational courses of action and tried to figure out what the international consequences would be if the mission succeeded — or if it failed [source: Rasmussen].

On April 28, 2011, Obama had convened an NSC meeting in the Situation Room, a section of the White House West Wing equipped with giant TV screens and communications gear to relay the latest intelligence information from all over the world. In attendance were the NSC's principals, including National Security Adviser Tom Donilon, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others. Obama went around the table, asking each adviser for an opinion on the raid, and weighed that information. The next day, he gave the order to proceed [source: Allison].

The bin Laden raid was the sort of high-stakes moment for which the NSC was created by Congress back in 1947 [source: U.S. Dept. of State]. When a president has to take action, it's crucial to have well-researched policy options on the table, and experts and advisers who can help him pick the best one. Once the decision has been made, it's vital to have someone coordinating the government's various departments and agencies to make sure they work together to achieve it.

At least that's how it's supposed to work. While the NSC is a permanent part of the executive branch, each president has considerable leeway to organize the advisory group, and shape it to suit his own leadership style and personality. And some commanders-in-chief do a better job of using the NSC than others. In this article, we'll look at the history of NSC and how it has functioned over the decades."

The Morning Consult and Politico released their National Tracking Poll this week which showed that most of the participants were not impressed with Trump's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.

When asked whether Obama or Trump would be a better leader during the coronavirus pandemic, 52 percent of the participants said Obama, versus 38 percent for Trump.

But 44 percent said the president trumped Biden (who received 36 percent) when they were asked to choose between the two, while 20 percent of people couldn't decide.

When asked who they trusted more to handle issues like the coronavirus pandemic, 40 percent of people said Biden would be a better choice, while 39 percent opted for Trump.

Forty-two percent of people said the president managed the outbreak poorly, whilst 50 percent of respondents felt both the Trump administration and Congress were not doing enough in response to the outbreak.

Trump has received some praise for his leadership during the pandemic, including from Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the Infectious Disease Institute, who applauded his move to place a travel ban on China and Europe.

More people felt that Congressional Democrats and Congressional Republicans had addressed the outbreak poorly - but they said Congress as a whole had done a ""Fair"" job.

The World Health Organization (WHO) were also given a ""Good"" rating (35 percent) for their handling of it, despite being criticized by White House officials for being too sympathetic towards China.

The CDC was also ranked ""Good"" (40 percent) for how they addressed the killer bug while state governors received the same positive rating.

In fact, half of the respondents said they trusted their state government more to handle the pandemic in comparison to the Feds.

The government fell short in approval ratings when it came to testing, managing the spread, developing treatments, vaccine development, equipping hospitals, ensuring all Americans have access to healthcare.

But more people felt they had risen to the occasion when it came to providing financial support to people and businesses impacted by the virus.

Half of the participants felt that neither the federal government or Congress are not doing enough in response to the coronavirus outbreak but ""Strongly Approved"" of the $2 trillion stimulus package.

Nearly half of the people who took part feel Congress should pass another stimulus package immediately.

The majority ranked healthcare supplies as a ""top priority"" for the Trump administration to invest in (84 percent), followed by a vaccine (82 percent); purchasing more tests (73 percent); unemployment benefits (63 percent); supporting small business (54 percent); and supporting state and local governments (51 percent).

Investing in infrastructure was ranked as ""an important, but lower priority,"" in addition to supporting industries.

The vaccination rates in affected communities were well below the numbers needed to create “herd immunity” and protect individuals who could not safely be immunized.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, is also on a frightening overall rise, both in cases and resulting deaths, especially in the last decade. In 1976, there were as few as 1,010 reported cases. But in 2012, the most recent peak year reported by the C.D.C., there were 48,277 cases (the largest number since the mid-1950s) and 18 deaths, almost all affecting infants. Half of babies with pertussis require hospitalization.

I’ll spare you further harrowing examples of complications that can accompany vaccine-preventable diseases. Suffice it to say that health professionals need to do a better job of countering the resistance of parents who refuse recommended immunizations for their children. While vaccination critics have existed for as long as there have been vaccines, the problem of widespread resistance in this country began with a 1982 documentary alleging adverse reactions to the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine that minimized its benefits.

Then, 25 years later, the anti-vaccine movement was magnified by a falsified and later discredited report suggesting that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was causing an epidemic of autism. Further fueling vaccine resistance was parental concern that administration of multiple vaccines at one time to very young children was hazardous despite expert reassurance to the contrary.

As one specialist, Chephra McKee, told me, “Spreading out the vaccines means having to bring babies to the doctor or clinic multiple times, poking them over and over again and exposing them unnecessarily to sick children in the waiting room.”

So what now can be done to improve immunization rates? Dr. McKee, doctor of pharmacy at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, wants health providers to be more open and willing to speak to parents about their vaccine concerns. Too often, she said, parents have told her “No one wants to listen to me about why I’m reluctant to vaccinate my child.”

For parents worried about the safety of vaccines, Dr. McKee said health providers should be educating them about the benefits of immunizations and risks involved in refusing to vaccinate their children."

As measles outbreaks rage in a number of states across the country, President Trump urged families to vaccinate their children on Friday.

“They have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House. “This is really going around now. They have to get their shots.”

The endorsement of vaccination from a previously vaccine-questioning president comes as a bit of a surprise. Before winning the presidency, Trump several times alleged there was a link between the number of vaccines children get in early infancy and the development of autism.

But since his inauguration, Trump has made no public comment about vaccines at all.

With the measles count in the United States hitting its highest point since 1994 this week, public health observers have questioned why this president, unlike predecessors going back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hasn’t been urging parents to vaccinate their children.

Some raised concerns that Trump’s track record on vaccination would undercut the credibility of any pro-vaccination message he delivered. But others noted that his base voters might be swayed if he endorsed vaccines.

“To me, this is one of the best things President Trump has done,” said Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of the history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, who called out Trump publicly on his silence in a recent op-ed published in the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Zimmerman called the move “politically brave,” noting there is an anti-vaccine faction within his base.

“I hope my fellow liberals will take a break from lambasting the President and congratulate him. Whatever his other wrongs, he was dead right about this,” Zimmerman said.

On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that reported measles cases in the country had hit 695, the highest number since before measles was declared in eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. Cases have been reported from 22 states.

The president’s comments were welcomed by Dr. Matt Zahn, the chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s public health committee, who suggested they could be helpful in winning over parents who worry about the safety of vaccines.

“It’s just so important that there’s clarity here,” said Zahn, who is medical director for the communicable diseases program for Orange County Public Health in California. “You are safer and the public will be healthier when our kids are getting immunized and when our community immunization rates go up.”

Orange County is home to Disneyland, the epicenter of a big measles outbreak in 2015. Working to contain it was an enormous amount of work, Zahn said.

He said there is a fear among public health officials that the ground is now shifting. Where in recent years U.S. measles numbers have been driven by one or two large outbreaks — among Amish communities in Ohio in 2014, Disneyland in 2015 — this year there are multiple large outbreaks around the country.

“It feels different,” Zahn said, noting that even counties like his that aren’t currently battling a measles outbreak are finding themselves having to chase down contacts who were exposed elsewhere. “There is an awful lot of spillover to other communities and to other counties.”

“I think for all of public health, we’re all a little apprehensive that we’re reaching a new normal wherein every community deals with these events or cases or outbreaks on a semi-regular basis,” he said.

And with a growing number of pockets across the country where vaccination rates are low, the U.S. is likely to find itself having to fight ever larger outbreaks when unvaccinated Americans get infected abroad and return home sick, or when infected tourists bring the virus to the country.

“We certainly have … communities of significant size in this country where immunization rates are quite low,” Zahn said. “So the ground in the United States is more fertile for these outbreaks than it has been in decades past.”"

Harvard researchers say satellite images show an increase in traffic outside five hospitals in the Chinese city from late August to December.

The traffic spike coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like ""cough"" and ""diarrhoea"".

China said the study was ""ridiculous"" and based on ""superficial"" information.

It is believed that the virus first appeared in China some time in November. Authorities reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 31 December 2019.

""Clearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic,"" Dr John Brownstein, who led the research, told ABC news.

The study has not been peer-reviewed.

What did the study show?

The researchers examined commercial satellite data from outside five Wuhan hospitals, comparing data from late summer and autumn 2018 to the same time period in 2019.

In one case, researchers counted 171 cars parked at one of Wuhan's largest hospitals, Tianyou Hospital in October 2018.

Satellite data from the same time in 2019 showed 285 vehicles in the same place, an increase of 67%.

A surge in online searches for words associated with the symptoms of coronavirus on the Chinese search engine Baidu seemed to emerge at the same time.

""This is all about a growing body of information pointing to something taking place in Wuhan at the time,"" Dr Brownstein told ABC.

""Many studies are still needed to fully uncover what took place and for people to really learn about how these disease outbreaks unfold and emerge in populations. So this is just another point of evidence.""

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed the findings at a press briefing on Tuesday.

""I think it is ridiculous, incredibly ridiculous, to come up with this conclusion based on superficial observations such as traffic volume,"" she said.

What are the implications of the study?

The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says there were limits on the data set used by researchers - for example, they could not always compare satellite images taken on the same day in consecutive years due to cloud cover in some of the photos.

But if the infection was present - undetected perhaps - some people could have been leaving Wuhan and travelling abroad and that fits with some of the other evidence we have begun to see in other parts of the world suggesting early cases of Covid-19, our correspondent says.

However it may be unfair to use the study as evidence of a cover-up or delay in China's response, because with a previously unknown illness taking root in a community it is quite possible that there was some undetected spread before it was noticed officially, our correspondent adds.

China reported pneumonia cases with an unidentified cause to WHO on 31 December 2019.

Nine days later, Chinese authorities revealed they had detected a novel coronavirus (later named Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19) in several of the pneumonia cases.

Wuhan and other Chinese cities went into lockdown on 23 January 2020.

The WHO declared Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency of Global Concern on 30 January 2020 - this followed 82 confirmed cases outside China.

The precise events around the virus timeline are still unclear, more than six months on. The first known cluster of cases in Wuhan in December 2019 was centred around a local seafood market, which also sold live animals, including wildlife.

Tests suggest the virus was present in some form, but not all cases were connected with the market and no animal source has been pinned down. Evidence has since emerged suggesting the virus might have been circulating earlier, including from a French doctor who said his patient tested positive for coronavirus in late December.

Now there is an intriguing new clue, gleaned not from direct evidence, but from studying satellite imagery and internet search terms, which suggest hospital traffic and internet searches for symptoms were on the rise in Wuhan as early as late summer/early autumn.

Only further research into the virus, both in animals and humans will give an answer, although it is possible we will never know exactly where and when it emerged."

He has been dubbed the would-be ""MAGA bomber"" in a nod to Trump's Make America Great Again campaign slogan. Here’s what you need to know about the targets and the devices sent to them.

Who is the MAGA bomber suspect?

Authorities snared Sayoc, 56, earlier today in Plantation, Florida before cops searched his van which was covered in stickers supporting the US President.

Investigators reportedly used DNA to track the suspect, reports the New York Post.

Sayoc is understood to be a strip club owner and bodybuilder who was born in New York.

It was reported he has a registered Republican in Florida with a lengthy criminal history

Public records showed Cesar Sayoc has been arrested numerous times over the years for domestic violence, theft and other charges, according to Reuters.

In one case, court records show he was convicted on a charge of threatening to “throw, place, project or discharge any destructive device.”.

Images believed to be from Facebook have emerged of the terror suspect attending rallies supporting the President Donald Trump.

The account has “liked” more than 100 conservative pages, including several anti-Clinton and pro-Trump groups.

The bodybuilder former stripper was caught because of a single fingerprint, the director of the FBI revealed.

Following his arrest, officers were seen inspecting a van covered in political slogans including stickers showing Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama – both of who were pipe bomb targets – with crosshairs on their faces.

In court, his attorney Ronald Lowy described him as a ""sick individual"".

He said Sayoc was left by his dad and “has told his mother that he hates her”, but found salvation in supporting Trump.

“This was someone lost, he was looking for anything and he found a father in Trump,” Lowy added.

Sayoc even distanced himself from his Filipino father and Italian mum by claiming to be Native American, Lowy says.

He added: “He doesn’t seem to recognise reality. He lives in a fantasy world.

“The signs of mental illness are clearly there.”

Lowy, who has represented Sayoc in four prior criminal cases, said the suspect “doesn’t live life in a normal way.”

He said: “You talk to him and he speaks like a 15-year-old, like a child.

“This seems like such a sophisticated crime, I have trouble believing he had the mental capacity to create operating bombs.”

Who has been sent the suspect packages?

October 22: The first crude bomb to be discovered was delivered Monday to the suburban New York compound of George Soros.

The liberal billionaire and major contributor to Democratic causes and has called Trump's presidency ""dangerous.""

October 23: A similar package addressed to Hillary Clinton was intercepted on its way to Chappaqua, New York, where she lives with former President Bill Clinton.

October 24: A third package, addressed to former President Barack Obama, was intercepted early in the morning in Washington DC.

The New York office of CNN's was evacuated later that morning after a suspected bomb was sent to their mailroom.

It was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan who is a vocal critic of Mr Trump and was scheduled to appear on the network that day.

Later that day former Attorney General Eric Holder and Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters were also sent suspected explosive devices.

Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York was also sent one.

October 25: A package was addressed directly to Robert De Niro at his Tribeca Grill restaurant and had the same return address as all the other packages sent out containing pipe bombs.

Two further suspicious devices had been sent to former Vice-President Joe Biden in Delaware, the FBI said.

October 26: It emerged US police are investigating a suspicious package addressed to Democrat senator Cory Booker in Florida, which authorities said was similar to others that have been seized.

Another was addressed to the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, care of CNN.

What do we know about the devices?

The FBI said the crude PVC pipe bombs sent in manila envelopes with bubble wrap, marked with printed address labels and six ""Forever"" postage stamps.

They had return address of Florida Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee

The bombs seized each with a small battery, were about six inches long and packed with powder and broken glass, according to a law enforcement official who viewed X-ray images.

""So far the devices have been what appear to be pipe bombs,"" said FBI agent Bryan Paarmann.

Law enforcement officials said the devices which were wrapped in black tape, were not rigged like a booby-trapped package bomb that would explode on opening.

They had timers and batteries but never went off and officials are still uncertain whether the devices were poorly designed or never intended to cause physical harm.

What has he been charged with?

Sayoc is facing being slapped with five charges including mailing explosives and threatening ex-presidents.

He could receive up to 48 years in prison if convicted.

Following his arrest, Twitter and Facebook accounts in the name of Cesar Altieri and Cesar Altieri Randazzo respectively, believed to be used by the suspect, have been taken down."

Worse yet, it’s now testing psychological and technical support at 50 for the fourth time in 13 months, raising odds for a breakdown that brings the deep December 2018 at 42.36 into play.

As a consumer, you might think that cheap crude oil prices are great for the economy and your family’s bottom line. However, the contract is a highly-cyclical instrument that tracks economic expansion and contraction with surprising accuracy. Right now, the selloff is waving a red flag, telling us that energy traders are worried that world economies will enter recessionary waves as a result of China’s isolation and the potential escalation into other parts of the world.

More importantly from a technical standpoint, a decline into the 2018 low will mark the next phase in a massive 17-year descending triangle pattern, with support at the 2009 low in the lower 30s. The contract last tested that critical level in early 2016, breaking down into the mid-20s before reversing gears and remounting broken support. It’s failed to post a higher high in the last 4 years, maintaining a secular downtrend that’s now entered its 12th year.

Climate activists may view crude oil’s decline as a positive development, with more industries moving away from fossil fuels and into carbon-neutral energy sources. However, it’s unlikely that paradigm shift has reached critical mass, given healthy demand as a result of the multiyear economic expansion. In addition, dwindling crude oil resources around the world in coming years is likely to generate a premium for the commodity, with remaining users forced to pay up due to lower supply.

Fortunately, the evolution of crude oil prices has been moving at a snail’s pace, telling market players there’s plenty of time to take action if exposed to the industry through energy stocks or the futures markets. However, as we learned in 2008, contract volatility can escalate rapidly in response to system shocks like that year’s economic collapse, so it makes sense to keep a watch on price action at all times.

The contract soared from the mid-teens into the lower 40s in just 4 months in 1990, driven higher by the first Iraqi invasion. It settled back to earth a few months later, reentering a multiyear trading range that broke to the upside once again in 2004 when world economies were getting back on the feet after the burst Internet bubble. The uptrend went parabolic in 2006, driven by heavy speculation as a result of China’s multi-trillion dollar industrial expansion.

A vertical plunge followed 2008’s all-time high at 147.47, dropping the contract into a test at breakout support in the first quarter of 2009. It made steady progress into 2011, finally reversing a few points under the .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level. That marked the highest high in the last 9 years, ahead of a broad trading range that broke to the downside in 2014. That selloff printed the first lower monthly high for the contract in more than two decades.

The decline found support at the 2009 low at the start of 2016, giving way to a healthy uptick that stalled after President Trump fired the first shot of the trade war in 2018. It printed the second lower high in 7 years at that time, turning south at the .50 retracement of the 2-year slide. This downturn found support in the low 40s at the end of the year but the contract failed to make headway in 2019 and may be headed into a critical test at the 2016 low.

The WTI crude oil contract may have entered the next phase of a massive descending triangle pattern that forecasts much lower prices in coming decades.

""Fairly I'd have to say it's an 'F,'"" Klain said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

President Donald Trump has touted his administration's actions on the coronavirus, often pointing to a Jan. 31 order restricting travel from China as evidence of its early, aggressive approach to limiting the spread.

But Klain pushed back on the notion that imposing severe travel restrictions was an adequate response, arguing it was only a ""partial ban.""

Klain said he did believe the Trump administration's late January restrictions ""bought us some time"" to prepare for the disease's global spread. ""But we squandered that time,"" he said.

""What we're living with now in this country, the virus was created by nature, but the failed response was created by decisions we made,"" Klain said.

Klain, an attorney who oversaw the Obama administration's response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa from 2014 to 2015, argued that other countries responded more adequately than the U.S. and therefore better contained the spread. He said South Korea and Singapore are examples of nations that responded well.

""If you look at the countries that have been most successful, they used the time they got, from the time they knew the virus was coming until the time it came, to ramp up testing, to ramp up hospitals, to ramp up gear, to ramp up [personal protective equipment],"" he said.

""We didn't do any of those things. We sat around and spent those two months sitting around saying, 'It's not going to be here. Fifteen cases, it's going to go to zero, so on, so forth,"" he said.

Klain said the administration's response to the coronavirus has improved recently.

""But we're going to pay a huge price for squandering January, squandering February, squandering even a little bit of March,"" he said.

White House spokesman Judd Deere pushed back against Klain's comments, noting the Obama administration received its share of criticism for how it handled the Ebola outbreak. Judd wrote that it was ""ironic"" for Klain to play ""Monday-morning-quarterback"" over how the Trump administration has responded to COVID-19.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase U.S. testing capacity and speed up vaccine development, issued strict guidelines to restrict large gatherings, which helps to limit person-to-person transmission, and championed relief measures to soften the economic damage created by the disease.

Those efforts include supporting cash payments to Americans, as well as moving the tax deadline from April 15 to July 15.

""As the President said last week, we are using the full power of the federal government and working in partnership with the private sector for this all-of-America effort, and he has no higher priority than the health and safety of the country,"" Deere wrote in an email.

Trump, who also restricted travel from Europe, said Tuesday he had believed the coronavirus was a pandemic ""long before it was called a pandemic.""

But in Jan. 22 interview on CNBC, Trump claimed the virus was ""totally under control"" and said he was not worried about the disease becoming a pandemic.

The first person in the U.S. who was confirmed to have the virus was a traveler from China. The positive diagnosis came on Jan. 21, one day before Trump's comments to CNBC.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has sickened at least 247,000 people across the globe since it originated in China in late December.

There are more than 14,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. as of Friday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 200 people have died."

Actually, Elvis’ only Grammy awards were for his gospel music, winning best sacred performance in 1967 and best inspirational performance in 1972 and 1974.

Today, two of his Bibles – his personal Bible and one gifted to him by a fan that he held onto through the years – are part of the collection at the Museum of the Bible, in Washington, D.C.

Even though the museum is currently closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, that's not stopping one of the curators from opening up about what's inside.

Amy Van Dyke, the museum's lead curator of art and exhibitions, shared the story about the first time she held Elvis' personal Bible.

She said she could tell it was ""something special to him"" by all the notes in the margins.

CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SPURS RECORD BIBLE PURCHASES: ‘PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR HOPE’

""His favorite book, from what it looks like, was the book of Psalms,"" she shared. ""Because in the book of Psalms there's a lot of notations and writings in there, which makes sense because it's a book of songs. So for a musician, it made a lot of sense.""

She added, ""And in the back of that Bible, there's also some writing and some stanzas that he's written in there and poems and other things that really spoke to him.""

The other of his Bibles housed at the museum was gifted by a fan, Pat Hyder of Cowpens, S.C., on Feb. 20, 1977, and she wrote her address inside.

Dr. Jeffrey Kloha, chief curatorial officer at the museum, told Fox News it's no surprise the King spent so much time in the book of Psalms.

“Musicians have always found inspiration in the Psalms,"" Kloha said. ""Like Elvis, J. S. Bach, for example, wrote notes in his Bible throughout the Psalms. This is because the Psalms themselves are intended to be sung, and have been sung in churches and synagogues for centuries.”

X-rays can also be used to examine organs and identify problems. For example, an X-ray can highlight a lung infection, such as pneumonia.

They are also often used by surgeons during therapeutic procedures, such as a coronary angioplasty, to help guide equipment to the area being treated.

X-rays are a type of radiation. They're similar sources of energy to light. However, light has a much lower frequency than X-rays and is absorbed by your skin. X-rays have a higher frequency and pass through the human body.

As X-rays pass through the body, energy particles called photons are absorbed at different rates. This pattern shows up on the X-ray images.

The parts of your body made up of dense material, such as bone, show up as clear white areas on an X-ray image. The softer parts, such as your heart and lungs, show up as darker areas.

X-rays are carried out by radiographers, who are healthcare professionals trained to use imaging technology, including X-ray machines, computerised tomography (CT) scanners and ultrasound scanners. Some specialist radiographers are also trained to make a diagnosis from the examination.

During an X-ray, you'll be asked to lie on a table or stand against a flat surface so that the part of your body being examined is positioned between the X-ray machine and an imaging plate.

The X-ray will last for a fraction of a second. As the X-rays hit the imaging plate, the plate will capture a snapshot of the image.



The image will then be transferred to a computer so that a radiologist or radiographer can study them and produce a report. Radiologists are doctors who are specially trained to carry out examinations and interpret medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans.

Exposure to high levels of radiation can be very harmful. However, the X-rays used for medical purposes are safe because the dose of radiation is very small.

People are often concerned about being exposed to radiation during an X-ray. However, everyone is exposed to sources of natural radiation throughout their life.

Natural radiation is sometimes known as background radiation. Sources of background radiation include:
• radon – a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in low levels in the atmosphere.
• cosmic rays – a type of radiation that originates from space (from the sun and stars).
• the earth – soil and rocks contain various radioactive materials that have been present since the earth was formed; these contribute to our exposure, as do building materials made from soil, rocks and stones.
• food and water – for example, nuts, bananas, red meat and potatoes all contain tiny traces of radiation.

Being exposed to X-rays carries a theoretical risk of triggering cancer at a later date, as does exposure to background radiation.



However, this risk is very low. For example, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has calculated that:
• an X-ray of your chest, teeth, arms or feet is the equivalent of a few days' worth of background radiation, and has a less than 1 in 1,000,000 chance of causing cancer.
• an X-ray of your skull or neck is the equivalent of a few weeks' worth of background radiation, and has a 1 in 100,000-1,000,000 chance of causing cancer.
• an X-ray of your breasts (mammogram), hip, spine, abdomen or pelvis is the equivalent of a few months' to a year's worth of background radiation, and has a 1 in 10,000-100,000 chance of causing cancer.

Two doses of the HPV vaccine are recommended for all boys and girls at ages 11–12; the vaccine can be given as early as age 9. If you wait until they’re older, they may need three doses instead of two.

Children who start the vaccine series on or after their 15th birthday need three shots given over 6 months. If your teen hasn’t gotten the vaccine yet, talk to his/her doctor about getting it as soon as possible.

Teens and young adults should be vaccinated too.

HPV vaccination is also recommended for everyone through age 26 years, if not vaccinated already.

Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults age 27 through 45 years who are not already vaccinated may decide to get HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination. HPV vaccination in this age range provides less benefit, as more people have already been exposed to HPV.

HPV infections and cervical precancers (abnormal cells on the cervix that can lead to cancer) have dropped significantly since the vaccine has been in use.
• Among teen girls, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 86 percent.
• Among young adult women, infections with HPV types that cause most HPV cancers and genital warts have dropped 71 percent.
• Among vaccinated women, the percentage of cervical precancers caused by the HPV types most often linked to cervical cancer has dropped by 40 percent.

Like any vaccine or medicine, HPV vaccination can cause side effects. The most common side effects are mild and include:
• Pain, redness, or swelling in the arm where the shot was given
• Dizziness or fainting (fainting after any vaccine, including HPV vaccine, is more common among adolescents)

The benefits of HPV vaccination far outweigh any potential risk of side effects.

The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program helps families of eligible children who might not otherwise have access to vaccines. The program provides vaccines at no cost to children ages 18 years and younger who are uninsured, Medicaid-eligible, or American Indian/Alaska Native. To learn more, see VFC program."

The space agency will launch a Terrier-Improved Malemute sounding rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility on the Delmarva Peninsula that will deploy colorful vapor tracers. Skywatchers from New York to North Carolina may be able to catch a glimpse of the colorful tracer clouds lighting up the night sky in blue-green and red.

As Rhett Jones at Gizmodo reports, the rocket will release ten canisters, each about the size of a soda can, around five minutes after launch. This equates to an altitude between 96 and 124 miles above Earth. The canisters will release barium, strontium and cupric-oxide, forming colored clouds that researchers can visually monitor and track from the ground, which could help them understand the movements of particles in the ionsphere and aurora.

According to NASA, the mission, which is also a test of a new canister ejection system, was originally scheduled for May 31, but the experiment requires precise weather conditions, so it was scrubbed four times during the first week of June. A launch scheduled for yesterday was postponed because boats were present in the region where the 670-pound payload is expected to drop in the water.

While the heat wave that hit the East Coast over the weekend might not be great for barbecues, it is perfect for the rocket launch. “The area of high pressure responsible for the heat wave in the eastern U.S. will also promote clear skies through next week, which will bode well for the NASA launch,” says AccuWeather Meteorologist Faith Eherts.

This is by no means the first time NASA has lit up the night with vapor tracers. In fact, according to the agency, it has used sounding rockets to release vapor tracers in the upper atmosphere since the 1950s to understand the near-space environment.

But before you grab your tinfoil hat, know that the tracer experiments pose no dangers to life on the ground. According to NASA, the metals used are among those common in firework displays. But for the tracer experiments, the metals are released in much lesser amounts.

The sounding rocket program fills the gap between regions of the atmosphere that are too low for satellites to sample but too high for conventional aircraft to reach. While scientists do a lot of theoretical modeling of how particles in this region of the atmosphere move and interact, the vapor tracing allows them to check their assumptions.

The vapor tracers light up as they interact with ionized or neutral particles in the atmosphere, making the movements of these particles visible. Different types of tracers light up in the presence of diferent particles.

For instance, when barium, which is being used in tonight’s launch, is exposed to sunlight it ionizes rapidly and glows purple-red. Watching the dance of the barium clouds could provide information about how charged particles move in the ionosphere. But barium that is not ionized, which can be enhanced with the addition of strontium or lithium, can also be used to track neutral particles. Lithium alone can also be used to track neutral winds and can actually be used during daylight to track emissions, but glows a bright red at night.

For anyone interested in getting a glimpse of the colorful vapors, the What’s Up at Wallops? app provides updates on launch times and also includes a compass showing how to spot the dark rainbow. They are also posting launch updates to their twitter account and are streaming the launch live via Ustream."

The death is believed to be the first of an infant during the outbreak of the killer virus.

The incident was confirmed by the Illinois Department of Public Health which did not release further details of the tragedy.

“There has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant. A full investigation is underway to determine the cause of death,” said IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike.

“We must do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. If not to protect ourselves, but to protect those around us.”

We'll be bringing you the very latest updates, pictures and video on this breaking news story.

Illinois has reported a total of 3,491 cases, including 47 deaths, in 43 counties in the state.

The age of cases ranges from younger than one to 99 years.

In the United States, the number of cases stood at 119,327 on Saturday afternoon with at least 1,992 deaths.

The number of cases in the United States eclipsed those of China and Italy on Thursday.

Earlier today, Donald Trump said he was considering imposing a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

Travel would be restricted to and from those states to help stop the spread of coronavirus which has infected 100,000 people in the US so far.

“We’d like to see New York quarantined because it’s a hotspot — New York, New Jersey, maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined. I’m thinking about that right now,’ he said today.

“We might not have to do it but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine — short term two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.”

Asked whether he thought the United States would open by Easter Sunday, Trump said at the White House, “We’ll see, what happens,” he said."

The maps and charts below show the extent of the spread, and will be updated daily with data gathered from over a dozen sources by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

Where COVID-19 has spread in the U.S.

In late March, the U.S. passed China to become the country with the most confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the world, and the numbers continue to grow at a rapid rate. As of July 1, the U.S. had nearly 2.7 million total reported cases and more than 128,000 COVID-19-related deaths.

Which U.S. states are flattening the curve?

Here is the rise in the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents in each state, plotted by the day that each state reported its first case:

How does the U.S. compare to other countries?

If a community enacts the right protective measures early enough in the process, it can avoid a local outbreak that rapidly spins out of control and turns into a crisis. The goal is to avoid a sharp, concentrated uptick in cases that exceeds the capacity of the health care system, in favor of a lengthier outbreak that stays within the bounds of what the system can handle—resulting in fewer people getting sick and dying overall. This is what experts call “flattening the curve.” The following charts show how 10 nations, including the U.S., have either managed to stem the tide of the novel coronavirus, or are poised for an explosive growth in cases.

Where COVID-19 has spread around the world

Some 180 countries and territories, representing every corner of the globe, have now reported at least one case of the novel coronavirus. In total, there are nearly 10.7 million confirmed cases and more than 516,000 related deaths worldwide .

Which countries have the most COVID-19 cases?

The U.S. has by far surpassed every other country in the world in total confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, as well as in total confirmed related deaths.

The world's second richest man took part in a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session on Tuesday, during which he was asked about his thoughts on cryptocurrency.

The technology has soared in popularity over the past year as the price of Bitcoin soared to almost $20,000.

Part of the appeal of the digital cash is the anonymity it grants holders. It uses decentralised technology for secure payments and storing money that doesn't require banks or people's names.

But while that feature is lauded by some, Mr Gates said it was not ""a good thing"".

“The Governments [sic] ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing,” Mr Gates wrote."
692,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,Bill Gates is explicitly mentioned as the speaker in the article.,True,Bill Gates discusses the need for more action to combat the spread of deadly diseases and the importance of rich countries helping the developing world.,True,Bill Gates warns that outbreaks like the coronavirus crisis are a bigger threat than ever before.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections between events.,False,The article does not discuss any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"BILL Gates warns the world faces a pandemic every 20 years unless more is done to combat the spread of deadly diseases.

The billionaire said outbreaks like the coronavirus crisis are a bigger threat than ever before because of the rise in global travel.

Speaking to the Financial Times he said: ""This is the biggest event that people will have experienced in their entire lives.

""There really is a meaningful probability every 20 years or so, with lots of world travel, that one of these (viruses) will come along.""

The tech tycoon added he believes rich countries should do their bit to help the developing world fight the killer virus.

“The impact of those dollars on helping things not completely deteriorate, helping hold things together, helping accelerate that vaccine manufacturer - I think the case on that will be compelling,” he said.

Gates, however, did say he believed lessons would be learnt from the current crisis.

“There’s no doubt, having paid many trillions of dollars more than we might have had to if we’d been properly ready, people will (prepare). Because it affected the rich countries . . . we’ve been whacked on the head,” he said.

""This time we've been whacked on the head here at home people, we know the science is there... countries will step forward.""

He has already warned the US will be in ""big trouble"" until the embattled nation can come up with widespread testing for the coronavirus.

The business magnate and billionaire said the country should follow what South Korea did and create a ""unified system.""

He has already vowed his foundation will spend billions of dollars to fund the construction of factories to develop a vaccine to combat the novel coronavirus.

More than 450,000 people in the US have been infected with the virus, which is still ""completely mis-prioritized,"" according to Gates.

South Korea has seemingly weathered the storm after 10,000 people tested positive.

""The thinking is to create a website that you go in and enter your situation and it would give you a priority number, and then hopefully all the people who control the capacity limit the priority level that they accept, so they're giving these very quick results and to the right people,"" Gates told CNBC on Thursday.

He added that “until we have that, we're in big trouble because as a percentage of 330 million [Americans], we're not going to be able to test many people.

""We need to know that number because that deeply affects rebounds when opening up.

""And there is some data that suggests it's not a gigantic number but very, very important to pin that down.”

Gates cautioned that social distancing could not be relaxed until the thorough testing takes place.

He said during an interview with PBS earlier this week that the US may not be ""completely safe"" until the fall of 2021.

“The vaccine is critical, because, until you have that, things aren’t really going to be normal,” he told Judy Woodruff.

“They can open up to some degree, but the risk of a rebound will be there until we have very broad vaccination.”

The philanthropist added that the US could look to China to see where it will be down the road.

“They are sending people back to work, but they’re wearing masks,"" he told PBS.

""And so they have been able to avoid a large rebound.""

Gates also told CNBC that ""no one should think the government can wave a wand and all of a sudden the economy is anything like it was before this happened.

""That awaits either a miracle therapeutic that has an over 95 per cent cure rate, or broad usage of the vaccine.”

Experts have said that studying antibodies of those who have already been infected is also a crucial step.

“We are able to test about 1,000 patients a day … [but] what we would love to start doing and hopefully this will come online soon, is test people’s antibody levels against the virus,” Dr. Brian Garibaldi of Johns Hopkins told Yahoo.

That way “we can understand how much asymptomatic individuals are out there and be able to start making sure that we’re safe here, as the healthcare workforce, protecting ourselves … our families … our patients.""

Gates did say he believed that schools might be able to reopen in the fall.

Bush and a massive entourage came to London this week (November 18) for a rare state visit. Even before he arrived the trip provoked fury, with reports that US security officials wanted to create a three mile ‘exclusion zone’ around him, effectively shutting down central London and stopping legitimate protesters from getting anywhere near the President.

Angry at what he sees as using the “threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose”, Thom Yorke e-mailed NME last week, urging people to protest against the visit.

When asked why he’d chosen to speak out, Thom told NME: “To make Blair squirm over his decision to take us into a illegitimate war (In Iraq) and follow this religious lunatic (Bush) toward a dangerous future for the whole planet.

“Both of these men are liars. We have right to call them such, they are putting our children’s future in jeopardy. They are not controlling the terrorist threat, they are escalating it. Blair will not be allowed off the hook by his pathetic pleading for us to ‘move on’, neither shall Bush.”

Thom continued: “(The visit) will be heavily staged I think. I expect they will use the threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose, intimidate and arrest whoever they wish. The majority of British people were against this war, and Bush’s visit will just taint Blair even further.”

While in the UK Bush will be staying in Buckingham Palace. Yorke urged the Royal Family to “do something useful” and protest too. He continued: “This is a royal invitation isn’t it? How about one of the little heirs to throne doing something useful with their lives and speaking out? Refusing to shake hands for example? As we are still awaiting the results of the Hutton Inquiry I think now is a good time to remind Blair that he’s on very very very very very very very very thin ice.”

Anti-war protesters Damon Albarn and Robert ‘3-D’ Del Naja have also spoken out. 3-D told NME.COM: “The state visit of George Bush is an insult to the entire nation. The daily death and chaos in Iraq is escalating. This visit divides our people and our communities. The war on terror has only created more anger, more frustration and more militants. And the country continues to evolve into a future target for extremists.”

Albarn added: “We are still at war. We are still good at watching war. What does watching war tell us about ourselves? How does war lead to peace? How does watching war lead to peace? Two million people asked a question on February 15 – Why War? We haven’t had an answer yet.”

Travis singer Fran Healy also contacted NME.COM. He said: “Terrible timing from our government. WHY NOW? How insensitive is this? Nothing surprises me any more. The whole thing stinks. A three-mile bubble. Impressive. And the great thing is- we pay for it. We pay for all of it and we’ll keep paying in money and in lives for a long time to come. I wonder if Bush realises he’s the most unpopular man in the world. That is some feat. How does that feel? I am interested to see what happens. The police are gonna have their jobs cut out for them.”

CND are helping organise a protest march in London, which assembles tomorrow (November 20) at 2pm on Malet St. The march will go on to Trafalgar Square."

Hey, how come in the days leading up to the election, oil prices began to plunge and have continued to decline in the week since George W. Bush won re-election?

Maybe all of a sudden there's just plenty of oil sloshing around the globe. Maybe China, India, the U.S. and Japan are slowing their rates of growth and by extension reducing their demand for energy products.

But here's a piece of speculation I heard this morning, and it was, indeed, only conjecture. But what if the major oil producing countries of the world were trying to influence the outcome of the election by ""arranging"" various supply disruptions in the oil price in the hope that high oil, gas and heating oil prices would anger the American electorate so that they would throw W. from the White House.

My sophisticated investor friend, with whom I dined this morning, is no fan of conspiracy theories, but thought it an interesting concept.

Think about all the unexpected problems in the last several months... Venezuela erupts into political turmoil over Hugo Chavez's presidency. Chavez, no friend to the U.S. creates a political climate in which oil supplies become questionable from the biggest exporters around.

Russia forces its biggest oil company, Yukos, to the brink of bankruptcy in a tax dispute, threatening Russian supplies on the world market. Nigerians strike over long-simmering disputes with the government. China stockpiled oil at an aggressive pace, even beyond the levels currently demanded by their rapidly growing economy. Even Norway oil workers enter the fray. Terror acts in Iraq and Saudia Arabia would not be unexpected but would certainly be designed to hurt the U.S. as much as the places of origin.

Again, this is all conjecture, but could oil have peaked now that higher oil prices did little to unseat George W. Bush? And more important, could they be going meaningfully lower now that the world has to deal with George W. Bush for another four years?

*To be fair, a left-leaning investor that I know, months ago, made the exact opposite observation suggesting that the Bush Administration wanted oil prices high to help the states that would help him and hurt the states he was already sure to lose. But that's the whole fun of conspiracy theories, you can find one for all occasions!

**One additional note, there are many who also point out that Yasser Arafat's presumed and imminent passing from the world stage, may lead to a greater opportunity to secure a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and while not directly related to oil prices, could lead to greater stability in in the Arab world a greater standing for the U.S.

should it actively engage in that peace-making process."

We are coming to a period I call “the Great Reset.”

As it hits, we will have to deal with the largest twin bubbles in the history of the world. One of those bubbles is global debt, especially government debt. The other is the even larger bubble of government promises.

These promises add up to hundreds of trillions of dollars. That’s vastly larger than global GDP.

These are real problems we must face. It will mean forging a new social contract. It will also require changes to taxes and the economy. I believe that within the next 5–10 years, we have to end the debt and government promises.

What I mean by government promises are pensions and healthcare benefits. Governments assumed that taxes would cover their immediate costs. They thought future politicians would figure out the rest. Now the time is nearing when those “future politicians” are elected.

This Is the Worst Recovery Ever

After a big recession, debt is usually reduced. That is what many expected in 2009. Individuals in some countries did reduce their debts. That is what happened in the US. But governments and corporations did not reduce their debt.

As of 2014, total global debt rose to $199 trillion. It grew $57 trillion in just the previous seven years. That’s about $8 trillion a year.

The McKinsey Institute chart below shows how debt is split within the countries that make up the bulk of the world economy.

The debt-to-GDP ratio increased in all advanced economies from 2007 through 2014. And the trend is continuing:

And Things Are Getting Worse

After that 2014 report and through 3Q 2016, global debt rose by $17 trillion.

In fact, in just the first nine months of 2016, global debt rose $11 trillion. The average change from 2007 through 2014 was a little over $8 trillion per year. Global debt-to-GDP is now 325%, though it varies sharply by region and country.

Even worse, interest rates are slowly rising. As they do, so too does the cost of debt. In the US, according to my friend Terry Savage:

Interest on the national debt is the third largest component of our annual Federal budget—after social programs and military spending. In the most recent fiscal year, we paid $240 billion in interest on the national debt.

Now, with the Fed hiking rates, interest costs are set to soar. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that every percentage point hike in rates will cost $1.6 trillion over the next ten years!

That 1% rate hike will take roughly 3% more of our taxes every year. Governments must cover this with additional taxes, lower spending, or an increase in the deficit. If they increase deficits, there will be even more total debt and interest rate cost. And of course higher interest rates affect those of us who have mortgages and loans with floating interest rates.

And it is not just the US that faces a grave debt problem. Global GDP is roughly $80 trillion. If interest rates were to rise just 1%, $2 trillion more would go to pay that debt increase. That is about 1.5% of global GDP.

Repaying that debt requires either reduced future spending or some kind of debt liquidation. Those are the only options.

Sometime this year, world public and private debt plus unfunded pensions will surpass $300 trillion. That is not even counting the $100 trillion in US government unfunded liabilities. Oops.

A time is coming when people will realize that these cannot be met. Will voters decide to tax “the rich” more? Will they increase their VAT rates and further slow growth? Will they reduce benefits?

No matter what, hard choices will bring political and market turmoil.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ The CIA and the Justice Department are at odds over what use to make of information gained from CIA wiretaps on the telephones of drug traffickers in Mexico, three federal law enforcement officials said Thursday.

The CIA has been supplying the department with the wiretap material as part of the Reagan administration’s stepped-up war on drugs, said the officials, speaking on condition that they not be identified.

The wiretap material is relevant to a number of narcotics cases, including several in California, being assembled by U.S. law enforcement officials, and involving the importation of heroin and cocaine into this country, said the officials.

The wiretap operation was one of the subjects discussed when Peter K. Nunez, U.S. attorney in San Diego, met last week with Justice Department officials in Washington.

Transcripts of the wiretaps are understood to contain references to involvement in drug trafficking by Mexican police and officials in the Mexican government. The problem of corruption among police and government officials in Mexico is a politically sensitive issue that has caused friction between the United States and Mexico in the past.

CIA officials are reluctant to go along with suggestions by the Justice Department that attempts be made to have information from the wiretaps introduced as evidence when the cases go to court. It was not clear that CIA wiretaps conducted abroad would be admissible as evidence in U.S. courts.

The CIA’s position stems from a desire to protect the identity of its agents involved in the wiretapping operations and to have the intelligence it gathers be limited to intelligence purposes rather than being funneled into the law enforcement arena, said the officials. The CIA’s congressional mandate does not extend to law enforcement functions. The National Security Act of 1947 says the CIA ″shall have no police, subpoena, law enforcement powers or internal security functions.″

A story in Thursday editions of the Los Angeles Times quoted one unidentified source familiar with the CIA’s stand as saying, ″Suppose they (the Justice Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration) want to put the agent on the stand. He won’t be of any use in Mexico from then on.″

The discussions between the two agencies relate to one of the central points of a national security directive issued last April by President Reagan in connection with the war on drugs.

That top-secret directive enabled the government to use military surveillance and intelligence capabilities in efforts to stem the flow of narcotics into the United States.

An unclassified version of the directive disclosed June 7 by Vice President George Bush said the international drug trade is a national security concern because of its ability to destabilize democratic allies through the corruption of police and judicial institutions.

The CIA on Wednesday took the unusual step of criticizing an account of the CIA wiretapping operation published in the San Diego Union.

The newspaper quoted one unidentified source in the intelligence community as saying that the CIA operation involves wiretaps on the telephones of several high-ranking government officials.

The San Diego Union story ″is untrue and misleads the American public,″ said the three-sentence statement issued by CIA spokesman George Lauder. ″The suggestion that CIA has been targeting Mexican officials in connection with narcotics trafficking is false.″ Lauder declined to elaborate.

The CIA for the past decade has been required by presidential executive orders to gather intelligence on narcotics.

The sources for the Central Intelligence Agency were jailed and killed from 2010 to 2012 and the origin of the breach has still not been identified, according to The New York Times.

Investigators remain divided over whether there was a spy within the CIA who betrayed the sources or whether the Chinese hacked the CIA's covert communications system.

The Chinese killed at least a dozen people providing information to the CIA from 2010 through 2012, dismantling a network that was years in the making, the Times said, citing current and former US officials.

One source was shot and killed in front of a government building in China, three officials told the newspaper, saying that was designed as a message to others about working with Washington.

The breach was considered particularly damaging, with the number of assets lost rivaling those in the Soviet Union and Russia who perished after information passed to Moscow by spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen. Ames was active as a spy in the 1980s and Hanssen from 1979 to 2001.

The CIA declined to comment when asked about the Times report on Saturday.

The Chinese activities began to emerge in 2010, when the American spy agency had been getting high quality information about the Chinese government from sources deep inside the bureaucracy, including Chinese upset by the Beijing government's corruption, four former officials told the newspaper.

The information began to dry up by the end of the year and the sources began disappearing in early 2011.

As more sources were killed the FBI and the CIA began a joint investigation of the breach, examining all operations run in Beijing and every employee of the U.S. Embassy there.

The investigation ultimately centered on a former CIA operative who worked in a division overseeing China, but there was not enough evidence to arrest him.

Some investigators believed the Chinese had hacked the CIA's covert communications system.

Still others thought the breach was a result of careless spy work including traveling the same routes to the same meeting points or meeting sources at restaurants where Chinese had planted listening devices, the newspaper said.

By 2013, US intelligence concluded China's ability to identify its agents had been curtailed, the newspaper said, and the CIA has been trying to rebuild its spy network there."

ON A dusty road in northern Pakistan, a nondescript vehicle rounds a corner. Fifty metres overhead, a tiny drone buzzes unseen, spraying a fine mist across the vehicle’s roof as it passes below. The vehicle is now tagged, and can be tracked from many kilometres away by an infrared scanner on a larger drone.

This scenario may soon be played out now that Voxtel, a firm in Beaverton, Oregon, has won a US Air Force contract to develop a drone-based tagging system. Voxtel makes tagging materials – taggants – that can be used to discreetly label vehicles carrying smuggled goods, or people who are involved in civil disobedience or attempting to cross international borders illegally.

Interest in tagging technology has been driven in part by growing pressure on the White House over civilian deaths in US drone attacks. During a recent visit to Pakistan, US Secretary of State John Kerry stated that drone strikes there will end “very, very soon”. Tagging by drones would allow people to be tracked for subsequent arrest.

Voxtel’s taggants are based on quantum dots – semiconductor nanocrystals less than 50 atoms across. Because of quantum effects, they absorb and emit light at specific wavelengths. The company has demonstrated a taggant powder that, when illuminated with an invisible ultraviolet laser, can be detected by infrared cameras 2 kilometres away. The powder is delivered as an aerosol that clings to metal, glass and cloth, and batches can be engineered to have distinct spectral signatures.

The nanocrystals would be sprayed by a hand-launched drone such as the Raven (pictured). With a wingspan of less than 1.5 metres, it is quiet and has a range of several kilometres. A larger Predator drone could then illuminate the target with an ultraviolet laser and track its progress.

Nanocrystals can be sprayed by a hand-launched drone and illuminated with a laser

But spraying the taggant accurately can be tricky, as Kevin Jones and colleagues at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, discovered. They experimented with small drones that delivered a simulated taggant made from coloured sugar beads used in cake decoration. They wanted to coat a road with the stuff so that it would stick to the wheels of any vehicle that drove through.

But the wind blew the beads around as soon as they were sprayed. So Jones’s team developed software to model the effects of wind so they could allow for it when spraying. When they fed in estimates of wind speed and direction based on readings from the drone’s sensors, the drone could hit a target from an altitude of 45 metres.

A more advanced system would allow accurate tagging from greater distances, which would be more effective as small drones can be inaudible when flying further than 60 metres away.

The US Department of Homeland Security has expressed interest in giving non-lethal offensive capabilities to drones used by its Customs and Border Protection service. Any such move is bound to be contentious, and tagging might prove more acceptable to US public opinion. Drones could also use smart tagging during riots so that the people involved can be identified and later arrested.

Chris Cole of anti-drone pressure group Drone Wars UK is not reassured. He is concerned that any form of tagging could affect bystanders.

“If a drone pilot sees someone whose clothes have the tagging mark, how will they know the clothes have not been simply borrowed?” he says.

He died at 64, although he did help introduce the world to more natural foods.

Ponce de Leon also never found the Fountain of Youth, dying somewhere around the age of 61, but he did discover Florida.

And science has yet to discover the silver bullet that cures all that ails us and offers the promise of ever-longer, or never-ending, life. But that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of ideas out there to fill the void. Here are just a few, from history past and present.

The quest for immortality has probably been around since man realized he could die. Greek mythology has Sibylla, who was given everlasting life by Apollo. The only problem was that the deal didn't include eternal youth, and Sibylla ended up small, shriveled, and in a bottle begging to die.

In Gulliver's Travels, satirist Jonathan Swift created the Struldbruggs, who also were immortal. Once again though, beware of what you wish for, because they too had to live in increasing decrepitude.

Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. In a method that dates back thousands of years, some holy men in India -- and others in China, Egypt, and elsewhere -- have been tapping a fountain of youth that's no more than an arm's length away. It can be ingested over fruit, or even over Grape Nuts, for that matter. Or you can drink it fresh and warm, as some modern-day proponents of the practice preach. It's called urine therapy, and there are books and believers on the topic.

They do not say urine promises everlasting life, but instead that the ""water of Shiva"" can cure a bevy of ills, from the flu to Kaposi's sarcoma, and it can also deter aging. Some women supposedly use it for bathing to improve their skin. Of course, you must only use your own urine, not someone else's.

From the esteemed British Medical Journal comes a study of 918 Welsh men suggesting that sex may help extend life. Over 10 years of follow-up, the risk of heart attack among the group of men who had two orgasms or more per week was less than half that in the men who had less than one orgasm per month."

The US is totally justified in carrying out air strikes in Somalia, or any other country for that matter, that is harboring terrorists. These people are responsible for killing American citizens, as well as many other people from all over the world. We cannot let these people get away with these crimes. The entire world has to stand up to these animal terrorists, Europe included. If the world does not stand up now, we will have a much, much bigger problem in the years to come.

The US gets criticized for actions taken to stem terrorism. Terrorists are killing defenseless men, women, children and our freedom. How do you bring terrorists in for peace talks? Let history speak for itself. Europe has harbored and produced terrorists over the centuries because they dealt with words and promises and the terrorists replied with tanks and guns, killing civilians indiscriminately. We do not want to see history repeat itself, therefore we will stop them when and where ever we find them. In doing so, we may succeed in saving lives here and abroad. - Frank Penna

My friends in Germany, wake up and smell the jihad. Just look around you and observe your beautiful yet sad country, reeling from a century of warfare, and understandably wishing for peace in this world, being assaulted from within by an evil religious and philosophical threat. These are the very same people causing death and mayhem in the Middle East, Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, England, Spain, Thailand, and virtually in every horrific hotspot on the entire planet. Eradicating these people, especially their fanatical and absolutely evil leaders, as was done in Somalia just now, is the only way to achieve a true and lasting peace. Somalia will only have this chance by eliminating the radical Islamic threat. Only a fool loves war, but only an extinct fool ignores those intent on killing and dominating him. Godspeed to the Ethiopian army. More civilized nations, especially the ""blind mice"" of Europe, had better come on board before it's too late. Germany: you have fought for all the wrong reasons in the 20th century; now is the time to redeem yourself and fight for the right reason. - Ron Jendry

I believe it was the Islamist and warlords that destabilized Somalia, not the USA, which killed a known terrorist, one that could have easily struck any of the EU embassies or nations.

The South Asian nation of 220 million people recorded the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases Wednesday since the outbreak hit Pakistan in late February.

Several members of national and provincial legislatures are among nearly 2,300 Pakistanis who died after contracting the virus. The speaker of the National Assembly barred members from attending house sessions unless they are tested for the virus.

COVID-19 infections have particularly soared since late last month when the government relaxed nationwide restrictions on commercial and public activities. Hospitals, particularly in major Pakistani cities, have warned over the past several days they are running out of space, and some even turned away new patients.

The escalation in the COVID-19 outbreak prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) this week to urge Pakistan to impose a new round of public lockdown restrictions to curb the spread of the disease.

Palitha Mahipala, the WHO’s country chief, wrote a letter to health authorities in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, suggesting intermittent lockdowns of “two weeks on, two weeks off” to combat the virus.

The strategy, Mahipala said, would keep economic activity going in the country. He also recommended Pakistani officials double their testing capacity to 50,000. ""As of today, Pakistan does not meet any of the prerequisite conditions for opening the lockdown,” said Mahipala.

Pakistani Health Minister Zafar Mirza, while responding to the WHO assertions Wednesday, defended the government policy, reiterating that lockdowns would badly impact the poorest in a country where two-thirds of the population depend on day-to-day earnings.

“The government's choice of policies has been guided by the best evidence available about the disease spread and our best assessment of the fast deteriorating socioeconomic conditions in the country,"" Mirza said in a statement.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has been under fire for opposing a complete coronavirus lockdown despite accelerating COVID-19 infections. Khan has said that about 150 million people in Pakistan would suffer from starvation because his cash-starved government cannot feed them beyond a few months.

Meanwhile, the Paris Club of creditor nations has agreed to suspend debt service payments from several more countries, including Pakistan, as part of a G-20 (the grouping of 20 leading economies) debt relief deal in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The overall debt relief means the suspension of $1.8 billion payable by Pakistan over the next year.

The Paris Club said in a statement it had agreed to suspend interest and principal repayments from Chad, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Republic of Congo in the latest wave of countries given some financial leeway to help them focus on fighting the coronavirus pandemic."

Before, and during, the coronavirus pandemic, 5G was the root of much misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation is incorrect information accidentally shared, while disinformation is false data shared with malicious intent to deceive the audience.

In the UK, this has been most prominent as more than 30 acts of arson and vandalism has taken place against wireless towers by people under the false impression that the signal is related to the spread of the coronavirus.

Now, when people on the social media site search for 5G-related information, they will receive a pop-up stating that “The UK government has said there is no evidence of a link between 5G and coronavirus (COVID-19)” with a link to further information below.

This is not the first time the company has had to step in to direct people from coronavirus misinformation. The company said it has “broadened our guidance on unverified claims that incite people to engage in harmful activity” and will now actively remove misleading and potentially harmful content. However, Twitter has said it will not remove all content falsely-linking 5G to the coronavirus

In statements, Katy Minshall, Head of Government, Public Policy and Philanthropy, at Twitter UK said: ''We continue our focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. Today, through a partnership with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), we launched a new on-service prompt in the UK that will direct people to a Government webpage with credible, factual and verified information relating to 5G.

“Our partnerships throughout this pandemic, have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant, and useful for them and we're happy to add this update today, in collaboration with DCMS in the UK.''

Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden also said: “We have set up a new counter disinformation unit and are working with the social media platforms to make sure the public has access to reliable information during the coronavirus crisis and to give us a much better picture of where disinformation is spreading. This move by Twitter directing users to official Government advice is a step in the right direction as part of this work.“

Twitter is not the only social media platform to be taking action against coronavirus and 5G misinformation. Facebook, and its image-sharing company Instagram, has said it is taking “aggressive steps” to remove stories linking coronavirus and 5G – but only if they will cause physical harm.

However, questions remain over whether these actions are beneficial. Many of those who share, or seek, conspiracy theories linking 5G and the coronavirus are unlikely to trust the government, and as such as fact-checking provided the government may not convince them.

5G is in no way related to the coronavirus. The coronavirus has spread in countries that do not yet have 5G connectivity such as Iran and Malaysia. Moreover, 5G signals in the UK are built over the existing 4G signals that have existed in the country for nearly a decade, which did not cause a major pandemic.

Wired reports that the conspiracy theory originated from a “scientifically-baseless claim” that spread through Facebook groups and via YouTube videos. It has since been spread by numerous celebrities to audiences of millions."

For some people, this so-called immune amnesia may linger for months to years after an infection.

These studies add even more weight to the importance of getting vaccinated, Colin Russell of the University of Amsterdam and senior author of the study in Science Immunology, says in a press release. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, it was nearly guaranteed that every child would catch measles, and an estimated 2.6 million died from the disease each year. The measles vaccine, which is often combined with mumps and rubella, is incredibly effective, with two doses imparting nearly 97-percent protection, resulting in dramatic declines in measles deaths around the world.

In recent years, though, measles has been once more on the rise. In 2018, 98 countries reported more cases than in the prior year, according to a UNICEF report released in March. While infrastructure issues and civil strife have been interfering with vaccination campaigns in some parts of the world, experts say there’s another issue behind the recent slew of cases: complacency about vaccination.

However, the data show that’s not true: Not only did measles cases plummet once vaccine use became widespread, but cases of other diseases dropped as well—pneumococcus, diarrhea, and more. In resource-poor regions, the decline was as dramatic as 50 percent; in impoverished regions, it dropped by as much as 90 percent.



“We actually saw the whole overall baseline for childhood mortality drop precipitously,” says Harvard's Michael Mina, an author on a 2015 study analyzing this decline and lead author of the new study in Science. In essence, the measles vaccine seems to not only protect populations against measles, it may be keeping a slew of other infections at bay, and one way it could be doing this is through prevention of immune amnesia.

The team, led in part by Rik de Swart, an Erasmus University Medical Center virologist who coauthored both of the latest studies, exploited one viral necessity: To multiply and spread, a virus has to invade a cell, hijacking the machinery to copy itself. So they inserted a gene in the measles virus that encodes for a fluorescent protein and introduced the modified virus into macaques. As the modified virus invades the cells to make copies, its host will light up, letting the scientists track its movement at various stages of the disease.

Everywhere the monkey has lymphoid tissues—which house immune cells—glowing green speckles appeared, twinkling like stars in the night sky. These winks of light revealed that the virus favors what's known as immune memory cells. These cells record and catalog your lifetime of infections, helping you efficiently battle future invaders on repeat encounters. Later in the infection, the virus also settles into the surface lining of the lungs and nose, which help it launch into the air with each cough.

The team later confirmed that a similar mechanism is likely at play in humans. But it's unclear exactly how much immune memory vanished; that probably varies from person to person, de Swart notes. Still, the process emphasizes why secondary disease is so common with measles: Not only does the virus assault the immune system's first line of defense and damage your skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tract, it also erases your other hard-won resistances.

In a 2015 Science study, Mina and his colleagues tried to tackle this question by turning to massive data sets from the United States, Denmark, England, and Wales from before and after widespread vaccination began in the 1960s. The analysis revealed that declines in childhood disease were stark. In general, when measles was flourishing in unvaccinated populations, up to half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease could be explained by non-measles infection that occur following illness with measles.

What's more, the effects lingered. At any given time, the best predictor of non-measles deaths was the total number of measles cases during the prior three years, Mina explains. This suggests that kids with measles still had a higher risk of death from infections three years later. But these temporal relationships can only tell the scientists so much.

That’s where the latest pair of studies comes in, helping to reveal some of the many intricacies behind the viral attack. For this new work, the researchers studied unvaccinated children between four and 17 years old who attend Orthodox Protestant schools in the Netherlands. They sampled the students’ blood before catching measles and then again after a measles outbreak in 2013.

That isn't the case in many developing regions, where something as seemingly mild as diarrhea can kill. And because the virus attacks the immune system, the severity of infections depends on the general health of the population. In essence, measles acts like an infection amplifier, turning up the volume of background disease. This means that in resource-limited areas, the virus will cause higher overall death rates.

“In lots of developing countries still today, we see one in 50 or one in a hundred kids still dying from measles, primarily due to these sort of immune effects,” Mina says. To make matters worse, measles is contagious long before those infected even know it, making it easy for the virus to tag along if its unwitting hosts take to traveling."

HANOVER, N.H. (AP) — Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that the struggles between President Donald Trump’s administration and the U.S. House will show “whether it’s the rule of law or the rule of Trump” that the courts and Republicans obey.

Speaking at a wide-ranging event held at Dartmouth College, the former U.S. secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said the Trump administration’s recent defiance of subpoenas and claim of executive authority in its power struggle with Congress will lead to “big court fights.”

Those fights, Clinton said, will most likely find their way to the Supreme Court.

“We’ll see whether it’s the rule of law or the rule of Trump that the Republicans in the Congress and in the courts are going to abide by,” Clinton said.

Time and again in her remarks Wednesday to foreign policy students, Clinton returned to the 2016 election that she ultimately lost to Trump, criticizing the media and the effect that conspiracy theories had on her candidacy.

“Just think about the impact that that one lie, the Pizzagate lie, had,” Clinton said, referring to a fake news story suggesting a Washington, D.C., pizza shop played a key role in a child sex trafficking ring that she was said to have run.

“It was a stolen email about a little fundraiser at a little pizza place that the Russians and their allies, including, I would argue, people online who were promoting Trump, took and made into a weaponized attack.”

The conspiracy theory influenced a North Carolina man to fire a rifle in the restaurant in December 2016. Fortunately, no one was injured.

“This kind of agitation, this kind of conspiracy, fetishizing, the lies, it has real world consequences. So we’ve got to figure out how we’re going to handle this and stand up against it,” she said.

“But, you know, I sleep well at night because, look, I testified for 11 hours,” she said, referring to a Republican-led House committee that questioned her about Benghazi in 2015. “What do I care?”

During the roughly hourlong event, Clinton took questions from a pair of former Democratic administration officials she worked with during her time as secretary of state.

On Iran, Clinton said she worries greatly that “there is some desire” on the part of the current administration to provoke something. Clinton said she also took it as a badge of honor that she “really annoyed” Russian Vladimir Putin, who U.S. intelligence agencies have said interfered in the 2016 election in an effort to help Trump beat Clinton.

Clinton praised House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for “forging ahead” on Democratic issues like protecting former President Barack Obama’s health care law, which the Trump administration has tried to dismantle.

“You’ve got to keep putting points on the board that the American people can see while we’re fighting out this constitutional crisis,” Clinton said."

(CNN) The world is desperate for a vaccine against coronavirus. If and when it is discovered, will the voices of the anti-vaccine movement tell their adherents to turn it down?

If you asked this question of parents in the US in the 1950s, the response would likely be unequivocal.

This is because of the fear that gripped a nation, fear caused by the lethal poliovirus. When the US polio epidemic was at its highest, the country reported more than 21,000 cases of paralysis, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than 3,000 lives were lost.

Whereas today children — though in rare cases vulnerable to a little-known and frightening inflammatory disease -- seem to be mainly transmitters of coronavirus, in 1952 they were the primary victims of polio.

Our history books paint a bleak picture of life during the polio epidemic: Deserted playgrounds, empty swimming pools, restricted travel and imposed quarantines.

Movie theaters were closed to avoid spreading the disease. Children were kept alive in hospitals by an earlier version of respirators called ""iron lungs,"" which allowed them to breathe when the virus had paralyzed their chest muscles.

The parallels with the coronavirus are obvious, and not only in the societal impact of an infectious disease before a vaccine was discovered. Polio was and still is another silent killer, primarily spread from person to person. Like Covid-19, it could display no visible symptoms in many infected people, flu-like symptoms in others and more serious, disabling or sometimes fatal effects in others. In the late 1980s, polio was endemic in 125 countries, according to the World Health Organization, and was infecting about 350,000 children a year — nearly 1,000 children every day.

How have we reached this point, where even during an extraordinary international public health crisis, there are still those who oppose vaccination, despite its track record in saving millions of lives?

In the US, before those vaccines are licensed, a rigorous vaccine safety system ensures that they are safe and effective, involving multiple rounds of testing and clinical trials. Backed by the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC, this system upholds, in the words of Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the safety and ""scientific integrity"" of any new vaccine. Even with the accelerated timelines attempted in the development of a coronavirus vaccine, safety is still prioritized by what doctors describe as many steps being executed in parallel compared to the traditional linear, years-long model of vaccine development.

The phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy — the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines — is of global concern.

For others, the act of refusing vaccines and placing others at risk is no less than an expression of their identity, a twisted manifestation of ""rugged individualism,"" the term widely used by Herbert Hoover.

Perhaps vaccine debates continue, in part, due to the fact that many young parents simply don't know anyone who has suffered the ravaging effects of a vaccine-preventable disease such as polio.

In a way, vaccines have become victims of their own success.

But the costs are too great to allow for irrational fear of vaccines to outweigh the real consequences of catching a disease such as Covid-19, which is claiming lives, and causing unprecedented changes in society. Tragically, the anti-vaccine movement has expanded from one making phony claims linking vaccines to autism, to one tied to extremist groups who see social distancing as a form of conspiracy or government plots.

When the bias against science spreads to the sphere of public health, it has a dangerous effect, particularly in times of crisis.

This is compounded by another devastating consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic: the very real possibility of further increased rates of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is a real threat in cities facing the largest Covid-19 outbreaks, which are seeing a decrease in vaccination rates given parents' fear of taking their children to hospitals and clinics. On a global level, WHO recently announced that 80 million babies, many in vulnerable countries, are not getting lifesaving routine vaccinations in light of the pandemic.

With staggering statistics like this, it is more important now than ever before that we rely on science, facts and research. The lives and livelihood of millions of children, not just vulnerable adults, are at stake.

We hope that when we have a safe and proven vaccine against coronavirus, this pernicious thinking will be resisted as vaccination protects us all against disease. For the good of every generation, and every nation, the choice to embrace a future coronavirus vaccine -- and vaccines in general -- is a simple one."

“We’ve achieved a number of milestones to get here,” says Eric Lerner, president of Lawrenceville Plasma Physics, which is at work on “dense plasma fusion.”

For decades, fusion has been considered a safer way to generate power from nuclear reactions because it doesn’t produce radioactive waste or create dangerous contamination situations, as in the Chernobyl and Fukushima meltdowns.

Lerner's team has accomplished two of the three steps needed for energy-generating nuclear fusion — achieving the ultra-high temperatures necessary to burn the hydrogen-boron fuel his process uses, and successfully transferring that energy to plasma form.

“It’s 150 times hotter than the center of the sun,” he says of the temperature required, about 1.5 billion degrees Kelvin.

This step in his firm’s “hot” fusion technique requires enormous amounts of energy as well, if only for a few nanoseconds.

But that third step to creating net energy out of the process — to have an environment where energy isn’t transferred, or “wasted” when the superheated particles hit cooler surrounding particles — is a tough one.

“It’s certainly doable but it’ll take some engineering,” admits Lerner, who estimates the cost to get there at “around $30-50 million, a drop in the bucket for a government.”

“There are large efforts going on in fusion,” adds Albert Machiels, senior technical executive with the Electric Power Research Institute, an energy research organization. “But I don’t think in the next 10 years you’ll see fusion projects leave the lab. There’s a lot that must happen.”

Instead, he says, the next generation of nuclear power plants that could be built will likely be updated versions of today’s uranium-powered nuclear fission systems."

As it is, they are not true – but their importance could nonetheless be hugely significant.

It might have been destined to stay as an underground conspiracy theory. But it has quickly taken root both online and off – becoming a feature of Trump rallies and being shared by some of the most important people in the media.

It is undeniably dark: it accuses some of the most powerful people in the world of some of the most heinous crimes. And it remains mostly mysterious.

Q is, well, anon. Nobody knows who they are, or why they are posting what they do.

They are, among other things, a user on 4chan. They use that forum to post a whole load of cryptic messages, which make reference to the vast conspiracy theory that has become known as QAnon.

Sometimes, the posts are like puzzles, offerings hints and encouraging the people reading them to get involved. Others are more explicit, making allegations about specific people and in detail.

And they do appear to be a “they”. Q refers to themselves as “we”, apparently at least trying to suggest that it is a group rather than just one person.

The name appears to be a reference to the fact that the person claims to have “Q” clearance, a designation in the US Department of Energy that would allow the holder access to classified material.

For now, the identity or identities behind the conspiracy theory remains secret, and it’s possible it will always remain that way. While there is sometimes a specific focus on certain issues – such as the bureaucracy of the US government, and how it is trying to foil Donald Trump – it’s impossible to know whether the real people behind Q actually have any experience of it.

What do they claim?

The posts tend to focus on the president and the things going on around him. Q appears to be a Trump supporter, and many of the posts complain about the fact the “deep state” is blighting his work.

But they spread out in to a vast conspiracy theory, which links up to people including Hillary Clinton and Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation into Russian interference in the election. It borrows from other conspiracy theories – such as Pizzagate, which accused a variety of well-known people of running a paedophile ring, and the long-running false claims about the death of Seth Rich – and adds yet more on top.

Q has posted that Special Counsel Robert Mueller isn’t investigating Trump at all — he’s really investigating Hillary Clinton, John Podesta and Barack Obama. Other theories involve familiar players in conspiracy theories such as the Freemasons and the Illuminati, while others mention The Titanic, paedophile rings in Hollywood, and the possibility that former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin wears an ankle monitor. Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, the Rothschild family and Satan also make appearances in discussions.

Sometimes the posts are cryptic, throwing the bakers into a frenzy of riddle solving, such as:

Where did all of this come from?

The theory began in October 2017, with an ominous post on 4chan titled “Calm Before the Storm” and written by someone using the name “Q Clearance Patriot”.

And where is it now?

The theory has grown and flourished, breaking out into the mainstream. It has been supported by celebrities and its followers have made appearances in real life at Trump rallies.

It also seems to be taking hold on more traditional platforms. This week, for instance, it emerged that for a brief time searching on YouTube for Tom Hanks would bring up false claims that he is a paedophile, which was linked to the QAnon theory.

Tens of thousands of people actively follow along on devoted subreddits and Twitter accounts. Many more have no doubt come into contact with the theory.

Do people believe this?

In short, yes. Probably not very many of them – but those people who do believe it seem to believe in it very fiercely.

And some of its followers are very famous indeed. The actress Roseanne Barr might even have been fired because of ideas that began with QAnon.

She has tweeted about Q and retweeted posts from the “QAnon” account. In Nov. 2017, she tweeted “Who is Q?” and reportedly asked Q to direct message her. In May, Barr posted a racist tweet about former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, who figures in some QAnon conspiracy theories. In response, ABC cancelled her hit TV show.

Why does it matter?

The allegations are damaging and dangerous, there’s no doubt. But there are plenty of damaging and dangerous accusations floating around the internet, many of which go unremarked upon.

QAnon is more dangerous for a couple of important reasons: the very damaging allegations that it makes are being broadcast to many people, many of whom might not realise they are fake; and because it bears many similarities to Pizzagate, which ended in real violence when a person entered a pizza restaurant carrying a gun."

“Angels & Demons”, again starring Tom Hanks as Langdon and directed by Ron Howard, premieres in Rome on Monday at a theatre a mile away from Vatican City.

In the film, Langdon is recruited by the Vatican after the pope dies and four cardinals who are favourites to succeed him are kidnapped.

Langdon races through the “Eternal City” deciphering clues linked to a centuries-old secret society, the Illuminati.

“He is not the man the Vatican trusts — he is the man the Vatican needs,” Howard said in production notes for the movie.

Ewan McGregor plays the central role of the “Camerlengo”, or chamberlain, who runs the Vatican between the time of the pope’s death and the election of his successor.

“He sees himself as a man who will do whatever it takes to save the Church from the Illuminati and everything they represent,” McGregor said.

The film hits theatres in the United States on May 15.

Angels & Demons has so far avoided the kind of broadside the Vatican aimed at The Da Vinci Code film in 2005 and 2006 and the following year at “The Golden Compass” starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.

“Dramatizing the issue involuntarily gives publicity to Angels & Demons,” said Archbishop Velasio De Paolis, in an interview with Italy’s La Stampa newspaper.

“Be careful not to play their game.”

The Da Vinci Code upset the Vatican and some Catholics because of its storyline, in which Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had children, creating a royal bloodline that Church officials kept secret for centuries.

Christians are taught that Jesus never married, was crucified and rose from the dead.

Despite the controversy, and a critical mauling at the Cannes film festival where it was launched, The Da Vinci Code went on to gross more than $750 million worldwide, supporting the theory that no publicity is bad publicity.

However, the Rome archdiocese did refuse Angels & Demons the right to shoot in historic churches, forcing the crew to recreate them in Los Angeles.

And in the United States, Bill Donahue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, accused Brown and Howard of “smearing the Catholic Church with fabulously bogus tales”.

Howard responded by saying that neither he nor his new movie were anti-Catholic.

“And let me be a little controversial: I believe Catholics, including most in the hierarchy of the Church, will enjoy the movie for what it is: an exciting mystery, set in the awe-inspiring beauty of Rome,” Howard wrote in a post on the The Huffington Post website."

What was Roseanne Barr's racist Twitter rant about Valerie Jarrett?

Roseanne Barr joked that former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett is a product of the Muslim Brotherhood and the ""Planet of the Apes.""

Barr then apologised to Jarrett on Twitter ""for making a bad joke"" about her politics and her looks.

Meanwhile, comic Wanda Sykes, who is a consulting producer on ""Roseanne"", tweeted that she would not be returning to the show.

Barr's now-deleted tweet read: ""Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = VJ.""

It was a busy day on Twitter for Barr, who also tweeted or re-tweeted attacks on Michael Moore, Chelsea Clinton and George Soros.

In her apology, Barr said the Jarrett comment was ""in bad taste"".

The Roseanne TV show revival this spring was an unexpected major hit for ABC.

Barr apologised again on July 26 for her controversial Twitter comment but insisted she had been misunderstood and said the mistake ""cost me everything"".

ABC cancelled its hit reboot of Roseanne following her racist tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett.

President Channing Dungey said the comment ""is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel the show"".

The show was particularly popular among many conservative viewers because Barr's character expressed support for President Donald Trump."

The latest research from the Royal Free Hospital comes as Prime Minister Tony Blair gave another hint that his son Leo has had the jab.

It has been suggested the MMR had caused a particular form of autism - known as new variant autism - in which children deteriorate over time and suffer bowel disorders.

However, the Royal Free scientists found no evidence of such a link.

The research, published on the British Medical Journal's website, looked at case records for almost 500 children with autism born between 1979 and 1998.

It found the proportion of children with developmental problems or bowel disorders did not change significantly over that time.

The measles, mumps and rubella triple jab was introduced 1988.

The researchers say if there was an association between MMR and new variant autism, there would have been an increase in cases after that date.

Autism was just as likely among children who did not receive MMR, or to have surfaced in children before they were vaccinated.

This is the third time the researchers have conducted a study of this type - on each occasion for a longer period. Each time, the results have been the same.

Professor Brent Taylor of the Royal Free who led the research told BBC News Online: ""There is no evidence of a new variant form, no evidence.""

He added that there was ""no relation whatsoever"" between MMR and autism, and a ""huge amount of good evidence that there's no relation"".

Professor Taylor added children were being put at risk of measles, mumps and rubella by not having the MMR jab.

He added: ""I hope that this is the end of the argument.""

The past week has seen a new wave of controversy over the safety of the MMR jab, with many parents and campaign groups are calling for the measles vaccine to be available separately.

Government experts have said this would inevitably put more children at risk.

In statement posted on the 10 Downing Street website, Tony Blair said: """"It is the responsibility of all of us, as parents, to ensure our children's health.

""Against measles, mumps and rubella, the combined MMR vaccine is the best way of doing that.""

Dr Peter Dukes of the Medical Research Council, which carried out a review of autism research including looking at whether there was a link with MMR, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The evidence shows there's no link between MMR and autism.

""What people feel about it is probably another matter.""

Jackie Fletcher from Jabs, the support group for parents who believe their children have been damaged by the vaccine told : ""What concerns us is that we have a huge body of children 1,600, believed to have been affected by the MMR and they have not been investigated.

But Judith Barnard, director of policy and public affairs for the National Autistic Society said: ""The experts themselves came to the conclusion that there couldn't exclude the possibility of a susceptible sub-group that could be affected by the MMR.

""The real question is how to identify that.""

Ms Barnard said some children developed serious bowel conditions and severe regressive autism, when they had previously been healthy.

""I think its high time we stopped playing this ping-pong game and actually committed to doing this research around this group to find out what they have in common, what has caused this condition in these children.""

The latest figures show UK-wide take-up of the MMR jab fell to a record low between July and September last year with a coverage rate of just 84.2%. The recommended rate is 95%."

The article also mentions the Bush administration and the CIA.",True,"The article describes the torture techniques used on Abu Zubaydah, including waterboarding, walling, stress positions, and confinement in cramped boxes.",True,"The article describes the torture techniques used on Abu Zubaydah, which caused him distress, pain, and mental anguish.",False,The article does not discuss any patterns or connections between events.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead the public or cover up information.,"Washington (CNN) Newly released illustrations drawn this year by Guantanamo Bay detainee Abu Zubaydah depict in graphic detail how he was tortured in 2002 at a Central Intelligence Agency detention ""black site,"" according to his civilian lawyer.

The illustrations were released in a report written by Zubaydah's lawyer, Seton Hall University School of Law Professor Mark Denbeaux and some of his students. The New York Times first published the pictures.

The report , titled ""How America Tortures,"" describes the treatment Zubaydah and others endured. The Bush administration maintained the treatment was not torture, calling it instead ""enhanced interrogation techniques.""

The program was approved by the Bush Administration in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, as counterterrorism officials tried to obtain information about possible future attacks.

According to a Senate Intelligence report , Zubaydah was waterboarded at least 83 times. The 2014 report on the CIA's detention and interrogation program said that he at one point became ""completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth.""

The images included in the newly released report depict Zubaydah, an alleged al Qaeda operative who was captured in 2002 in Pakistan and put into CIA custody, in distress, either naked or lightly clothed, often forced into contorted positions, confined to tight spaces, or with his arms shackled above his head.

In a statement, Denbeaux said, ""with this report, he is silent no more.""

One drawing depicts a technique described in the report as ""walling."" In it, Zubaydah appears to be standing naked and shackled, while another man, whose face is hidden, appears to be holding something around Zubaydah's neck and slamming Zubaydah's head into a wall.

The CIA declined to comment on the newly released material.

That technique is consistent with what ex-CIA psychologist John ""Bruce"" Jessen admitted to doing to Zubaydah in his 2016 legal response to a criminal complaint by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Jessen said he ""placed a rolled up towel behind Zubaydah's neck and 'walled' him three or four times."" The ACLU alleged Jessen and another ex-CIA psychologist, James Elmer Mitchell, were behind ""an experimental torture program for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency."" Both men denied they had committed torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, but admitted they used techniques many consider to be torture. President Obama banned some so-called ""extraordinary interrogation techniques"" in 2009, such as waterboarding.

The report quotes Zubaydah describing one of his walling sessions: ""I fell down on the floor with each banging. I felt for few instants that I was unable to see anything, let alone the short chains that prevented me from standing tall. And every time I fell he would drag me with the towel which caused bleeding on my neck.""

There has been a lot of debate about how important a figure Zubaydah was in al Qaeda. Zubaydah, according to government prosecutors. ""played a key role in al Qaeda's communications with supporters and operatives abroad and closely interacted with al Qaeda's second in command at the time."" The US government has also alleged after the September 11 attacks he played a more active role in attack planning. At a 2016 hearing his military attorney said Zubaydah had no interest in harming the US or any other country.

Other illustrations depict Zubaydah in what the report calls ""stress positions,"" both standing and sitting, allegedly to create ""physical pressure.""

Another drawing depicts what the report refers to as ""wall standing,"" showing Zubaydah with his arms shackled above his head as he stands on his toes, ""to induce extreme pain, sleep deprivation, and mental anguish when used to extremes."" The report quotes Zubaydah saying he ""passed out"" in that position, and felt his hands became ""paralyzed or severed.""

Several drawings depict Zubaydah confined to cramped boxes of various sizes, which the report quotes him as saying made him ""scream unconsciously"" from the pain from trying to keep his body contorted to fit in the box.

One illustration depicts Zubaydah undergoing the infamous water boarding technique, strapped to a table with water pouring on a cloth over his face, in order to simulate drowning, according to the report, which quotes Zubaydah as saying, ""I felt I was going to die from drowning."""

For example, the article mentions the super-secret unit within South Africa's military intelligence apparatus and the CIA's involvement in drug trafficking.","The dirtiest secrets of South Africa’s apartheid regime are now spilling out in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in Cape Town. It’s a pity that the chilling stories haven’t made much of a commotion in the United States, whose own intelligence agencies have traveled along the same path.

In 1997, press reports detailed a South African agent’s description of drug smuggling to raise money for terrorist schemes, including chemical experimentation on blacks. He said he had done this on behalf of the Directorate of Covert Collections, a super-secret unit within South Africa’s military intelligence apparatus. The drugs--ecstasy and mandrax--were manufactured in labs run by Wouter Basson, one of the chieftains of South Africa’s chemical and biological weapons program. Basson was arrested in 1997.

Hearings this month at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered vivid insights of what went on at Roodeplaat Research Laboratories, a military installation where Basson oversaw production of infamous materials. Dr. Schalk van Rensburg testified that “the most frequent instruction” from Basson was for development of a compound that would kill but make the cause of death seemingly natural. “That was the chief aim of the Roodeplaat Research Laboratory.”

The laboratory manufactured cholera organisms, anthrax to be deposited on the gummed flaps of envelopes and in cigarettes and chocolate, walking sticks firing fatal darts that would feel like bee stings. Van Rensburg took his riveted audience painstakingly through what he called “the murder lists” of toxins and delivery systems. These included 32 bottles of cholera that, one of the lab’s technicians testified, would be most effectively used in the water supply.

There were plans to slip the still imprisoned Nelson Mandela covert doses of the heavy metal poison, thallium, designed to make his brain function become “impaired, progressively,” as Van Rensburg put it. In one case, lethal toxins went from Roodeplaat to a death squad detailed by the apartheid regime to kill one of its opponents, the Rev. Frank Chikane. The killers planted lethal chemicals in his clothing, expecting him to travel to Namibia, where they reckoned there would be “very little forensic capability.” Instead, Chikane went to the U.S., where doctors identified the toxins and saved his life.

The big dream at Roodeplaat was to develop race-specific biochemical weapons, targeting blacks. Van Rensburg was ordered by Basson to develop a vaccine to make blacks infertile. Van Rensburg told the truth commission that was his major project. There also were plans to distribute infected T-shirts in the black townships to spread disease and infertility.

Americans need not entertain feelings of moral superiority. In 1960, in one of the CIA’s frequent attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro, the agency planned to put thallium salts in Castro’s shoes before he addressed the United Nations. Years later, the Nicaraguan government reported that a CIA-supplied team tried to assassinate its foreign minister by giving him a bottle of Benedictine laced with thallium.

U.S. military researchers of biochemical warfare in the 1950s conducted race-specific experimentation. In 1980, the U.S. Army admitted that Norfolk Naval Supply Center was contaminated with infectious bacteria in 1951 to test the Navy’s vulnerability to biological warfare attack. The Army disclosed that one of the bacteria types was chosen because blacks were known to be more susceptible to it than whites.

One of the investigators for the truth commission, Zhensile Kholsan, has been reported as saying that there is a strong suggestion that “drugs were fed into communities that were political centers, to cause socioeconomic chaos.” Black communities in the U.S. have expressed similar suspicions, particularly about the arrival of crack cocaine in South-Central Los Angeles in the early 1980s, allegedly imported by CIA-sponsored Nicaraguans raising money for arms.

In March, CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz finally conceded to a U.S. congressional committee that the agency had worked with drug traffickers and had obtained a waiver from the Justice Department in 1982 (the beginning of the Contra funding crisis) allowing it not to report drug trafficking by agency contractors.

Was the lethal arsenal deployed at Roodeplaat assembled with advice from the CIA and other U.S. agencies? There were certainly close contacts over the years. It was a CIA tip that led the South African secret police to arrest Nelson Mandela.

A truth commission here wouldn’t do any harm."

The fake war in Albania was meant to not only distract the public but to not let a sex scandal influence the presidential election that was quickly approaching. Creating a war united the American public and boosted patriotism among Americans. Although it was ethically wrong to fabricate a war as a distraction, the reason was that it would be better for the American public.

Having the ability to create a fake war opens up many dangerous doors. Ethically, it is wrong to lie to millions of people about what is going on in the world. The media is what influences and shapes public opinion. Therefore, by feeding fake stories to the public, you are altering their opinions. The public deserves to know the truth about what is going on the world so their opinions can influence a decision that is best for them. The possibility of fabricating news will change history and soon it will be unclear what is true and what is not.

Members have the media have historically attempted to deceive the public for a number of different reasons. Janet Cooke fabricated a story called “Jimmy’s World” where she made up an 8-year-old heroin addict. This and many cases in which reporters lied about their sources and stories have made the media increasingly unreliable to the public. If reporters continue to fabricate stories, lie about sources, and alter public opinion then the media will become completely unreliable.

I think the situation should have been handled very differently. A scandal as minor as the sex scandal the president was involved with should have been transparent. If the public saw that the president was attempting to be honest and publicly apologized, the scandal would have soon blown over. If it ever got out that the White House fabricated an entire story just as a distraction, the repercussions would have been much worse than if the president would have just apologized.

This issue impacts the very existence of journalism. If the media is not being truthful to the best of their ability, then there is no use for it. But if the media is fabricating stories in order to distract the public, then that is not only altering public opinion but altering history."

Fresh from dumping two dead bodies in a river, Pat sets his eyes on another enemy in tonight's double-bill.

The scheming builder tried to make Seb think that Anna Windass had deliberately tried to kill him by causing his ladder to collapse.

With Seb unconscious in the hospital, Phelan dripped poison in his ear and whispered his shocking lies to try and get Anna done for murder.

The soap villain, who forced Andy Carver to kill Vinny Ashford before turning the gun on his prisoner, came to Seb's bedside to carry out his next twisted move.

Leaning in towards Seb, he muttered: ""Anna Windass hates you, she wants you dead. You hear me. Anna Windass wants you dead. She pushed you off that ladder.""

Pheland proved to have amazing powers of persuasion, as his Jedi mind trick really did convince Seb that it was Anna that pushed him off the ladder.

Once Seb woke up, he revealed to Faye that Anna was the one that caused him to fall.

Seb said: ""Anna wants me dead. She pushed me off that a ladder.""

Viewers know that this is not the case as Anna was walking out of the cafe at the time.

However, Faye phoned the police and grassed her own mum up.

Corrie viewers took to Twitter after seeing Pat's amazing powers of persuasion.

One viewer said: ""Was enjoying the Phelan storyline but getting into Seb’s mind is utter bollox #Corrie""

Another added: ""Phelan can do cunjouring mind manipulation?! Diabolical storyline. #corrie""

A third said: ""God Phelans mind games are good!! #corrie""

A roundup of some of the most popular, but completely untrue, headlines of the week. None of these stories are legit, even though they were shared widely on social media. AP checked these out; here are the real facts:

NOT REAL: Donald Trump Signs Executive Order Allowing The Hunting Of Bald Eagles

THE FACTS: The story was shared by the St. George Gazette and attributed to The Associated Press. But the AP never ran such a story because the president gave no such order. A list of executive orders issued by Trump mentions nothing about bald eagles. Congress first outlawed the killing of the national bird in 1918. The St. George Gazette is an outlet of admitted hoax artist Paul Horner.

NOT REAL: George Soros Indicted For Voter Machine Fraud And More

THE FACTS: A search of the federal court system shows no criminal cases pending against the Hungarian-American billionaire known to back liberal causes, despite a story posted by The People’s Resistance that claimed Soros was federally indicted. The post included a photo that appeared to show Soros in a courtroom. The picture is actually a doctored image of a hacker being sentenced in June for stealing from a Soros foundation.

NOT REAL: NASA Will Pay You $18,000 To Stay In Bed And Smoke Weed For 70 Straight Days

THE FACTS: NASA has been willing to pay people willing to stay in bed, but there was no marijuana involved in the offer. The space agency’s website says bed rest studies give scientists information on how the body adapts to weightlessness. NASA spokesman William Jeffs tells the AP that the story is “absolutely untrue” and the agency hasn’t conducted bed rest studies for some time.

NOT REAL: Donald Trump Praises Colonel Sanders for His Service in the Civil War

THE FACTS: The post from admitted satire site The Red Schtick said the president praised the Kentucky Fried Chicken founder as a “tremendous Civil War hero” who once saved an army at Valley Forge from starvation. Sanders was born 25 years after the war’s end and died in 1980. The story circulated following Trump’s May 1 assertion in an interview that President Andrew Jackson could have prevented the war, which began 16 years after Jackson’s death.

NOT REAL: Bill Murray Reveals Why He’s Moving to Buffalo, New York

THE FACTS: Fans of Murray, Jennifer Aniston, Matt Damon or scores of other celebrities may be upset to know that the stars aren’t likely moving to a city near them. A series of stories posted on admitted hoax sites made up to look like local news outlets has celebrities moving to towns across North America, including Buffalo, New York; Janesville, Wisconsin; and Dothan, Alabama. Each story quotes the star mentioning that he or she is getting “a little tired of the L.A. lifestyle” and wants a big change in life.

``Our primary objective is to see Saddam Hussein and the leadership of the Iraqi regime indicted and prosecuted by an international criminal tribunal,″ David J. Scheffer, ambassador at large for war crimes, said Monday.

``It is beyond any possible doubt that Saddam Hussein and the top leadership around him have brutally and systematically committed war crimes and crimes against humanity for years,″ he said in a speech at the National Press Club.

World governments have been negotiating since 1997 the establishment of an International Criminal Court, which would be the world’s first permanent war crimes tribunal.

Establishment of the court could take at least two years, and it would lack jurisdiction over crimes committed earlier, Scheffer said.

That is why, he said, a special court is necessary to judge ``the continuing criminality″ of Saddam’s rule.

Special tribunals already are sitting in judgment over war crimes in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. At the request of the United States, the Yugoslavia panel has indicted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for crimes in the Balkans.

In its last months, the Clinton administration has stepped up an already vigorous campaign against Milosevic and Saddam, accusing the Serbian leader of intimidation and other tactics designed to ``steal″ Yugoslavia’s presidential election in November, and alleging countless human rights abuses and crimes by Saddam.

Getting a tribunal to hear charges against the Iraqi president would not be easy. Several members of the U.N. Security Council do not share the administration’s zeal to punish him.

Scheffer suggested as an alternative that a commission of experts could be appointed to judge Saddam and his associates. Or, he said, courts in various nations may be able to investigate and indict Iraqi government leaders.

Detailing what he said the United States knows about Saddam’s record, Scheffer said approximately 5,000 Iranians were killed by chemical weapons between 1983 and 1988 during the Iran-Iraq war, an estimated 5,000 Kurdish civilians died from chemical weapons in the Iraqi town of Halabja in 1988, and poison gas killed an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 Kurds in Iraq in 1987-1988.

Also, Scheffer said, during Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait in 1990-91 more than 1,000 Kuwaitis and nationals from other countries were killed, and Iraq committed war crimes against American service members.

Many civilians were among 30,000 to 60,000 Iraqis killed by Iraqi forces in suppressing an uprising that began in the south of the country in 1991, after the end of the Persian Gulf War in February. In addition, the country’s southern marshes were drained, beginning in the early 1990s, to deprive thousands of Iraqi Shiites of their livelihoods, Scheffer said.

The use of poison gas and the draining of the marshes are crimes against humanity, he said.

In the meantime, Scheffer said, Saddam has used murder, torture and, lately, rape in a campaign against political opponents. And, he said, Saddam is carrying out a systematic campaign of murder and intimidation of clergy.

``Like Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein did not commit these crimes on his own,″ Scheffer said. ``He has built up one of the world’s most ruthless police states, using a very small number of associates who share with him responsibility for these criminal actions.″

Such meticulously planned communities are generally thought to be a modern phenomenon, but a recent archaeological excavation near England’s Hamme-on-Rye unearthed a 14th-century document that suggests otherwise:

A covenant set to hand this Twelfth Day of June in the year of our Lord 1365 between the Manor by the Meadow Association of Freeholders and the owner in fee symple. Whereas the owner hath entered into this covenant in order to enjoye the especial liffestyle offered by the Manor and to avoid all unnecessary discord, the owner doth hereby acknowledge and acquiesce to certaine rules to ensure the faithful and serene enjoyment of the properties hereby governed, to witte:

Colour Of Abode

 In the interests of achieving a pleasing harmony and a clene appearance for the community, the colour of the exterior of each abode shall not be changed without leve. If leve be granted, the abode may then be peynted only with one of the following colours: riverbed clay grey, cow dung brown or farm field burnt umber.

Security

 A balliff charged with keeping the peace is authorized to settle disputes both publick and domestick. Manor hath further entered into contract with the Guild of Sorcerers to provide 24-hour, state-of-the-arte security to ward off the predations of trolls, hobgoblins and Frenchmen.

Safety Provisions

 Each abode shalt be provided with an exterior barrel. Said barrel must be kept full of water to assist in the dousing of fires whether started by the hand of man or mouth of dragon. Barrel water must not be used for drinking, bathing infants or drouning witches.

Lighting

 Manor hath provided torches throughout the community for the convenience of all. However, all torches must be extinguished by curfew and not reignited until the following dusk so as not to obscure viewing of God’s celestial firmament.

Clinic

 Manor doth operate a clinic at the barbershoppe to provide physic and the healing artes to all residents. Bledeing, leeches and the treatment of excess humours are available upon request. Herbes and medicines will be administered to those possessed of the supplementary potion plan. (Please note that neither exorcism nor treatment for curses is available on site.)

Business Prohibitions

 No owner is permitted to conduct a pryvat enterprise on the premises, whether as taverne keeper, trader in holy relics or seller of used oxcarts. Exceptions may be made for brewers and alchemists willing to share 30 percent of their production with the Association.

Gardens

 The owner shalt be permitted a garden wherein the following vegetables may be planted: oynouns, gourdes, garlec, lekes, letys and caboches. In addition, owners may cultivate herbes such as belladonna, nightshade and henbane for personal use—though the sale of such herbes is prohibited, owing to their properties for causing fevered hallucinations of the brain.

Weekly Entertainment

 Manor shalt provide weekly entertainment at the Commons on behalf of all residents. Forthcoming events include a joust tournament, the Hamme-on-Rye performance of “Punch & Judy Fight in the Crusades,” the observational humour of the stand-up Jester, Otto the Corpulent, and an elucidating lecture by Sir Charles Wentworth, founder and co-chair of the Flat Earth Society.

Refuse Removal

 Refuse shalt be removed on every Tuesday and Thursday. Homeowners should throw any mullok and other unwanted materials out of their windows to the footpath below. Barrels are available near the Commons for the recycling of parchment and chainmail.

Worse yet, it’s now testing psychological and technical support at 50 for the fourth time in 13 months, raising odds for a breakdown that brings the deep December 2018 at 42.36 into play.

As a consumer, you might think that cheap crude oil prices are great for the economy and your family’s bottom line. However, the contract is a highly-cyclical instrument that tracks economic expansion and contraction with surprising accuracy. Right now, the selloff is waving a red flag, telling us that energy traders are worried that world economies will enter recessionary waves as a result of China’s isolation and the potential escalation into other parts of the world.

More importantly from a technical standpoint, a decline into the 2018 low will mark the next phase in a massive 17-year descending triangle pattern, with support at the 2009 low in the lower 30s. The contract last tested that critical level in early 2016, breaking down into the mid-20s before reversing gears and remounting broken support. It’s failed to post a higher high in the last 4 years, maintaining a secular downtrend that’s now entered its 12th year.

Climate activists may view crude oil’s decline as a positive development, with more industries moving away from fossil fuels and into carbon-neutral energy sources. However, it’s unlikely that paradigm shift has reached critical mass, given healthy demand as a result of the multiyear economic expansion. In addition, dwindling crude oil resources around the world in coming years is likely to generate a premium for the commodity, with remaining users forced to pay up due to lower supply.

Fortunately, the evolution of crude oil prices has been moving at a snail’s pace, telling market players there’s plenty of time to take action if exposed to the industry through energy stocks or the futures markets. However, as we learned in 2008, contract volatility can escalate rapidly in response to system shocks like that year’s economic collapse, so it makes sense to keep a watch on price action at all times.

The contract soared from the mid-teens into the lower 40s in just 4 months in 1990, driven higher by the first Iraqi invasion. It settled back to earth a few months later, reentering a multiyear trading range that broke to the upside once again in 2004 when world economies were getting back on the feet after the burst Internet bubble. The uptrend went parabolic in 2006, driven by heavy speculation as a result of China’s multi-trillion dollar industrial expansion.

A vertical plunge followed 2008’s all-time high at 147.47, dropping the contract into a test at breakout support in the first quarter of 2009. It made steady progress into 2011, finally reversing a few points under the .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level. That marked the highest high in the last 9 years, ahead of a broad trading range that broke to the downside in 2014. That selloff printed the first lower monthly high for the contract in more than two decades.

The decline found support at the 2009 low at the start of 2016, giving way to a healthy uptick that stalled after President Trump fired the first shot of the trade war in 2018. It printed the second lower high in 7 years at that time, turning south at the .50 retracement of the 2-year slide. This downturn found support in the low 40s at the end of the year but the contract failed to make headway in 2019 and may be headed into a critical test at the 2016 low.

The WTI crude oil contract may have entered the next phase of a massive descending triangle pattern that forecasts much lower prices in coming decades.

It also mentions the directed process of selecting scapegoats and the exercise of power and abuse of it.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"These acts feel as if they’ve been imported from the past, and not just because of the atavism of destroying mankind’s newest technology with mankind’s oldest. Even the operating logic is medieval. Surely in well-educated Europe, plumb in the middle of the Information Age, no one should be buying these flimsy theories and marching off, petrol bombs in hand, to incinerate mobile towers?

History supplies a sharp parallel. Beginning in the middle of the 16th century, tens of thousands of men and women—women, for the most part—were killed for being witches. There had been similar executions before, but they took on new momentum around 1550, in the full flower of the Renaissance and all its attendant emphasis on rationality. Many of these people were burned; as with the 5G towers, the spectacle of destruction seemed as vital as the destruction itself. In 1613, for instance, at least 40 people in the southern Dutch town of Roermond were tried for bringing about blights in crops and the deaths of livestock and children. Found guilty, they were tied to stakes and burned to death. A couple dozen miles northwest lies the town of Liessel, where a cell phone tower was set alight in April.

It’s tempting to compare the material conditions of that bygone Europe with those of Europe today, and to find in those conditions some common origins for these infernal impulses.

The 16th century, too, was a time of immense flux. The climate had been shifting; a Little Ice Age was digging in, and Europe was hit by droughts and poor harvests. The plague was always around; a fierce flare of disease set in around Roermond in 1613, just when its authorities were conducting their witch trials.

The old, stable orders of society were breaking down. The Catholic Church was being challenged; feudalism was crumbling. The upheavals unsettled everyone. “Immense sadness and a feeling of doom pervaded the land,” the scholar Robert D. Anderson wrote. Historical concordances are always inexact, but the tenor of that time sounds acutely familiar to us. In both these periods of turbulence, people looked for someone to blame.

But the selection of scapegoats is a directed process, not a spontaneous one. It’s an exercise of power, and an abuse of it.

At the local level, the rich forestalled the rebellions of the poor by channeling their fear and anger toward purported witches. Across the Continent, the Catholic and Protestant churches were tussling for what two economists recently called “religious market share,” and the clerics of these two churches, each trying to claim the higher spiritual ground, promoted witch-hunting as a Christian activity. In Germany, where the contest between the churches grew most heated, at least 25,000 people were executed for witchcraft between 1500 and 1782.

Kings hired witch-hunters to preserve their power; demonologists climbed into official posts and used them to enlarge their line of work. One Catholic clergyman put out propaganda: a handbook on how to identify witches and what to do with them. The thing to do, he advised, was to use “green wood for the slow burning of the grossly impenitent.”

This is where the real echo lies—in the interests that drive the irrational mistrust of 5G towers.

As part of Moscow’s campaign to disrupt Western societies, Russian media outlets have been stoking 5G alarm with a flood of false facts, calling the technology a bearer of “wireless cancer.” Companies like Facebook and YouTube have been content to let wild plans for arson remain on their platforms for weeks. The irony is, of course, unmissable: These plans target the telecoms towers that are the very infrastructure of not only the Information Age but the Misinformation Age.

Politicians in Europe and the United States have fed the anxieties of their citizens as well. They’ve demonized Huawei, the Chinese company that builds 5G networks, and they’ve demonized China itself, for being the source of the coronavirus. And through their own lies and negligence, they’ve contributed more broadly to the formation of our polarized, suspicious, misinformed moment.

The historian Stuart Clark, in writing about witch trials, called them the product of an “age of cognitive extremism,” in which any contrarian idea was quickly labeled as the work of the devil. Rinse the religion out of that description, and it can be applied neatly to our world today. The firebugs going after 5G masts prove an essential and dangerous political truth. Spend enough energy turning people against each other, and you’ll be able to muster a mob with pitchforks and torches in any place, in any time."

But 500 years ago, Queen Elizabeth I made alliances with the Shah of Iran and the Ottoman Sultan. What can Elizabeth I’s relations with the Islamic world teach us?

A lot. They can teach us that there’s a form of pragmatic exchange and tolerance and accommodation, which trumps ideology. One of the key stories in the book is the issue of trade and the way trade collides with religions. The reason Queen Elizabeth develops this relationship with the Islamic world is theology initially. She’s establishing a Protestant state and England has become a pariah in Catholic Europe. So she reaches out for alliances with the Islamic world.

What flows from that is an exchange of trade and goods, regardless of sectarian and theological differences. Elizabeth is not reaching out to Sultan Murad III because she’s a nice person and wants religious accord. She is doing it for hard-nosed political and commercial reasons.

Elizabeth’s alliance with Murad III was essential to her self-preservation, yet this story has largely been left out of Tudor history. Why do you think that is?

In the last few years, there’s been a parochial identification of the Tudors, reflected in the way they have featured in recent TV shows, like The Tudors. It has become an index of Englishness, connected to whiteness and Christianity. But it never tells the wider story of what’s going on internationally. I started working on 16th-century maps and what the maps were telling me was that there was an exchange between the Islamic and Christian worlds, which wasn’t being told in the official histories.

Look at Tudor portraits. It’s all Orient pearls, silk from Iran, or cotton from the Ottoman territories. The English language changes, too. Words suddenly enter, like sugar, candy, crimson, turban, and tulip, which have Arabic or Persian roots. They all come in with the trade with the Islamic world."

All is well! As of last week, the S&P 500 was priced to achieve an average annual total return of just 5.83% over the coming decade, based on our standard methodology. Prior to 1995, the lowest implied 10-year total returns priced into the S&P 500 in post-war data were:

Note that in the 1987 case, the unusually strong 10-year return reflects a move to the extreme bubble valuations in the late 1990's, which have in turn been followed by 13 years of market returns below Treasury bill yields. Once the market becomes overvalued, further gains are ultimately paid for by a period of sorry returns later. To expect normal or above-average long-term returns from current prices is to rely on the market bailing out the rich overvaluation of today with extreme bubble valuations down the road.

While investors can hope that today is similar to August 1987, a moment's reflection about the market crash that occurred shortly after August 1987 might dampen that hope a bit, particularly because that instance also featured overbought, overbullish and rising-yield conditions.

Don’t throw your vote away if you live in a state that uses them. Ask for a paper ballot. Under federal law the polling place must provide one.



AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Soros, who donates to liberal political causes, does not own Smartmatic, a company that specializes in voting technology.

THE FACTS: A post circulating on Facebook featuring a photo of Soros and titled “Defeat Election Fraud” falsely claims he owns the company and names 16 states as places that use them. Three of the states _ Michigan, Missouri and Washington _ were conducting primaries on Tuesday. Similar false claims have circulated previously with posts dating as far back as 2016.

Michigan has three voting system vendors approved for the state, which are Dominion Voting Systems, Election Systems and Software and Hart InterCivic.

Samira Saba, a spokeswoman for Smartmatic, told The Associated Press in an email that Los Angeles County is currently the company’s only client in the U.S.

While the chairman of SmartMatics and the SGO Group, Mark Malloch-Brown, serves on the Open Society Foundations Global Board -- founded by George Soros -- SmartMatics is not owned by Soros himself, despite what the post circulating widely on social media suggested.



“Defeat election fraud! On election day, if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand, Demand a paper ballot. George Soro’s now owns SmartMatic. You have the right to require a paper ballot, and under Federal Law the polling place must provide one for you. Don’t throw your vote away,” the post stated. 



The company’s website, smartmatic.com, noted that “George Soros does not have and has never had any ownership stake in Smartmatic.” 



Smartmatic took part in its first U.S. election during the 2005-2006 election cycle where it offered its services to 16 states, according to their website.

This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform."

This means you cannot find it in physical notes or coins. Many companies have tried to create physical bitcoins, without success.

Bitcoins exist in the digital world of thousands of computers, organised in “blocks,” that process the transactions. The database technology underlying bitcoin is called blockchain – a type of software that works as an account ledger on computers all over the world.

An increasing number of entrepreneurs believe blockchain, which can circumvent the need for big financial intermediaries, will challenge traditional payment systems. Various banks are investing large sums to explore how blockchain could revolutionise payment systems and cut costs.

The currency also exists in the electronic wallets of people that possess bitcoins.

Payments are sent directly, securely and potentially anonymously between two people’s digital wallets, whereas all mainstream transactions, including those using intermediaries like Paypal and credit card lenders, run through banks and usually require named accounts and verification.

How can you get it?

Bitcoins are sold just like any other goods, via brokerages or trading exchanges, such as the Bitfinex from Hong Kong. You create your own “wallet” and then store, send, receive and exchange bitcoins.

In some cities you can find Bitcoin ATMs that load the ‘money’ onto your electronic wallet.

The easiest way to buy bitcoins is with hard cash, or your bank account. It is possible, but more difficult, to use credit cards or electronic platforms like PayPal.

Be careful: while changing fiat currency into bitcoins might be easy and cheap, the other way around is more challenging: you can face long delays and high transaction fees.

You can still “mine” it (i.e. use your computer to solve “blocks of information” and be rewarded in bitcoins). But you have to hurry because the reserves are running dry. Plus you might find out that the bitcoins you minted are worth less than you spend on electricity getting them.

How much does it cost?

Just like in any other market, prices vary. Headlines appeared worldwide when the price of bitcoin overtook the price of gold: bitcoin currently trades at around $1,210, compared with $1,210 for an ounce of gold.

Where can I use it?

As with a traditional currency, you can use it to buy goods and services, provided the stores and merchants accept bitcoin. It has become increasingly popular and large corporates like Dell, Microsoft and Bloomberg accept it. 

 There are online lists of stores that accept bitcoins.

Bitcoin purchases lack basic consumer protection mediums, though. So you won’t be given a receipt for your payment. But bitcoin is not famous for this traditional use. Its key to success is anonymity and the benefits that go with it.

In China, its major market, bitcoins are used to avoid capital controls and send money abroad.

In the past, bitcoins have been used for illegal transactions, such as drugs and arms trafficking in the online black market — and the first modern darknet market — Silk Road.

There is no such thing as a safe investment. Bitcoins bare the extra risk — or advantage, depending on your prespective — of not being regulated by any official state or governmental institution.

The price has fluctuated heavily in the past and might do so in the future. It is true though that it started from a price of a handful of dollars and now it has reached the price of gold.

Most analysts would say that is reasonable to take risks, as long as you understand the possible consequences.

With big risks comes the opportunities for big profits. See the example of Kristopher Koch-.

In Florida, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz exchanged the 10,000 Bitcoins he had mined for two piping-hot pizzas. If he had held onto them, his coins would have been easily worth over $4 million today.

Bitcoins are in most countries NOT illegal. It flies under the radar, like so many parts of the new era digital economy (Uber, Airbnb, etc). And like those, authorities try to regulate its market, but cannot embed it into the traditional economy.

Why is the decision important?

From a peculiarity of the “geek” or the “cryptoanarchy” community to the portfolio of the mainstream investor!

If the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) gives the green light to the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) of the Winklevoss brothers, this will be the first bitcoin investment vehicle to be approved by the federal regulatory body.

This means that everybody can take a chance with bitcoin, even if they do not even own a PC.

Your parents in the countryside, the pensioners in a village, small traders and institutions will be able to invest money in the hope that bitcoin will continue its record-breaking course."

Bush also knew, however, that Saddam had good reason for anticipating an ineffectual response. Only eight days before Saddam's army rumbled into Kuwait, U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie had told him, on instructions from the State Department, that Iraq's ""border differences"" with the tiny sheikdom were of no concern to the U.S. An outright takeover was another matter  but no U.S. official made that point to Saddam until after the fact. The American dog, Saddam assumed, would bark but never bite.

Bush, however, would prove him wrong. Against the initial judgment of many advisers, Bush was convinced that Saddam must be stopped now, before he became even more dangerous. Bush had been leafing through Martin Gilbert's The Second World War, and he cited Winston Churchill's view that World War II need not have been fought if Hitler had been thwarted in his 1936 push into the Rhineland, when he was weak enough to be deterred at relatively low cost.

Bush resolved that he, not Saddam, would shape the new world order emerging in the aftermath of the cold war. In this new order, the U.S. and the Soviet Union would work together through the U.N. to finally achieve the collective + security promised by the organization's founders in 1945. Bush thus found the ""vision,"" at least in foreign policy, that he has long lacked.

Bush recognized that the U.S., as the last remaining superpower, must continue to lead, but with a different style. It must accommodate the rise of the economic giants Germany and Japan, and of various regional powers, while coaxing the Soviet Union, despite its retrenchment, to play a constructive role. America, Bush reasoned, must lead through painstaking and often frustrating coalition building  precisely the sort of personal diplomacy and horse trading at which he has excelled in the gulf crisis.

At first, Bush turned to the U.N. mainly to provide diplomatic cover for the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia, as well as other Arab states reluctant to ally themselves with the ""U.S. imperialists."" But as the U.N. showed surprising backbone  first condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, then imposing a stifling trade embargo and authorizing the use of military force to back it up  Bush grew ever more respectful of the organization.

As he implemented his developing vision, Bush, unlike Ronald Reagan, was no lone cowboy singlehandedly dispensing rough justice but a sheriff rounding up a posse of law-abiding nations. If his style is multilateral, however, it is anything but open. In the gulf crisis, as elsewhere, he zealously guarded his real intentions and game plan. All along he has retained tight control of virtually every detail of U.S. action, revealing as little as possible about his plans to the American people and to Congress.

That approach, however, could ultimately undermine Bush's policy in the gulf. The President's penchant for secrecy, his cunning stratagems, his willingness to commit the world's most powerful nation to a course that he alone determines, helped him assemble the alliance. But those very qualities engender doubts in the mind of many Americans, who have learned from Watergate and Vietnam not to invest too much faith in any one man.

Focus on the Saudis

 In Paul Theroux's novella Doctor Slaughter, a young scholar at a dinner party observes that China's population has recently reached 1 billion. ""Wrong,"" tut-tuts another guest, an international banker. ""There are two people in China. And I know both of them.""

George Bush could make the same claim. After the invasion, the intimate knowledge of world leaders and world politics that he had acquired during his years as ambassador to the U.N., envoy to Beijing and CIA director helped him forge an unprecedented international alliance. Throughout, Bush has displayed an exquisite sensitivity to diplomatic nuance and the need for subtle compromise  and sometimes outright bribes  required to bring together such mutually suspicious bedfellows as Syria, Israel, Iran and the Soviet Union. His performance went beyond competence to sheer mastery.

The initial focus of Bush's diplomatic offensive was Saudi Arabia. Though the kingdom feared it might be next to fall to Saddam's rapacious army, King Fahd had grave reservations about seeking U.S. protection. The King, Bush knew, was leery of accepting non-Muslim troops, whose presence might provoke unrest among deeply xenophobic elements of the Saudi clergy and people. He also could not afford to have the conflict portrayed as Iraq and the Arab masses vs. the wealthy monarchs of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and their ""Western imperialist defenders.""

Until Aug. 2, Saddam, 54, seemed just another bloodthirsty despot. But he fancied himself another Nasser—the Egyptian leader who lost a war to Israel in 1967 but emerged an Arab hero nonetheless. That was high ambition for peasant-born Saddam, a failed assassin and jailbird before he took control of oil-rich Iraq in 1979. He cemented his rule by recruiting relatives and cronies from his native Tikrit, pampering the military and secret police, and purging enemies real or imagined (including a brother-in-law; small wonder Saddam’s favorite movie is The Godfather). Yet after he declared war on Iran in 1980, the Reagan and Bush administrations okayed $5 billion-plus in loans, some of it used to buy sensitive U.S. technology.

Do not ride in your neighbor’s saddle. Eight years of fighting left Iraq $70 billion in debt—and Saddam eyeing next-door Kuwait, which has but 600,000 citizens. Just how firmly Washington warned him against sending in troops is still being debated, but he needed under a day to complete his conquest. Saddam spent the fall digging in and issuing baroque threats—though on the eve of war Sajida Hussein, his first cousin, wife of 33 years and mother of his five children, reportedly fled (most likely for Mauritania); the fate of his mistress, Samira Shahbandar, is unclear.

He who lights a fire should not ask to be protected from the flame. Saddam is Iraq’s Commander in Chief, but, observes Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, “he is neither a strategist, nor is he schooled in the operational art, nor is he a tactician, nor is he a general, nor is he a soldier—other than that, he’s a great military man.” The 43-day war wrought grievous injury upon Iraq’s civilians, cities and armed forces (reportedly 100.000 dead). But it has not, as President Bush had hoped, led to Saddam’s overthrow. In fact, one opinion poll in April showed that a majority of Americans felt that the Allies had not triumphed because Saddam was still in power. And his subsequent take-no-prisoners suppression of Iraq’s Shiites and Kurds sadly calls to mind one last proverb: The lion’s den is never empty of bones."

WASHINGTON — Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, defended the group's repeated criticism of billionaire liberal donor George Soros in campaign ads on Sunday.

The National Republican Congressional Committee has been running ads in Minnesota's First Congressional District tying the Democratic candidate, Dan Feehan, to Soros. Feehan worked at the Center for New American Security, a think-tank that received funding from Soros.

The first ad, which began running the middle of this month, shows Soros sitting behind a pile of money as the words ""connoisseur of chaos"" show on the screen.

A more recent ad began running days after authorities found an explosive device sent to Soros's home, one of more than a dozen sent to Democratic officials and other critics of President Donald Trump.

When asked about the ads, Stivers noted that the group's independent expenditure staff, which creates the ads, is walled off from the rest of the committee leadership to comply with campaign finance laws. But he defended the ad as ""factual.""

""Our independent expenditure arm is independent. But that ad is factual. And it also has nothing to do with calling for violence. That ad is a factual ad,"" he said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

But the ad contains the kind of criticism that one prominent U.S. Jewish leader said can be evocative of anti-Semitic attacks.

""Political candidates and people in public life now literally repeat the the rhetoric of white supremacists,"" Anti Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said on ""Meet the Press.""

""And they think its normal and permissible to talk about Jewish conspiracies manipulating events or Jewish financiers controlling activities.""

While not specifically addressing the NRCC ads, Greenblatt said that ""the attacks on George Soros are appalling and the continued invocation of classic anti-Semitic themes.""

During Stivers's joint interview with his Democratic counterpart, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Ben Ray Luján, a New Mexico congressman, the two agreed that both sides have a role to play in tamping down political rhetoric.

But they both repeatedly criticized each other and their parties for their contributions to the political rhetoric.

Stivers noted that his group pulled its support of a New Jersey congressional candidate who repeatedly criticized diversity and shared racial comments on Twitter, in return accusing Democrats of backing candidates ""who have said bigoted and anti-Semitic things.""

""We all need to keep our dialogue civil,"" he said. ""We are the only major party committee to cut off a candidate for their behavior.""

""We all bear some responsibility. And we need to try to clean up our act and try to bring more civility to our Congress and, frankly, to our dialogue.""

In his criticism of the DCCC, Stivers specifically named Virginia Democrat Leslie Cockburn and Pennsylvania Democrat Scott Wallace.

Cockburn has been attacked for a book she wrote decades earlier that the New York Times review referred to as ""Israel-bashing for its own sake.""

Republicans have seized on that criticism to call Cockburn anti-Semitic, a charge that she denies by arguing she can be critical of Israel but still support it and Palestinians. She's also pointed to her endorsement from J Street, a liberal-leaning Jewish group.

Wallace has been dogged by a donation from his family foundation to a group that supports boycotting Israel to criticize its treatment of Palestinians. The controversy initially cost Wallace the endorsement of a local Jewish group, which later changed course and endorsed him.

Wallace, who has argued he had no direct control over the donation and opposes the boycotts, is also endorsed by J Street.

After Stivers criticized the DCCC for ""sleazy and personal"" ads against candidates in Colorado and Washington, Luján countered by calling some of the NRCC's attacks ""racist.""

""Steve, you've also been running racist ads in New York, in Cincinnati, Ohio and out in California. You can do something to pull those down,"" Luján said.

""I think, on all sides, that everyone should monitor the tone here. Again, no more finger pointing, Steve. Let's make sure that we look within ourselves and we find the greater good there.""

The Democrat's New York reference refers to the ads attacking Antonio Delgado, the Democratic candidate in New York's 19th Congressional District, that center on his earlier rap career."

The title of the address is billed as, “Renewing the Mandela Legacy and Promoting Active Citizenship in a Changing World”.

Given the state of leadership in the world, and the subject matter he’s chosen, the address is expected to be far more than just another political speech.

As we know, speeches can be much more than just an oral presentation. The timing, theme and energetic thrust of a political speech, if delivered through the spirit of a capable presenter, can have a major impact. It can alter international policy. Think here of Martin Luther King, Jr’s “I Have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. A speech can also promote and unleash international intolerance. Here Adolf Hitler’s speech at Munich on July 28, 1922 comes to mind.

This rhetorical reality requires something important from the speaker. To make history, define the present, and help shape the future with their words they need to be able to understand their personal and representational place in time and space.

My research for the past 11 years has yielded significant evidence that Obama is considerably capable of meeting the standards of a formidable public speaker. His rhetorical flexibility can be viewed as he seamlessly transitioned from a humorous monologue at the annual White House correspondence dinner into a serious display of gratitude for the men and women in journalism as he closed his address. Or, his ability to pivot into serious campaign fundraiser rhetoric shortly after crooning some classic Al Greene song.

There’s particular anticipation for the Johannesburg speech because it’s the first time he’s delivering a major address without the constraints of the title of president. The 2018 Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture therefore marks the first time many people will get the opportunity to witness Obama speaking, sans any current political position or known political aspirations.

My interest in the power and potential of Obama’s rhetoric is both personal and professional. I have been studying and writing about his speeches for over a decade, convinced that his voice is one of the most important of our generation.

My initial analysis of Obama’s rhetorical capabilities led to a doctoral dissertation titled, “Black Skin, White House, the rhetoric and symbolism of the first African American President of the United States”.

Obama, like few other historical figures, has successfully separated time with his achievement of becoming the first African American President of the United States. This glass ceiling cannot be reconstructed and shattered again. There will forever be the era before Obama and the periods that follow.

Only time will tell how significantly the Obama presidency changed history. Most peculiar perhaps will be the shifting political perceptions of those who elected Obama as part of their first presidential voting experience. There are also millions of young people throughout the world who have been impacted by the iconography of black family excellence which the Obama’s consistently exuded with poise, depth and intelligence.

In the proverbial pantheon of great orators, I believe that he is just one tier below the greatest rhetoricians on record. For example, Reverend King and Mandela are top tier speakers, then Obama is on the level just below these historic communicators.

Obama is making his speech in a changing world dominated by the often outrageous utterances of his successor, US President Donald Trump. Few recent political changes have garnered the level of attention as the seemingly stark contrast between Obama and Trump.

People throughout the world may be eagerly awaiting Obama’s perspective on American politics today. That’s of course whether or not he will address the incumbent directly.

The ripple effect of American political engagement continues to have global impacts. The current international political climate has created an increased hunger for a sincere and tangible revival of the legacy of activism in pursuit of justice. This need comes tempered with a genuine appreciation for peace and reconciliation which Mandela so powerfully embodied.

It’s also significant that Obama will deliver the lecture on African soil. Africa is the home of Obama’s deceased father whose impact was described in the former president’s powerful memoir titled, “Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance”.

The visit to South Africa will mark Obama’s continued efforts to live out those dreams while also endeavouring to realise the dreams of Mandela.

Not only is this likely to feature Obama’s lecture, but we are likely to be introduced to the next phase of Obama’s leadership.

Pessimists may doubt the potential positive effects of inspirational rhetoric. They may also be sceptical of the power of the Nelson Mandela Foundation to encourage greater global reconciliation and positive political engagement in the tradition of the foundation’s namesake. To them I humbly submit that they pay close attention to Obama’s address.

I also urge them to remember Mandela’s words when he walked out a free man on 11 February 1990, after 27 years locked up in apartheid’s prisons. He cited our obligation to future generations to speak and act boldly:"

It also suggests that the bank's actions are not widely known or understood by the public.","Goldman Sachs is one of the largest investment banks in the world. It gained notoriety for the huge profits it made during the 2008 financial crisis, from “betting” on a collapse in the sub-prime mortgage market. Documentary “Goldman Sachs: Master of the World?” claims that the bank’s insider status with governments, including the US, has made sure it has not seen repercussions from the massive global collapse.

The 2011 Amazon Prime documentary delves into how the banking house, founded in 1869 by a German immigrant to the States, became one of the most powerful banks in the world. Chris Hedges, the author of “The World As It Is”, speaks about how Goldman Sachs personnel are key players in the American political system. He says there are a “huge number” of former Goldman Sachs partners in US politics. “Really, it is fair to say that in this country it is impossible to vote against the interests of Goldman Sachs,” he adds.

Former Goldman Sachs employees in key global political positions currently include United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. Hedges continues: “Goldman Sachs has the power to bring down economies, as they have in Greece.” The bank is said to have made as much as $500m from advising the Greek government on complex investments deals, designed to make the country’s debt look smaller than it was. “When they declare a particular government insolvent, the consequences are drastic because they force the government – in order to continue to be able to borrow money – to impose the kind of austerity measures that have crippled Greek society and which are crippling the United States,” continues Hedges.

“We’re all hostage to this game of speculation.” The documentary interviewer goes on to ask Hedges about the US Senate hearing, which called Goldman Sachs executives before an investigative committee. In 2010, CEO Lloyd Blankfein and executive Fabrice Tourre gave evidence on the bank's trading during the 2008 credit crisis. The New York Times characterised Goldman Sachs dealings during the crisis as: ""A series of complex deals to profit from the collapse of the home mortgage market.” However, Hedges dismisses the hearing as “political theatre"", adding: “As soon as the lights go out and the cameras leave, these people all go to lunch.”

The public image of the bank was severely damaged after the Senate hearing, and the firm was fined $550million for its actions during the financial crisis. However Hedges says that there were no real consequences for Goldman Sachs, which is carrying on business as usual. “Since the collapse of 2008, these institutions are untouchable. We can’t do anything to stop them,” he says. “They have looted the US Treasury, and are engaging in the same kind of speculation – casino capitalism – that they engaged in before the bubble deflated, wiping out 17 trillion dollars in wages and savings of small shareholders and ordinary Americans. “These people are criminals. In the 17th century, speculators were hanged.”"

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index climbed 3.2%, its best day since early April. The gains erased all of its losses from last week, when the index posted its worst showing since late March and its third weekly loss in the last four. Bond yields rose broadly, another sign of investor optimism.

Stocks were already headed for a higher opening on Wall Street when a drug company announced encouraging results in very early testing of an experimental coronavirus vaccine. The stock of the company, Massachusetts-based Moderna, jumped 20%.

Investors were also encouraged by remarks over the weekend from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell, who expressed optimism that the U.S. economy could begin to recover in the second half of the year. Once the outbreak has been contained, he said, the economy should be able to rebound “substantially.”

The S&P 500 climbed 90.21 points to 2,953.91. The benchmark index is still down 12.8% from the all-time high it reached in February.

The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 911.95 points, or 3.9%, to 24,597.37. The Nasdaq composite rose 220.27 points, or 2.4%, to 9,234.83. Small-company stocks fared better than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index surged 76.70 points, or 6.1%, to 1,333.69.

Investors are hoping that a working vaccine for COVID-19 can be developed and that it will help reassure people and businesses as the economy reopens.

“The question of how quickly people come back, or will they come back to the way they used to do things — that’s much different if you have a vaccine,” said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors.

Traders are also encouraged that, so far at least, there hasn’t been a lot of data implying the reopening of the economy will lead to a resurgence in the number of COVID-19 cases, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.

“Of course,” he said, “we could end up giving back some of these gains should additional information contest our beliefs.”

Technology, financial and industrial stocks accounted for a big slice of Monday’s broad gains, along with companies that rely on consumer spending. And energy stocks rose as the price of U.S. crude oil closed above $30 a barrel for the first time in two months. Oil production cuts are kicking in at the same time that demand is rising as the U.S. and other countries ease some of the restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the virus.

Benchmark U.S. crude oil for June delivery jumped 8.1% to settle at $31.82 a barrel. July Brent crude oil, the international standard, vaulted 7.1% to $34.81 a barrel.

Bonds yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 0.72% from 0.64%.

Fears of a crushing recession due to the coronavirus sent the S&P 500 into a skid of more than 30% from its February peak. Hopes for a relatively quick rebound and unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve and Congress to stem the economic pain fueled a historic rebound for stocks in April.

May got off to a downbeat start as investors balance cautious optimism of a recovery as economies around the world slowly open up again against worries that the moves could lead to another surge in coronavirus infections and more economic uncertainty. But Monday’s strong start to the week reversed all of the market’s losses so far this month.

“We had a near 30% advance from the March 23 low to April 17, and then basically treaded water for a month as investors were expecting some sort of a retest of the prior low, which obviously did not come,” Stovall said. “Usually, markets need to catch their breath after a sprint higher.”

Wall Street is hoping that the reopening of businesses and the relaxation of stay-at-home mandates continue without any major setbacks, paving the way for corporate profits to bounce back.

Europe has been taking steps to reopen its economy more widely, and so far, new infections and deaths have slowed considerably across the continent. Some countries there started easing lockdowns a month ago and even the harshest shutdowns — such as those in Italy and Spain — have loosened significantly.

Markets in Europe and Asia also climbed Monday."

Indeed, a new report estimates that the pandemic will likely last about two years.

The , from researchers at the University of Minnesota, draws on information from eight previous going back to the 1700s, and incorporates data from the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The authors note that the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, is not a type of influenza, but it shares some similarities with pandemic flu viruses — both are respiratory viruses to which the population has little to no previous immunity, and both can spread when people don't have symptoms. Still, the virus causing COVID-19 appears to spread more easily than the flu, and may account for a greater proportion of COVID-19's spread, compared with the flu.

Related: How does the new coronavirus compare with the flu?

Given how easily SARS-CoV-2 spreads, about 60% to 70% of the population may need to be immune in order to achieve ""herd immunity"" and bring a stop to the pandemic, the authors said. This will take time, since a relatively small fraction of the U.S. population seems to have been infected so far (although infection rates vary by location), according to studies looking at antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples.

The report then outlines three potential scenarios for how the COVID-19 pandemic could play out.
• Scenario 1: In this scenario, the current wave of COVID-19 cases is followed by a series of smaller waves, or ""peaks and valleys,"" that occur consistently over a one- to two-year period, but gradually diminish sometime in 2021.
• Scenario 2: Another possibility is that the initial wave of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020 is followed by a larger wave of cases in the fall or winter, as happened with the . Subsequently, one or more smaller waves could occur in 2021.
• Scenario 3: Finally, the initial spring wave of COVID-19 could be followed by a ""slow burn"" of COVID-19 transmission and cases that doesn't follow a clear wave pattern, the authors said.

During new ""waves"" of cases, areas may need to periodically reinstate and relax mitigation measures, such as social distancing, to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed with cases, the authors said.

Globally, there were more than seven million coronavirus infections Wednesday, including more than 400,000 deaths.

Latest reports Wednesday put the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Africa at more than 200,000, including 5,000 deaths. World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, notes it took 98 days to reach the first 100,000 cases and only 19 days to move to 200,000 cases.

“So, even though these cases in Africa account for less than three percent of the global total, it is clear that the pandemic is accelerating,” Moeti said. ""Ten of the 54 countries in Africa are currently driving the numbers, and they account for 75 percent of the total cases. Five countries account for 71 percent of the total deaths.”

South Africa has the largest number of cases and deaths. Data show the majority of coronavirus deaths in the region follow a similar trend to that seen in Europe and the United States. That is, most who die are over age 60 and have underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity.

The pandemic arrived in Africa in February, later than in other parts of the world. Moeti says this gave countries precious time to prepare for the onset of the crisis. She says the experience gained from combatting deadly diseases such as Ebola and HIV/AIDS has enabled countries to quickly scale up their health operations.

She says lockdowns and other social measures such as social distancing, were quickly put in place. She says these public health measures have been effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in Africa.

“However, stay-at-home orders and closing of markets and businesses, have taken a heavy economic toll, particularly on the most vulnerable and marginalized communities, and we know that many African people work in the informal sector of the economy…So, the need to balance between saving lives and protecting livelihoods is a key consideration in this response, and particularly so in Africa,” Moeti said.

Africa faces many challenges. Moeti says one of the biggest is the lack of test kits and other supplies. She notes many essential health services are being neglected because of the focus on the pandemic. For example, she says vaccine preventable disease campaigns and regular immunizations against killer diseases have been reduced.

She expects Africans will have to live with a steady increase of COVID-19 until there is access to an effective vaccine. However, she says the disease probably could be managed so health systems are not overrun by people who are ill, if Africa gets the supplies and other international support it needs."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). HPV is the virus that causes genital warts.

Besides genital warts, an HPV infection can cause these other problems:
• In females, it can cause problems with the that may lead to cervical cancer. HPV infection also can lead to cancer in the vagina, vulva, anus, mouth, and throat.
• In males, HPV infection may lead to cancer in the penis, anus, mouth, and throat.
• New research suggests that HPV may be linked to heart disease in women.

Both girls and guys can get HPV from sexual contact, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Most people infected with HPV don't know they have it because they don't notice any signs or problems. People do not always get genital warts, but the virus is still in their system and could cause damage. This means that people with HPV can pass the infection to others without knowing it.

Because HPV can cause problems like genital warts and some kinds of cancer, a vaccine is an important step in preventing infection and protecting against the spread of HPV.

That's why doctors recommend that all girls and guys get the vaccine from age 11 or 12 through age 26. If needed, kids can get the vaccine starting at age 9.

How Does the HPV Vaccine Work?

The HPV vaccine is recommended for people 9 to 26 years old:
• For kids and teens ages 9–14, the vaccine is given in 2 shots over a 6- to 12-month period.
• For teens and young adults (ages 15–26), it's given in 3 shots over a 6-month period.

It works best when people get all their shots on time. If you're under age 26 and you've missed a shot, you can still catch up. Just ask your doctor about the best way to do that.

The vaccine does not protect people against strains of HPV that might have infected them before getting the vaccine. The most effective way to prevent HPV infection is to get vaccinated before having sex for the first time. But even if you have had sex, don't give up on getting the vaccine. It's still the best way to protect against strains of the virus that you may not have come in contact with.

The vaccine doesn't protect against all types of HPV. Anyone having sex should get routine checkups at a doctor's office or health clinic. Girls should get Pap smears when a doctor recommends it — usually around age 21 unless there are signs of a problem before that.

The HPV vaccine is not a replacement for using condoms to protect against other strains of HPV — and other STDs — when having sex.

What Are the Side Effects of the HPV Vaccine?

Side effects that people get from the HPV vaccine usually are minor. They may include swelling or pain at the injection site, or feeling faint after getting the vaccine. As with other vaccines, there is a small chance of an allergic reaction.

A few people have reported health problems after getting the shot. The FDA is monitoring the vaccine closely to make sure these are not caused by the vaccine itself.

Most people have no trouble with the vaccine. You can make fainting less likely by sitting down for 15 minutes after each shot.

How Can I Protect Myself From HPV?

For people who have sex, condoms offer some protection against HPV. Condoms can't completely prevent infections because hard-to-see warts can be outside the area covered by a condom, and the virus can infect people even when a partner doesn't have warts. Also, condoms can break.

The only way to be completely sure about preventing HPV infections and other STDs is not to have sex (abstinence). Spermicidal foams, creams, and jellies aren't proven to protect against HPV or genital warts.

If you have questions about the vaccine or are worried about STDs, talk to your doctor."

WHO, on the recommendation of GACVS, commissioned a literature review by an independent researcher of the risk of autism associated with MMR vaccine; the outcome of the review was presented to GACVS for its consideration.

Autistic spectrum disorder represents a continuum of cognitive and neurobehavioral disorders including autism. The prevalence of autism varies considerably with case ascertainment, ranging from 0.7 – 21.1 per 10 000 children (median 5.2 per 10 000) while the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder is estimated to be 1 - 6 per 1000. Eleven epidemiological studies (representing the most recent studies, mostly in the last 4 years) were reviewed in detail, taking into consideration study design (including ecologic, case control, case-crossover and cohort studies) and limitations. The review concluded that existing studies do not show evidence of an association between the risk of autism or autistic disorders and MMR vaccine. Three laboratory studies were also reviewed. It was concluded that the alleged persistence of measles vaccine virus in the gastrointestinal tract of children with autism and inflammatory bowel disease requires further investigation through independent studies before the laboratory findings of the published studies, which have serious limitations, can be considered confirmed.

Based on the extensive review presented, GACVS concluded that no evidence exists of a causal association between MMR vaccine and autism or autistic disorders. The Committee believes the matter is likely to be clarified by a better understanding of the causes of autism. GACVS also concluded that there is no evidence to support the routine use of monovalent measles, mumps and rubella vaccines over the combined vaccine, a strategy which would put children at increased risk of incomplete immunization. Thus, GACVS recommends that there should be no change in current vaccination practices with MMR.

While congressional oversight committees got some briefings during the U.S.-backed Contra wars of the 1980s, ``CIA did not inform Congress of all allegations″ linking Contras to drug trafficking, the CIA Inspector General L. Britt Snider concluded.

``No information has been found to indicate that any U.S. law enforcement entity or executive branch agency was informed by CIA of drug trafficking allegations″ concerning 11 Contra-related individuals who worked with the CIA, the report said.

The 410-page declassified version of the report, posted on the CIA’s Web site late Thursday, provides new insights into U.S. intelligence during the Reagan years as it aided the anti-Communist Nicaraguan Contra forces. Throughout those years, House and Senate Democrats _ then the majority party in Congress _ regularly questioned the CIA about persistent rumors that the Contras were trafficking in narcotics to finance their effort to overthrow the Sandinista government.

In classified briefings on Capitol Hill, CIA officials typically acknowledged only one major case of narcotics involvement by an anti-Sandinista group _ the so-called ADREN 15th of September group, which had been disbanded in 1982. But the newly declassified report links to drug allegations 58 other individuals belonging to various Contra groups.

For example, the CIA had information linking 14 pilots and two other individuals involved in transport to drug trafficking. In 1984, the CIA broke off contact with one member of the Contra Sandino Revolutionary Front linked to known drug trafficker Jorge Morales but ``continued to have contact through 1986-87 with four of the (other) individuals involved with Morales,″ the report said.

In the fall of 1986 and all of 1987, Congress prohibited the Reagan administration from funding any Contra group with members known to be involved in drug smuggling. In response, the IG report says, the CIA did not investigate such allegations and thus avoided invoking the funding cutoff.

At a time when CIA files contained numerous cases of suspected drug trafficking by Contra-connected individuals, Alan Fiers, then chief of the CIA’s Central American Task Force, was telling the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1987, ``We have uncovered no indications that any of these individuals are involved or have been involved in narcotics trafficking.″

In 1988, Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., were pressuring John Helgerson, the CIA’s chief liaison to Congress, to produce information on alleged Contra drug activity. In a memo to senior CIA officials, Helgerson wrote, ``Realistically, we are likely to have to respond somehow _ fairly quickly _ to the Kerry and Pell requests regarding when we knew what.″ But Helgerson advised against passing on ``raw reporting or operational traffic″ to the lawmakers.

The CIA apparently had allies on the Senate Intelligence Committee who ``were not ‘taken’ with the topic and were very frustrated by the tasking from Senators Kerry and Pell,″ the IG report said. Current CIA Director George Tenet and Inspector General Snider were then on the committee’s staff.

Then-acting CIA Director Robert Gates did try to get tough regarding contacts with drug traffickers. The IG report describes an April 9, 1987, memo from Gates to his operations chief, Clair George. Gates said it was ``absolutely imperative″ that the CIA and its Central American operatives ``avoid any kind of involvement with individuals or companies that are even suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking.″ Apparently the memo never made it past George.

``No information has been found to indicate that this memorandum, in its entirety, was disseminated to anyone at CIA headquarters other than DDO George,″ the report states.

This IG report grew out of a CIA inquiry following a newspaper series that alleged a connection between the agency and Contra-connected crack cocaine dealers. The CIA has disavowed any such connection, and the inspector general did as well in an earlier report."

Fresh from dumping two dead bodies in a river, Pat sets his eyes on another enemy in tonight's double-bill.

The scheming builder tried to make Seb think that Anna Windass had deliberately tried to kill him by causing his ladder to collapse.

With Seb unconscious in the hospital, Phelan dripped poison in his ear and whispered his shocking lies to try and get Anna done for murder.

The soap villain, who forced Andy Carver to kill Vinny Ashford before turning the gun on his prisoner, came to Seb's bedside to carry out his next twisted move.

Leaning in towards Seb, he muttered: ""Anna Windass hates you, she wants you dead. You hear me. Anna Windass wants you dead. She pushed you off that ladder.""

Pheland proved to have amazing powers of persuasion, as his Jedi mind trick really did convince Seb that it was Anna that pushed him off the ladder.

Once Seb woke up, he revealed to Faye that Anna was the one that caused him to fall.

Seb said: ""Anna wants me dead. She pushed me off that a ladder.""

Viewers know that this is not the case as Anna was walking out of the cafe at the time.

However, Faye phoned the police and grassed her own mum up.

Corrie viewers took to Twitter after seeing Pat's amazing powers of persuasion.

One viewer said: ""Was enjoying the Phelan storyline but getting into Seb’s mind is utter bollox #Corrie""

Another added: ""Phelan can do cunjouring mind manipulation?! Diabolical storyline. #corrie""

Carne Ross, who was a first secretary at the United Nations in New York for the Foreign Office until 2004, told MPs: ""A lot of facts about the run-up to this war have yet to come to light which should come to light and which the public deserves to know."" There were also assessments by the joint intelligence committee which had not been disclosed, Ross told the Commons public administration select committee.

He told the inquiry that the intelligence made it ""very clear"" that Saddam Hussein did not pose a significant threat to the UK, as was being claimed at the time by ministers, and that tougher enforcement of sanctions could have brought his regime down.

He said he tried to inform ministers about his misgivings over the developing momentum towards war, taking them aside during their visits to New York or having brief conversations in their car to the airport.

But he said he was aware that speaking out too often or too openly - even in internal debates - about his concerns about the government's policy direction would damage his career by winning him a reputation as a ""naive troublemaker"".

Ross's evidence, by video link from New York, came days after Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time, used the first ministerial veto under the freedom of information act to ban the release of cabinet minutes on the decision to go to war.

""I feel very strongly that there has still not been proper accountability and scrutiny into what happened in Iraq,"" Ross said.

""There should be a full public inquiry or parliamentary inquiry into the decision-making that took place. Hutton and Butler are by no means sufficient to that purpose and it is disgraceful that the government pretends that they are... if we had those systems of accountability and scrutiny then leaking and other more aberration behaviour from civil servants would be less necessary.""

He was one of four ""whistleblowers"" who yesterday gave evidence to the committee.

They also included Katharine Gun, a former GCHQ translator who revealed the organisation was tapping phones of countries that were against the Iraq war; Brian Jones, the most senior expert on chemical weapons at the Defence Intelligence Staff; and Derek Pasquill, a former Foreign Office official who leaked documents about rendition and Muslim groups who were hostile to the UK receiving government money.

Jones and Ross never leaked any information to the press. Jones instead complained to his superior that he thought the intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction was being exaggerated but was told that there was ""one secret piece of information which could not be shared with [him]"" because it was too sensitive.

He told MPs that when the WMD dossier was published and he saw the difference between the foreword by the prime minister and the contents he ""thought the intelligence services were going to be crucified"".

But he instead he found that most MPs, with a few exceptions, supported the government. ""I feel that you gentlemen [the MPs] have been either deliberately or accidentally misled and these incidents have not been followed up. I think that there has been a great laxity and that won't encourage people like me or my colleagues to come to you,"" he said.

Tony Wright, the chairman of the committee, agreed with the allegation. ""I think you are absolutely right to castigate parliament, which I think has behaved abysmally in this matter - endless bleating about the need for an inquiry but a complete failure to insist upon one,"" he said.

Gordon Brown has promised to look at an inquiry after all the troops come home from Iraq."

While overall investor sentiment in 2019 was hesitant and bearish, institutional investors in 2020 now embrace the stark reality that there are not enough new domestic sources in development of the raw materials that will fuel the renewable energy revolution. Certain funds, like Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, are taking a forward-looking approach at both the mining required, and also the extraction processes of those key materials. The time between mining of materials and them being available to enter the supply is multiple years in the making.

“The market is starting to realize that while there’s enough lithium to meet today’s short-term demand, overall demand will quadruple in this decade,” said American Battery Metals Corporation Chief Executive Officer, Doug Cole. “And the acute need for resources goes beyond simply developing new mining projects of critical materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Advanced extraction techniques are also required to shorten the time from the mining of such materials to them being deployed into the supply chain- and the process must also be environmentally-friendly and sustainable.”

American Battery Metals Corporation Head of Business Development and Government Affairs, Doug Nickle, says, “the renewable energy revolution necessitates a multifaceted, innovative approach for what he refers to as the “green in, green out” transition. It isn’t really an environmentally sound energy transition if the mining and extraction of raw materials is bad for the environment and there isn’t a sustainable plan to deal with the resulting e-waste created by lithium-ion battery systems.”

Cole continued, “That’s why American Battery Metals Corporation is unique- we are the only fully integrated advanced technology energy company covering the beginning and end of life- and everything in between- for battery metals raw materials. We provide solutions for the market’s upstream and downstream needs through our leading-edge lithium-ion recycling process, proprietary extraction technology, and resource production divisions.”

Each of American Battery Metals Corporations’ strategic verticals addresses the burgeoning need for battery metals, and the company is rapidly establishing itself as a nimble market leader.

American Battery Metals Corporation ( www.batterymetals.com ) (OTCQB: ABML ) is an American-owned, advanced extraction and battery recycling technology company with valuable mineral resources in Nevada. The company is focused on its lithium-ion battery recycling and resource production projects in Nevada, with the goal of becoming a substantial domestic supplier of battery metals to the rapidly growing electric vehicle and battery storage markets.

• Atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus): 90
• Atomic symbol (on the Periodic Table of Elements): Th
• Number of natural isotopes (atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons): 1. There are also at least 8 radioactive isotopes created in a lab.

In 1815, Jöns Jakob Berzelius, a Swedish chemist, first thought he had discovered a new Earth element, which he named thorium after Thor, the Norse god of war, according to Peter van der Krogt, a Dutch historian. In 1824, however, it was determined that the mineral was in fact yttrium phosphate.;

In 1828, Berzelius received a sample of a black mineral found on Løvø Island off the coast of Norway by Hans Morten Thrane Esmark, a Norwegian mineralogist. The mineral contained nearly 60 percent of an unknown element, which took over the name thorium; the mineral was named thorite. The mineral also contained many known elements, including iron, manganese, lead, tin, and uranium, according to Chemicool.

Berzelius isolated thorium by first mixing thorium oxide found in the mineral with carbon to create thorium chloride, which was then reacted with potassium to yield thorium and potassium chloride, according to Chemicool.

Gerhard Schmidt, a German chemist, and Marie Curie, a Polish physicist, independently discovered that thorium was radioactive in 1898 within a couple months of each other, according to Chemicool. Schmidt is often credited with the discovery.

Ernest Rutherford, a New Zealand physicist, and Frederick Soddy, an English chemist, discovered that thorium decays at a fixed rate into other elements, also known as the half-life of an element, according to Los Alamos National Laboratory. This work was critical in furthering the understanding of other radioactive elements.

Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Handrik de Boer, both Dutch chemists, isolated high purity metalic thorium in 1925, according to Los Alamos National Laboratory.
• In its liquid state, thorium has a greater temperature range than any other element, with nearly 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit (3,000 degrees Celsius) between melting and boiling points, according to Chemicool.
• Thorium dioxide has the highest melting point of all known oxides, according to Chemicool.
• Thorium is about as abundant as lead and at least three times as abundant as uranium, according to Lenntech.
• The abundance of thorium in Earth's crust is 6 parts per million by weight, according to Chemicool. According to Periodic Table, thorium is the 41st most abundant element in Earth's crust.
• Thorium is mainly mined in Australia, Canada, the United States, Russia and India, according to Minerals Education Coalition.
• Trace levels of thorium are found in rocks, soil, water, plants and animals, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
• Higher concentrations of thorium are typically found in minerals such as thorite, thorianite, monazite, allanite, and zircon, according to Los Alamos National Laboratory.
• The most stable isotope of thorium, Th-232, has a half-life of 14 billion years, according to the EPA.
• According to Los Alamos, thorium is created in the cores of supernovae and then scattered across the galaxy during the explosions.
• Thorium had been used since 1885 in gas mantles, which provide the light in gas lamps, according to Los Alamos. Due to its radioactivity, the element has been replaced by other nonradioactive rare-earth elements.
• Thorium is also used to strengthen magnesium, coating tungsten wire in electrical equipment, controlling the grain size of tungsten in electric lamps, high-temperature crucibles, in glasses, in camera and scientific instrument lenses, and is a source of nuclear power, according to Los Alamos.
• Other uses for thorium include heat-resistant ceramics, aircraft engines, and in light bulbs, according to Chemicool.
• According to Lenntech, thorium was used in toothpaste until radioactivity dangers were discovered.
• Thorium and uranium are involved in the heating of Earth's interior, according to Minerals Education Coalition.
• Too much thorium exposure can cause lead to lung disease, lung and pancreatic cancer, alter genetics, liver disease, bone cancer, and metal poisoning, according to Lenntech.

A great deal of research is going into using thorium as a nuclear fuel. According to an article from the Royal Society of Chemistry, thorium used in nuclear reactors provide many benefits over using uranium:
• Thorium is three to four times more abundant than uranium.
• Thorium is more easily extracted than uranium.
• Liquid fluoride thorium reactors (LFTR) have very little waste compared with reactors powered by uranium.
• LFTRs run at atmospheric pressure instead of 150 to 160 times atmospheric pressure currently needed.
• Thorium is less radioactive than uranium.

According to a 2009 paper by NASA researchers Albert J. Juhasz, Richard A. Rarick, and Rajmohan Rangarajan, thorium reactors were developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s under the direction of Alvin Weinberg for supporting nuclear aircraft programs. The program stopped in 1961 in favor of other technologies. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, thorium reactors were abandoned because they did not produce as much plutonium as uranium-powered reactors. At that time, weapons-grade plutonium, as well as uranium, was a hot commodity due to the Cold War.

Thorium itself is not used for nuclear fuel, but it is used to create the artificial uranium isotope uranium-233, according to the NASA report. Thorium-232 first absorbs a neutron, creating thorium-233, which decays to protactium-233 over the course of about four hours. Protactium-233 slowly decays to uranium-233 over the course of about ten months. Uranium-233 is then used in nuclear reactors as fuel.

Bush and a massive entourage came to London this week (November 18) for a rare state visit. Even before he arrived the trip provoked fury, with reports that US security officials wanted to create a three mile ‘exclusion zone’ around him, effectively shutting down central London and stopping legitimate protesters from getting anywhere near the President.

Angry at what he sees as using the “threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose”, Thom Yorke e-mailed NME last week, urging people to protest against the visit.

When asked why he’d chosen to speak out, Thom told NME: “To make Blair squirm over his decision to take us into a illegitimate war (In Iraq) and follow this religious lunatic (Bush) toward a dangerous future for the whole planet.

“Both of these men are liars. We have right to call them such, they are putting our children’s future in jeopardy. They are not controlling the terrorist threat, they are escalating it. Blair will not be allowed off the hook by his pathetic pleading for us to ‘move on’, neither shall Bush.”

Thom continued: “(The visit) will be heavily staged I think. I expect they will use the threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose, intimidate and arrest whoever they wish. The majority of British people were against this war, and Bush’s visit will just taint Blair even further.”

While in the UK Bush will be staying in Buckingham Palace. Yorke urged the Royal Family to “do something useful” and protest too. He continued: “This is a royal invitation isn’t it? How about one of the little heirs to throne doing something useful with their lives and speaking out? Refusing to shake hands for example? As we are still awaiting the results of the Hutton Inquiry I think now is a good time to remind Blair that he’s on very very very very very very very very thin ice.”

Anti-war protesters Damon Albarn and Robert ‘3-D’ Del Naja have also spoken out. 3-D told NME.COM: “The state visit of George Bush is an insult to the entire nation. The daily death and chaos in Iraq is escalating. This visit divides our people and our communities. The war on terror has only created more anger, more frustration and more militants. And the country continues to evolve into a future target for extremists.”

Albarn added: “We are still at war. We are still good at watching war. What does watching war tell us about ourselves? How does war lead to peace? How does watching war lead to peace? Two million people asked a question on February 15 – Why War? We haven’t had an answer yet.”

Travis singer Fran Healy also contacted NME.COM. He said: “Terrible timing from our government. WHY NOW? How insensitive is this? Nothing surprises me any more. The whole thing stinks. A three-mile bubble. Impressive. And the great thing is- we pay for it. We pay for all of it and we’ll keep paying in money and in lives for a long time to come. I wonder if Bush realises he’s the most unpopular man in the world. That is some feat. How does that feel? I am interested to see what happens. The police are gonna have their jobs cut out for them.”

That is how long it took for confirmed coronavirus infections to reach the 100,000 mark in Africa. But when it came to those cases doubling up to 200,000, it took just 18 days.

The figures were cited by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday as it warned that the coronavirus pandemic on the continent is ""accelerating"", with the virus spreading to rural areas after international travellers brought it to major cities.
• Opinion: The problem with predicting coronavirus apocalypse in Africa

""Even though these cases in Africa account for less than 3 percent of the global total, it's clear that the pandemic is accelerating,"" WHO Africa head Matshidiso Moeti told a media briefing.

Moeti said community transmission had begun in more than half of Africa's 54 countries, calling that ""a serious sign"".

More than 5,500 coronavirus-related deaths have been confirmed so far across the continent.

As the virus, which first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December of last year, swept across the globe, many experts had warned of a possible dire effect on countries in Africa, which contains many of the world's poorest countries, weak healthcare infrastructure, and millions of people displaced by conflict.

However, that prediction has yet to bear out, with other parts of the world emerging as the epicentres of the pandemic. The WHO said there was currently no indication that large numbers of severe cases and deaths were being missed in Africa's overall tally, nor has the virus caused significant infections in refugee camps.

Some have attributed the more muted outbreak to the continent's relatively young population and the fact that many countries moved quickly to establish ""point of entry"" screening measures in the wake of the Ebola epidemic in West and Central Africa.

Moeti said lower numbers of international travellers arriving to spread the virus, quick reactions by African leaders, and the weather could also have played a role in lessening the blow.

Ten countries are currently driving Africa's epidemic, accounting for 75 percent of the roughly 207,600 cases confirmed so far, Moeti said.

In South Africa, the worst-hit country on the continent with more than 58,500 infections and some 1,200 deaths, a high number of daily cases and deaths are being reported in two provinces - the more densely populated Western Cape, where Cape Town is located, and the more sparse Eastern Cape.

""Specifically in the Western Cape where we are seeing a majority of cases and deaths, the trend seem to be similar to what was happening in Europe and in the US,"" Moeti said.

Shortages of test kits remain a challenge on the continent, Moeti added, and until there is an effective vaccine, Africa is likely to see a steady increase with hotspots requiring strong public health and social distancing measures.

Reporting from Abuja, Nigeria, the third worst-hit country on the continent after South Africa and Egypt, Al Jazeera's Ahmed Idris said a lagging healthcare system and fighting with armed groups in the north makes the situation particularly precarious.

""Two days ago, Nigeria recorded its highest number of infections with over 600 cases, now taking the total to more than 14,000 cases,"" he said. ""But it's difficult to know exactly how many people have the virus in this country, because the testing capacity of many hospitals and health clinics is still very low.""

""You also have issues of insurgencies in the north of the country. You have millions of people displaced by conflict, either Boko Haram, ethnic fighting, communal fighting, clashes between farmers and cattle herders in the rest of the country,"" he said.

In Dakar, Senegal, which has confirmed over 4,700 cases and 55 deaths, Al Jazeera's Nicolas Haque added that fears have grown as the government moves to reopen the country.

""There's real concern that the worst is yet to come because the government has decided to ease restrictions allowing people to mingle with one another,"" he said."

The Dark Overlord's actions of hacking and leaking information also imply attempts to mislead and keep information hidden.,"Notorious hacking group The Dark Overlord is threatening to leak what it claims are highly-sensitive documents relating to the 2001 September 11 attacks. It says it will publish the material capitalizing on various conspiracy theories around the 9/11 attacks unless its ransom demands are met.

According to Motherboard, the group is claiming to have breached several insurers and legal firms, including Hiscox Syndicates Ltd, Lloyds of London and Silverstein Properties.

The Dark Overlord says in an announcement published on PasteBin: “When major incidents like the WTC 911 incident happen, part of the litigation must involve SSI (Sensitive Security Information) and SCI (Special Compartment Information) [sic] from the likes of the FBI, CIA, TSA, FAA, DOD, and others being introduced into evidence.

“But of course this can't become public, for fear of compromising a nation's security, so they temporarily release these materials to the solicitor firms involved in the litigation with the strict demand they're destroyed after their use and that they remain highly protected and confidential to only be used behind closed doors.”

“However, humans aren't perfect and many of these documents don't become destroyed, and when thedarkoverlord comes along hacking all these solicitor firms, investment banks, and global insurers, we stumble upon the juiciest secrets a government has to offer.”

The group says it will be leaking “the first few documents as proof of our trove on the famous dark web hacker forum KickAss” and invited terrorist groups and nations such as China and Russia to make a purchase.

Who is the Dark Overlord and what are its tactics?

In the beginning, the hacker group stole data which it offered for sale, but its attacks soon turned to extortion. Then the Dark Overlord made a habit of hacking high profile organisations and demanding cash in exchange for not leaking information into the public domain. As appears to be the case in this latest “announcement”, the group tends to leak snippets to the media to pressure the victim to pay up.

Previously, the group has targeted health institutions, schools and media production companies including a London-based plastic surgery clinic and a Hollywood production studio – and the group also leaked an entire season of Netflix’s Orange Is The New Black.

Another attempted extortion was LA-based investment bank WestPark Capital. When this was unsuccessful the group leaked information including non-disclosure agreements, reports and contracts. This data was confirmed as legitimate.

According to the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), any organization that deals with sensitive personal information – such as medical institutions and law firms – is at a higher risk of being targeted by The Dark Overlord. It says such an organization “owes a particular duty of care to its clients because of the risk of severe emotional distress if client data is made public”.

However, it points out that while evidence of the stolen data is often provided by this group, “the volume and sensitivity of the data may be exaggerated to maximise impact”.

It is therefore probable that the volume and sensitivity of the data stolen in this latest hack has been exaggerated. The objective of the PasteBin post, as is typical of this group, is extortion. The Dark Overlord is encouraging “dozens of solicitor firms” and others to contact its e-mail and request documents and materials are withdrawn from public release. “However, you'll be paying us,” the post says.

Experts agree the material the Dark Overlord claims to have is not as game-changing as it seems. Ian Thornton-Trump, head of cyber security at Amtrust International says this latest incident sounds like “cyber-criminal bravado”.

“The fact that the firms are named makes me want to believe they have refused to pay the ransoms, so this is a pressure tactic by The Dark Overlord to force the ransom issue.”

Thornton-Trump also questions whether the group has oversold the ""sensitive nature"" of the documents, saying: “So many years later after the events of 9/11, the items in question may have their security clearance expire in the next six years anyway. A lot of it has been already disclosed by journalists and authors.”

He adds: “This really underscores the importance of security controls. Ultimately this a great example of a threat actor for blue teams to learn from and red teams to emulate.”

At the same time, says Jake Moore, cyber security expert at ESET UK: “The problem with digital ransom is that it’s virtually impossible for the payee to know if the ransom call has any substance – unless of course you know you have been breached or are concerned about the level of security protecting your most delicate assets.”

He advises firms to never pay the ransom. “They may or may not hand over the goods, they may or may not have a copy and indeed could have already sold it or given it away. Meanwhile, because of the nature of digital theft, they may not even be the original owner of the stolen data.”"

The 10 alleged deep-cover operatives who were arrested on Monday may number more spies than were here in the 1950s, when there was a real possibility of war between the U.S. and Russia. (An 11th suspect was apprehended in Cyprus but released on bail.) You have to wonder what the Russians could have been thinking to spend the tens of millions of dollars that such an espionage infrastructure costs. Were they planning for a new Cold War?

The other odd thing is that the suspected Russian operatives seem to have been stuck with a Cold War spy's craft, with secret writing, dead drops and money stashes. What was wrong with flying to Europe to meet your control officer once a month? On top of that, there was a comic sloppiness to the whole operation. At one point, an undercover FBI agent introduced himself to one of the suspects, claiming to be a substitute-control officer. Not only did the alleged Russian operative fall for it, she didn't notice that afterward, she was followed by more undercover FBI agents to a Verizon store, where they observed her buying a prepaid phone card. They then observed her as she apparently dropped the Verizon bag into a trash can  with the receipt in it. The name on it was Irene Kutsov  not the Americanized alias she reportedly used in the U.S.  and the address ""99 Fake Street."" Indeed, the suspects were not charged with espionage but, much less glamorously, conspiring to act as unauthorized foreign agents and conspiring to commit money laundering. Moscow has called the accusations baseless.

We can all laugh at this bad version of Get Smart, but the disturbing side of it is the suggestion that Russian intelligence has not grown up since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991  and that probably means neither has the Kremlin. You only have to consider the detailed ""tasking"" the Russian operatives were allegedly asked to pursue, like uncovering America's ""secret"" policy on Iran. Doesn't the Kremlin understand that even with the Obama Administration, you can figure that out from the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal or conferences sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute? Or take the tasking on the CIA's leadership. Wouldn't it have been a lot cheaper for Moscow to open an Amazon account and start buying up memoirs written by former CIA operatives? Unlike in Russia, the CIA pretty much lets its operatives write what they want about its leadership, including the good and the bad.

What should worry us about these arrests is that Russia assumes we are still playing the Great Game in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and apparently believes there's still a global zero-sum game going on. Does Russia think that if the U.S. were to miraculously stabilize Afghanistan and install a government friendly to the West that Moscow would somehow lose?

But it's really Iran that is at play here. It's unfortunate that Russia does not understand that we absolutely need Moscow as a full-fledged ally to contain that country. If Russia, still acting as if we're in the Cold War, thinks it can turn Iran into a permanent thorn in our side in the Middle East, that very well could lead to a catastrophe we would both suffer from. Let's just hope it is only Russian intelligence that's out of tune with the times, and not the Kremlin.

If I were President Obama, I would quickly release the suspected operatives, send them back to Moscow with bottles of champagne and follow that up with a visit by the Secretary of State to ask what it is the Kremlin doesn't know about the U.S. that it wants to know.

McConnell made the commitment after meeting Tuesday with a group of first responders.

""We want to try to deal with (the legislation) before the August recess,"" the Kentucky Republican told ABC News, adding that he had a ""good meeting"" with the first responders and even received the shield of a retired New York City detective who now is suffering from cancer after working for weeks at the World Trade Center site.

The meeting came two weeks after comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, offered withering criticism of Congress at a public hearing at the Capitol that was attended by uniformed firefighters and police officers but few lawmakers.

McConnell now has ""a sense of urgency"" about the bill and wants to see it approved before Congress goes on its August recess, said John Feal, a recovery worker at the World Trade Center site and a longtime activist.

Approving the bill in the House and Senate by August would be ""way ahead of schedule"" and a credit to McConnell and advocates such as comedian Jon Stewart, Feal said.

Stewart has criticized McConnell and other congressional leaders for failing to ensure that the victims' fund, set up after the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, is replenished.

The $7 billion fund is being depleted and has cut benefit payments by up to 70 percent. A bill pending in Congress would ensure the fund can pay benefits for 70 years.

Stewart, the former host of ""The Daily Show,"" mocked McConnell on Stephen Colbert's late-night talk show last week, accusing the GOP leader of slow walking the legislation and using it as a political pawn to get other things done.

McConnell said last week that the issue will be addressed and that he does not know why Stewart was "" all bent out of shape.""

Feal called Tuesday's meeting with McConnell ""one of the best meetings"" he's had at the Capitol in more than 15 years of advocacy on the issue.

He and other first responders were ""ready to shake hands"" on a deal or ""ready to get into a street fight,"" Feal said, adding that in the end, no drama was needed.

The Senate leader said last week that Congress has always acted in a compassionate way on the 9/11 fund, a statement Feal strongly disputed. The fund has always had a five-year sunset provision, among other problems, Feal said.

Feal told reporters that he gave McConnell ""my version of what compassion is ... and I think we left the meeting now knowing what our compassion is, and he has to match that. And I think he will.""

Feal, who lost part of his left foot in an accident during recovery work after the attacks, credited Stewart with raising the profile of first responders still suffering from respiratory ailments and other illnesses related to the attacks.

Stewart ""put our 18 years of pain and suffering"" in public view at a House hearing June 11, Feal said. First responders shared similar stories with McConnell at Tuesday's meeting, he said.

The bill to replenish the fund must pass the House first. Majority Democrats have promised a vote before their August recess."

The 1986 nuclear disaster, recently brought back into the public eye by the hugely popular TV show of the same name, caused thousands of cancers, turned a once populous area into a ghost city, and resulted in the setting up of an exclusion zone 2600km² in size.

But Chernobyl’s exclusion zone isn’t devoid of life. Wolves, boars and bears have returned to the lush forests surrounding the old nuclear plant. And when it comes to vegetation, all but the most vulnerable and exposed plant life never died in the first place, and even in the most radioactive areas of the zone, vegetation was recovering within three years.

Humans and other mammals and birds would have been killed many times over by the radiation that plants in the most contaminated areas received. So why is plant life so resilient to radiation and nuclear disaster?

To answer this question, we first need to understand how radiation from nuclear reactors affects living cells. Chernobyl’s radioactive material is “unstable” because it is constantly firing out high energy particles and waves that smash cellular structures or produce reactive chemicals which attack the cells’ machinery.

Most parts of the cell are replaceable if damaged, but DNA is a crucial exception. At higher radiation doses, DNA becomes garbled and cells die quickly. Lower doses can cause subtler damage in the form of mutations altering the way that the cell functions – for example, causing it to become cancerous, multiply uncontrollably, and spread to other parts of the body.

In animals this is often fatal, because their cells and systems are highly specialised and inflexible. Think of animal biology as an intricate machine in which each cell and organ has a place and purpose, and all parts must work and cooperate for the individual to survive. A human cannot manage without a brain, heart or lungs.

Plants, however, develop in a much more flexible and organic way. Because they can’t move, they have no choice but to adapt to the circumstances in which they find themselves. Rather than having a defined structure as an animal does, plants make it up as they go along. Whether they grow deeper roots or a taller stem depends on the balance of chemical signals from other parts of the plant and the “wood wide web”, as well as light, temperature, water and nutrient conditions.

Critically, unlike animal cells, almost all plant cells are able to create new cells of whatever type the plant needs. This is why a gardener can grow new plants from cuttings, with roots sprouting from what was once a stem or leaf.

All of this means that plants can replace dead cells or tissues much more easily than animals, whether the damage is due to being attacked by an animal or to radiation.

And while radiation and other types of DNA damage can cause tumours in plants, mutated cells are generally not able to spread from one part of the plant to another as cancers do, thanks to the rigid, interconnecting walls surrounding plant cells. Nor are such tumours fatal in the vast majority of cases, because the plant can find ways to work around the malfunctioning tissue.

Interestingly, in addition to this innate resilience to radiation, some plants in the Chernobyl exclusion zone seem to be using extra mechanisms to protect their DNA, changing its chemistry to make it more resistant to damage, and turning on systems to repair it if this doesn’t work. Levels of natural radiation on the Earth’s surface were much higher in the distant past when early plants were evolving, so plants in the exclusion zone may be drawing upon adaptations dating back to this time in order to survive.

Life is now thriving around Chernobyl. Populations of many plant and animal species are actually greater than they were before the disaster.

Given the tragic loss and shortening of human lives associated with Chernobyl, this resurgence of nature may surprise you. Radiation does have demonstrably harmful effects on plant life, and may shorten the lives of individual plants and animals. But if life-sustaining resources are in abundant enough supply and burdens are not fatal, then life will flourish.

Crucially, the burden brought by radiation at Chernobyl is less severe than the benefits reaped from humans leaving the area. Now essentially one of Europe’s largest nature preserves, the ecosystem supports more life than before, even if each individual cycle of that life lasts a little less.

In a way, the Chernobyl disaster reveals the true extent of our environmental impact on the planet. Harmful as it was, the nuclear accident was far less destructive to the local ecosystem than we were. In driving ourselves away from the area, we have created space for nature to return."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). HPV is the virus that causes genital warts.

Besides genital warts, an HPV infection can cause these other problems:
• In females, it can cause problems with the that may lead to cervical cancer. HPV infection also can lead to cancer in the vagina, vulva, anus, mouth, and throat.
• In males, HPV infection may lead to cancer in the penis, anus, mouth, and throat.
• New research suggests that HPV may be linked to heart disease in women.

Both girls and guys can get HPV from sexual contact, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Most people infected with HPV don't know they have it because they don't notice any signs or problems. People do not always get genital warts, but the virus is still in their system and could cause damage. This means that people with HPV can pass the infection to others without knowing it.

Because HPV can cause problems like genital warts and some kinds of cancer, a vaccine is an important step in preventing infection and protecting against the spread of HPV.

That's why doctors recommend that all girls and guys get the vaccine from age 11 or 12 through age 26. If needed, kids can get the vaccine starting at age 9.

How Does the HPV Vaccine Work?

The HPV vaccine is recommended for people 9 to 26 years old:
• For kids and teens ages 9–14, the vaccine is given in 2 shots over a 6- to 12-month period.
• For teens and young adults (ages 15–26), it's given in 3 shots over a 6-month period.

It works best when people get all their shots on time. If you're under age 26 and you've missed a shot, you can still catch up. Just ask your doctor about the best way to do that.

The vaccine does not protect people against strains of HPV that might have infected them before getting the vaccine. The most effective way to prevent HPV infection is to get vaccinated before having sex for the first time. But even if you have had sex, don't give up on getting the vaccine. It's still the best way to protect against strains of the virus that you may not have come in contact with.

The vaccine doesn't protect against all types of HPV. Anyone having sex should get routine checkups at a doctor's office or health clinic. Girls should get Pap smears when a doctor recommends it — usually around age 21 unless there are signs of a problem before that.

The HPV vaccine is not a replacement for using condoms to protect against other strains of HPV — and other STDs — when having sex.

What Are the Side Effects of the HPV Vaccine?

Side effects that people get from the HPV vaccine usually are minor. They may include swelling or pain at the injection site, or feeling faint after getting the vaccine. As with other vaccines, there is a small chance of an allergic reaction.

A few people have reported health problems after getting the shot. The FDA is monitoring the vaccine closely to make sure these are not caused by the vaccine itself.

Most people have no trouble with the vaccine. You can make fainting less likely by sitting down for 15 minutes after each shot.

How Can I Protect Myself From HPV?

For people who have sex, condoms offer some protection against HPV. Condoms can't completely prevent infections because hard-to-see warts can be outside the area covered by a condom, and the virus can infect people even when a partner doesn't have warts. Also, condoms can break.

The only way to be completely sure about preventing HPV infections and other STDs is not to have sex (abstinence). Spermicidal foams, creams, and jellies aren't proven to protect against HPV or genital warts.

If you have questions about the vaccine or are worried about STDs, talk to your doctor."

The Global Wealth report from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said the number of millionaires in the world grew to 17 million in 2014, up from 15 million in 2013. The world's millionaires now control 41 percent of the $164 trillion in global private wealth, up from 40 percent in 2013. The report said millionaires are expected to control 46 percent of the world's wealth in 2019.

The growing fortunes of the wealthy are owed largely to rising stock markets and asset prices around the world. According to BCG, 73 percent of the gains in global private wealth last year came from market performance on existing assets rather than newly created wealth or businesses.

 ""The wealthier are getting more and more wealthy,"" said Anna Zakrzewski, a BCG partner and managing director. ""They have a much larger share of their wealth invested in equity markets and last year was a good year for market performance."" By far, the U.S. still has the largest number of millionaires. That segment of the population grew by 4.7 percent last year to 6.9 million. (BCG defines millionaires as households with $1 million in easily monetized wealth—cash, stock and securities, pension funds and other financial assets. Their wealth measurement doesn't include real estate, business ownership and collectible and consumer goods).

China ranked second in millionaire population but had the largest number of new millionaires in 2014. Its millionaire population grew to 3.6 million from 2.4 million in 2014, meaning the world's second largest economy added more than half of the world's 2 million new millionaires last year.

Ranking third was Japan, with 1.1 million millionaires, up 4.7 percent from 2013. Switzerland had the highest concentration of millionaires, or millionaires per capita. Fully 13.5 percent of Switzerland's population are millionaires. Bahrain ranked second, with 12.3 percent, followed by Qatar with 11.6 percent. The report also highlighted a growing divide between the rich and the super rich, as billionaires and those with hundreds of millions of dollars enjoy stronger wealth gains than mere millionaires. The number of ultra-high-net-worth households—which is defined as $100 million and up—is expected to grow by 19 percent globally and 12 percent in North America by 2019. 

 In contrast, the number of ""lower high-net worth"" households, or those with $1 million to $20 million, is expected to grow by only 6.9 percent."

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia voters will make their picks Tuesday in primary contests that could help decide the balance of power in the General Assembly.

Both parties have some highly contested races. Virginia is one of only four states with legislative elections this year, and the only one where there’s a chance of Democrats flipping control of the legislature. Republicans currently have narrow majorities in both the House and Senate.

Polls will be open 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Each voter will need to bring a photo ID, and declare which party’s ballot they want. Any registered voter can vote in either party’s primaries, but can’t vote in more than one.

Anyone not already registered won’t be able to vote. Virginia doesn’t allow same-day registration.

The primaries have produced highly charged battles in both parties.

An unusually high number of Democratic incumbents are being challenged by newcomers in the mold of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has emerged as a leading voice for progressive policies after her upset win in a Democratic primary in New York last year.

On the GOP side, campaigns have been fueled by lingering resentment over last year’s vote to expand Medicaid.

Challengers in both parties have accused incumbents of selling out while serving in Richmond. Incumbents have pointed to their mainstream appeal, saying they’re best positioned to hold onto their seats for their party in November.

Virginia’s 2017 elections provided an early warning of the anti-Trump blue wave that swept through the 2018 U.S. midterms. Now this year’s legislative elections could signal national trends in 2020.

One of the most closely watched Democratic races involves Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw, a canny veteran of Capitol politics who is ardently pro-business and chummy with Republicans. Saslaw hasn’t faced a primary challenger in 40 years. This year he has two opponents.

One of them, human rights lawyer Yasmine Taeb, has been painted Saslaw as too cozy with special interests and too lax about ethics in Richmond.

Nicole Merlene is making similar arguments against another Northern Virginia incumbent, Sen. Barbara Favola.

Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, who leads the Senate Finance Committee, is facing challenger Tina Freitas. She has hammered Hanger for his vote to expand Medicaid. The state’s hospitals have spent heavily to help Hanger keep his seat.

And in a Richmond-area Senate seat, former Del. Joe Morrissey is trying to make a political comeback against incumbent Democratic Sen. Roslyn Dance. Morrissey is a former Virginia lawmaker who used to spend his days at the state Capitol and his nights in jail after being accused of having sex with his teenage secretary.

In northern Virginia, two prosecutors’ races have taken center stage, thanks in part to nearly $1 million from a political action committee financed by liberal billionaire George Soros on behalf of two challengers.

Parisa Dehghani-Tafti in Arlington County and Steve Descano in Fairfax County are challenging Democratic incumbents Theo Stamos and Ray Morrogh, respectively. The challengers say they want to make the criminal justice system fairer to the accused. The incumbents say they’ve implemented many reforms on their own.

Also in Fairfax County, multiple candidates are running for the Democratic nomination to lead the Board of Supervisors in the state’s most populous jurisdiction. The incumbent, Sharon Bulova, opted not to seek another term."

The pandemic has upended life around the planet as nations try to stop the spread of the disease that has so far claimed more than 190,000 lives, infected nearly three million people and hammered the global economy.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said defeating the pandemic will require the biggest health effort ever seen as the United Nations joined forces with world leaders and the private sector to develop, produce and distribute a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

""We face a global public enemy like no other,"" Guterres told a virtual briefing. ""A world free of COVID-19 requires the most massive public health effort in history.""

""None of us is safe until all of us are safe,"" the UN chief said. ""COVID-19 respects no borders. COVID-19 anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.""

While the disease appears to be peaking in Europe and the United States, other nations are still in the early stages of the fight and the WHO has warned strict measures should remain until there is a viable treatment or vaccine.

The race is on around the world to develop one, with the University of Oxford launching a human trial, while Germany announced similar trials will start by next week.

In a briefing at the White House, scientists said they had found the virus was quickly destroyed by sunlight, raising hopes that the pandemic could ease as the northern hemisphere summer approaches.

""Is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?"" Trump said. ""It sounds interesting to me.""

But his suggestion was met with disbelief by many experts who cautioned against any such experiment.

""This notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible, and it's dangerous,"" Vin Gupta, pulmonologist and health expert told NBC News.

The United States is now the worst-affected nation in the world, with about 50,000 coronavirus deaths.

In a bid to restart its economy, the US state of Georgia will lift restrictions further than most on Friday when it allows businesses like gyms and hair salons to reopen -- a move seen as too far by some.

""This is an irresponsible move that is based solely on dollars over science,"" Randy Adler, owner of Babs Midtown restaurant, told AFP. ""It is not the right thing to do.""

Across the globe more than four billion people are still under some form of lockdown or stay-at-home order even as governments begin easing restrictions, weighing the risk of more infections against growing economic fallout.

Muslims across the world began marking the holy month of Ramadan under the confinement orders on Friday, with bans on prayers in mosques and large gatherings of families and friends to break the daily fast -- a centrepiece of the holy month.

In the Saudi holy city of Mecca, the Grand Mosque, usually packed with tens of thousands of pilgrims during Ramadan, was deserted as religious authorities suspended the year-round umrah pilgrimage.

""We are used to seeing the holy mosque crowded with people during the day, night, all the time... I feel pain deep inside,"" said Ali Mulla, the muezzin who gives the call to prayer at the Grand Mosque.

But despite the coronavirus threat, clerics and conservatives in some countries including Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia -- the world's largest Muslim-majority nation -- have pushed back against social distancing rules, refusing to stop gatherings in mosques.

Several thousand people attended evening prayers on Thursday at the biggest mosque in the capital of Indonesia's conservative Aceh province, and there were similar scenes at many sites in Pakistan.

The WHO called for a stop to some Ramadan activities to lower the risk of infections, and authorities in several countries have explicitly warned of the threat from large religious gatherings.

Distancing measures and the severe economic impact of the pandemic have also meant many charitable activities during Ramadan, especially food distribution and other donations, have been hit hard.

The economic devastation wreaked by lockdowns indoors is huge, with the world facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression.

US lawmakers covered their faces with masks and voted in small groups to approve a $483 billion stimulus plan, on top of a $2.2 trillion package already enacted.

The money will back small businesses on the brink of bankruptcy and hard-pressed hospitals as the world's biggest economy reels, with more than 26 million people losing their jobs since the pandemic hit.

In Europe -- the hardest-hit continent -- leaders haggled by video conference over their own package that could top one trillion euros, as the European Central Bank chief warned of the risk of ""acting too little, too late"".

The 27-nation European Union agreed to ask the bloc's executive arm to come up with a rescue plan by May 6, sources told AFP.

The crucial economic discussions come as parts of Europe slowly loosen restrictions after progress on reducing the number of new infections.

But experts have warned of a possible second wave, and authorities are ramping up their capacity to deal with it in Germany -- where curbs on public life have been eased recently.

The German Football League says it is ready for the Bundesliga to resume from May 9, though without fans in stadiums and with strict player hygiene measures. A final government decision is expected next week."

They caution, however, that the concentrations of particles in the lower atmosphere are small and do not threaten human health.

Between 1945 and 1998, nations around the world tested nuclear weapons underground, underwater and high in the atmosphere. The atmospheric tests, conducted in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s—along with the burn-up of a plutonium-powered SNAP-9A satellite in 1964—created radioactive debris that became attached to particles in the air, called aerosols. In the troposphere—the lowest part of the atmosphere extending from the ground to about 17 to 20 kilometers up—these particles washed out within weeks to months. But a combination of factors, such as the barrier-like tropopause, keep the particles in the stratosphere (the next layer up, extending to about 50 kilometers) for longer. But how long?

Studies done in the 1960s and 1970s, in which aerosols were sampled with aircraft and balloons, showed that most radioactive particles lingered in the stratosphere for about one to four years. Larger particles, those in the range of one to 10 micrometers settled even faster, last only weeks to months in the stratosphere. (The particles didn't just disappear; they moved down into the troposphere during interruptions in the tropopause that allow mixing between the troposphere and stratosphere, events that happen most often in spring.) Because nuclear tests were conducted so long ago, all these radioactive stratospheric particles should mostly be gone by now, scientists had concluded.

The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull started scientists to think that those conclusions might be wrong. When the volcano erupted, researchers in Switzerland began taking aerosol samples from the troposphere, and they found elevated concentrations of radioactive particles. Levels of plutonium and cesium (another byproduct of nuclear testing) were up to three orders of magnitude higher than levels found in aerosols at ground level. These measurements contradicted the earlier aerosol studies, which had found low levels throughout the troposphere; something was up.

José Corcho Alvarado of Lausanne University Hospital and colleagues gathered aerosol data that had been collected by military aircraft over Switzerland for most years starting in the 1970s until 2004 along with similar data collected as the ash plume from Eyjafjallajökull traveled over the country in 2010. They then used this data to create a model of the distribution of radioactive particles in the atmosphere over Switzerland from 1970 to the present.

The majority of the plutonium in the stratosphere, they calculated based on concentrations and decay rates, must have been deposited there between 1964 and 1982. That’s consistent with the assumption that nuclear testing and the satellite breakup are the biggest sources of radioactive particles in the atmosphere. The plutonium remains in the stratosphere for an average of 2.5 to 5 years, their model revealed, but a small amount remains circulating in the stratosphere.

“Our results show that significant fractions of radioactive aerosols…remain in the stratosphere for timescales of the order of several decades,” the researchers write.

As for how the radioactive plutonium likely ended up in the volcano’s ash plume, here’s what the researchers propose: The eruption caused thousands of tons of molten rock to come into contact with ice. That interaction created a huge explosion that threw steam and particles into the air, pushing fine-grained ash and gases such as sulfur dioxide into the lower regions of the stratosphere. The ash and sulfur particles picked up plutonium and cesium from the stratosphere and brought the radioactive elements down into the troposphere.

“The strong volcanic eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano has redistributed anthropogenic radionuclides [radioactive particles from human activities] in the lower atmosphere,” the researchers write.

It’s not enough radioactivity for people to worry about—someone born after the tests were done isn’t going to get cancer from plutonium particles in the stratosphere. But it may be enough to help scientists who study the movement of particles through the atmosphere because the radioactive particles act like markers of how air circulates."

Allen Ginsberg, beat poet and icon of the counterculture, and Richard Helms, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 1966-1973, during the most controversial years of the Vietnam War. But in March 1971, in a drawing room of the Corcoran Gallery in Washington DC, the two came face to face in a fittingly bizarre encounter.

Ginsberg, due to give a reading at the gallery that evening, approached Helms with a wager. He told Helms that he suspected the CIA of being involved in the illegal opium trade in South-East Asia. If he was right about this controversial allegation, Ginsberg proposed that Helms should agree to meditate for one hour every day for the rest of his life. “It is terribly important to get him into an improved mind-consciousness,” Ginsberg later told reporters.

But if Ginsberg was wrong, and Helms could demonstrate the innocence of his agency, then Ginsberg agreed to gift Helms his Vajra, a brass Buddhist-Hindu ritual instrument that symbolised “the lightning doctrine of sudden illumination”. Confident that, on this score at least, the CIA had nothing to hide, Helms agreed to the bargain.

A year later, Ginsberg sent Helms a clipping from the Far Eastern Review that reported a number of sightings by journalists of piles of raw opium being readied for sale in full view of CIA agents. A January 1972 exposé in Ramparts Magazine, which five years earlier had first exposed details of the CIA’s infiltration of the National Students’ Association, lent further credence to Ginsberg’s charges.

Accompanying the clippings, a smug Ginsberg sent Helms some notes and advice on meditation techniques, including guidance on appropriate posture and breathing:

Perhaps more troubling for Helms though, particularly at a time of mounting public suspicion of the CIA, was the publicity that Ginsberg gave to these allegations.

A few months after their encounter Ginsberg wrote an open letter to Senator Clifford P Hansen asking him to investigate the matter. Hansen refused, and instead issued a firm rebuttal in an open letter that was drafted for him by the CIA’s public affairs staff.

But Ginsberg wasn’t one to give up. The following winter, he raised the issue again, this time on television, as a guest on the Dick Cavett Show. And then in March 1972 Ginsberg published the first draft of his ever-evolving poem “CIA Dope Calypso” in an issue of Earth Magazine that contained a series of damning articles about the CIA by other authors. The poem ends:

The poem drew heavily from the analysis of Alfred W McCoy, a graduate student at Yale who was commissioned by Harper and Row to write a study of the purported heroin epidemic in Vietnam. Ginsberg had met McCoy at a rally in New Haven to free Black Panther leader Huey P Newton. “His vision was expansive and poetic, while mine was historical and documentarian,” recalled McCoy:

McCoy’s book, based on more than 250 interviews with heroin dealers, police officials, and former French and American intelligence agents was published later that year as The Politics of Heroin in South-East Asia. Needless to say, it supported Ginsberg’s accusation that the CIA were complicit in the opium trade.

When the CIA found out about McCoy’s book after he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they took strong objection to it. Cord Meyer, the CIA’s deputy director of plans, was sent to pay a visit to Harper and Row’s offices in New York and petitioned the publisher to share the galley proofs with them prior to publication. Reluctantly, Harper and Row consented.

But the CIA’s intervention backfired. Against their objections, Harper and Row chose to publish the work in full, and sped up the production of the book by a month to cash in on the controversy. “I had hoped that my work would be interesting enough to spark a public debate,” McCoy later wrote, “now the CIA, by attempting to suppress it, has itself sparked the debate”. After it was published, Ginsberg was often seen marching at protests with a copy on his head, exclaiming “he had something on his mind”.

It was not the first time the CIA had been subjected to Ginsberg’s particular brand of activist irreverence. During the trial of the “Ann Arbor Three”, a group of White Panther activists accused of blowing up a CIA recruitment station in Michigan, Ginsberg appeared as a defence witness, proclaiming himself as the spokesperson for all young people under the age of 28 in his vociferous opposition to the CIA (a claim that was vigorously rejected by the prosecution).

But perhaps there was a grain of truth in Ginsberg’s somewhat tongue-in-cheek exaggeration. Though he certainly couldn’t claim to speak for the silent majority that swept Richard Nixon into a second term of office just a few weeks after the publication of McCoy’s book, he was undoubtedly one of the most high-profile representatives of the American counterculture and anti-war movement.

As a result, he played a small but significant role in raising the American public’s suspicions about their most secretive foreign intelligence agency at a time of immense discord and social upheaval. And, in the process, he helped to cement the CIA’s place in American culture as a lightning rod for wider public anxieties regarding secrecy and the excesses of US foreign policy."

The report is a result of a 10-month joint investigation by House and Senate intelligence committees. The report is completed in December 2002, but not published until July 2003 because of declassification.

The report is more than 800 pages, and there is a 20-page errata to the report available, which shows corrections made to the original. Twenty-eight pages that allegedly deal with Saudi Arabia's connections to the 19 hijackers remained classified until July 15, 2016.

According to the report, ""various threads and pieces of information"" had either been overlooked or not put together.

""No one will ever know what might have happened had more connections been drawn between these disparate pieces of information,"" the report states. ""The important point is that the intelligence community, for a variety of reasons, did not bring together and fully appreciate a range of information that could have greatly enhanced its chances of uncovering and preventing bin Laden's plan to attack the United States on September 11, 2001.""

The report is the product of 5,000 interviews and a review of nearly one million documents.

The report includes some 19 recommendations to bolster counterterrorism efforts; those recommendations are originally released in 2002.

Finding 2: ""During the spring and summer of 2001, the Intelligence Community experienced a significant increase in information indicating that bin Laden and al-Qaeda intended to strike against US interests in the very near future.""

Finding 3: ""Beginning in 1998 and continuing into the summer of 2001, the Intelligence Community received a modest, but relatively steady, stream of intelligence reporting that indicated the possibility of terrorist attacks within the United States. Nonetheless, testimony and interviews confirm that it was the general view of the Intelligence Community, in the spring and summer of 2001, that the threatened bin Laden attacks would most likely occur against US interests overseas, despite indications of plans and intentions to attack in the domestic United States.""

Finding 4: ""From at least 1994, and continuing into the summer of 2001, the Intelligence Community received information indicating that terrorists were contemplating, among other means of attack, the use of aircraft as weapons. This information did not stimulate any specific Intelligence Community assessment of, or collective US Government reaction to, this form of threat.""

Finding 5: ""Although relevant information that is significant in retrospect regarding the attacks was available to the Intelligence Community prior to September 11, 2001, the Community too often failed to focus on that information and consider and appreciate its collective significance in terms of a probable terrorist attack. Neither did the Intelligence Community demonstrate sufficient initiative in coming to grips with the new transnational threats. Some significant piece of information in the vast stream of data being collected were overlooked, some were not recognized as potentially significant at the time and therefore not disseminated, and some required additional action on the part of foreign governments before a direct connection to the hijackers could have been established. For all those reasons, the Intelligence Community failed to fully capitalize on available and potentially important information.""



""While in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government.

Executive vice president Wayne LaPierre called for more guns, remarking, “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” and then went after the gaming industry.

“And here’s another dirty little truth that the media try their best to conceal: There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows violence against its own people, through vicious, violent video games with names like Bulletstorm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat and Splatterhouse,” he said. “And here’s one: It’s called Kindergarten Killers. It’s been online for 10 years. How come my research department could find it and all of yours either couldn’t or didn’t want anyone to know you had found it?”

LaPierre also turned his attention to film industry. “Then there’s the blood-soaked slasher films like American Psycho and Natural Born Killers that are aired like propaganda loops on Splatterdays and every day a thousand music videos that portray life as a joke and murder as a way of life. And then they have the nerve to call it entertainment,” he said. “But is that what it really is? Isn’t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? In a race to the bottom, media conglomerates compete with one another to shock, violate and offend every standard of civilized society by bringing an ever-more-toxic mix of reckless behavior and criminal cruelty into our homes — every minute of every day of every month of every year.”

Chris Dodd, head of the Motion Picture Association of America, issued a statement in response. “I have reached out to the administration to express our support for the president’s efforts in the wake of the Newtown tragedy,” he said. “Those of us in the motion picture and television industry want to do our part to help America heal. We stand ready to be part of the national conversation.”"

The cloudbuster was intended to be used in a way similar to a lightning rod: focusing it on a location in the sky and grounding it in some material that was presumed to absorb orgone—such as a body of water—would draw the orgone energy out of the atmosphere, causing the formation of clouds and rain. Reich conducted dozens of experiments with the cloudbuster, calling the research ""Cosmic orgone engineering"".[1]

A cloudbuster consists of an array of parallel hollow metal tubes which are connected at the rear to a series of flexible metal hoses which are equal or slightly smaller in diameter to the parallel tubes. Alternatively, the rear of the tubes are joined together to a single large diameter pipe and flexible metal hose. The open end of these hoses are placed in water, which Reich believed to be a natural orgone absorber. The pipes can be aimed into areas of the sky to draw energy to the ground like a lightning rod... The remains of one of Reich's cloudbusters can be found in Rangeley, Maine.[1]

Wilhelm Reich's cloudbuster was the inspiration for the 1985 song ""Cloudbusting"" by British singer Kate Bush.[2] The song describes Reich's arrest and incarceration through the eyes of his son, Peter, who later wrote the memoir A Book of Dreams (1973). A cloudbuster, bearing only a superficial resemblance to the genuine article, was designed and built for the video. The video, intended by Bush to be a short narrative film rather than a traditional music video, was conceived by Terry Gilliam and Kate Bush, and directed by Julian Doyle.[3] The video stars actor Donald Sutherland as Reich and Bush as his son, Peter.

Some chemtrail conspiracy theory believers have built cloudbusters filled with crystals and metal filings, which are pointed at the sky in an attempt to clear it of chemtrails.[4]"

And here is the upshot: Failure to stem America's decades-old rise of external deficits has led to a systematic borrowing of world savings to make ends meet. As a result, the country's net foreign debt position at the end of the second quarter of this year reached a record-high $8.6 trillion, marking an astounding $891 billion increase in net international liabilities from the previous three-month period.

That is the picture of a structurally unbalanced and a very vulnerable U.S. economy facing an unsettled political situation at home and growing security challenges abroad.

Predictably perhaps, foreign creditors are responding with a declining interest in American public debt instruments. During the 12 months to last October, non-resident holdings of U.S. Treasury securities fell by $124.5 billion.

Over that period, China and Japan, the largest investors in U.S. government bonds, trimmed their portfolios by a combined total of $128.8 billion, while running a $400.5 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in the first 10 months of this year.

A very intriguing gesture indeed: China and Japan not only declined to recycle back to the U.S. some of the dollar income from their large trade surpluses, but they also continued to actively sell their Treasury holdings.

There is a twofold message there. First, those sales could be seen as hedges against America's widely expected interest rate increases. Second, one can also see there a political subtext without falling into an exaggerated reading of unfriendly behavior.

Japan has been increasingly concerned about the forthcoming trade negotiations with the U.S., and could have been venting some of its displeasure by selling Treasury securities while pocketing a $56 billion surplus on its American goods trades.

China is a more complex case because Beijing's difficult trade negotiations with Washington are bound up with hostilities concerning China's maritime borders, arms sales to Taiwan, relations with Tibet and divergent views about peace and nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula."

The European Central Bank just announced it will be expanding its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion and kept interest rates unchanged. This is €100 billion more than investors were expecting. The duration of PEPP has also been extended to at least the end of June 2021 and purchases will continue ""until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over."" The central bank has ramped up its other bond-buying programs and usual lending to banks by €630 billion since March, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics﻿﻿.

The European Central Bank also said headline inflation was expected to be 0.3% in 2020 and 0.8% in 2021 — well below the bank’s mandate to drive inflation “close but below 2%”. GDP is expected to decline by 8.7% this year, before rebounding to 5.2% growth in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022. ECB President Lagarde last week ruled out the ""mild"" scenario (5% GDP decline) for 2020 and said we're likely to see output reduce according to the ""medium"" or ""severe"" scenarios (8-12% decline).

The pandemic poses a unique threat to the European Union and the Eurozone. A recovery fund proposed by the executive branch of the EU is being opposed by certain less-affected, ""frugal"" countries that don't want to share debt or give grants to the needy ones instead of loans. The ECB's bond-buying program faced flak from Germany's highest court last month. It demanded that the German government and central bank force the ECB to prove it is necessary and does not violate the principle of proportionality (weighing the costs and benefits). While it has no jurisdiction over the ECB, the court can affect the Bundesbank's participation. It can also inspire other nation's judiciaries in the euro area to question the ECB's credibility in a similar way.

Brexit trade talks aren't going so well. The two regions have until the end of the year to strike a new deal, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to extend the deadline. According to Germany’s ambassador to the EU, Michael Clauss, negotiators have made ""no real progress."" ""Is a deal possible? Yes, definitely,"" he said at a European Policy Centre event yesterday. ""But I think it also means that the U.K. needs to have a more realistic approach. To put it short: I think we cannot have full sovereignty and at the same time full access to the internal market. So this Brexit issue is going to absorb a lot of political or most of the political attention we expect in September and October.""

The fake war in Albania was meant to not only distract the public but to not let a sex scandal influence the presidential election that was quickly approaching. Creating a war united the American public and boosted patriotism among Americans. Although it was ethically wrong to fabricate a war as a distraction, the reason was that it would be better for the American public.

Having the ability to create a fake war opens up many dangerous doors. Ethically, it is wrong to lie to millions of people about what is going on in the world. The media is what influences and shapes public opinion. Therefore, by feeding fake stories to the public, you are altering their opinions. The public deserves to know the truth about what is going on the world so their opinions can influence a decision that is best for them. The possibility of fabricating news will change history and soon it will be unclear what is true and what is not.

Members have the media have historically attempted to deceive the public for a number of different reasons. Janet Cooke fabricated a story called “Jimmy’s World” where she made up an 8-year-old heroin addict. This and many cases in which reporters lied about their sources and stories have made the media increasingly unreliable to the public. If reporters continue to fabricate stories, lie about sources, and alter public opinion then the media will become completely unreliable.

I think the situation should have been handled very differently. A scandal as minor as the sex scandal the president was involved with should have been transparent. If the public saw that the president was attempting to be honest and publicly apologized, the scandal would have soon blown over. If it ever got out that the White House fabricated an entire story just as a distraction, the repercussions would have been much worse than if the president would have just apologized.

This issue impacts the very existence of journalism. If the media is not being truthful to the best of their ability, then there is no use for it. But if the media is fabricating stories in order to distract the public, then that is not only altering public opinion but altering history."

Syria specialist Fabrice Balanche looks at the implications of the fall of the opposition stronghold.

On Thursday March 1 the opposition stronghold of Baba Amr in Homs fell to the regime after weeks of intense bombardment, a sure sign that the Syrian regime is not faltering in the face of a year-old uprising. Fabrice Balanche, a Syria expert at Lyon University, answers FRANCE 24’s questions.

FRANCE 24: How significant is the Syrian regime’s recapture of Baba Amr in Homs?

Fabrice Balanche: The inevitable recapture of Baba Amr is a turning point in Syria’s year-old uprising. The regime has demonstrated that it is perfectly capable of retaking a zone that had been beyond its authority for a number of months. Indeed Baba Amr’s fall proves that any rebel enclave can be crushed if it does not have international military support.

Even if the Free Syrian Army (FSA) claims to have made a “tactical withdrawal”, its defeat in Baba Amr may force it to change tactics and to seek heavy weapons.

F24: What effect will the fall of Baba Amr have on the opposition movement?

F.B.: It may well discourage the population from continuing protests. Civilians have seen that if they harbour opposition fighters they will pay the price by losing their lives or their property.

Nevertheless, opposition continues in other areas of Syria and more protests may well flare up in other cities.

We must bear in mind, however, that many Syrians want a return to calm despite their desire to see regime change. People do not want to see their country descend into civil or sectarian war. They saw what happened in Homs and they do not want the same thing to happen to their towns and cities.

Moreover, the number of people openly protesting has decreased considerably since last summer, when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators turned out on the streets of Homs and Hama. There have been no significant protests in Aleppo or Damascus, Syria’s two biggest cities, which remain firmly under regime control.

F24: How do you explain President Bashar al-Assad’s resilience in the face of a year’s protest against his regime?

F.B.: Bashar al-Assad has proved beyond doubt that he is firmly in control of his elite, his administration and the Syrian army, despite his isolation in the international community. Peaceful protest and even armed resistance have done nothing to weaken his grip on power. And so long as he enjoys the support of Russia and China, he remains in a safe place in terms of international diplomacy.

While there are divisions among Western powers and within the Syrian opposition itself, Assad’s regime is not ripe for collapse.

F24: What is likely to happen next in Syria?

F.B.: Some countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia may try to arm the FSA and provoke a civil war in the country. Such a scenario would risk fanning the flames of a conflict that could last a decade. The western nations would then be able to sit back and allow this situation to develop, while applying pressure on the regime through economic sanctions.

The other possible scenario is that the western nations will realise that the game is up and resign themselves to a gradual restoration of relations with Bashar al-Assad. Al-Assad would be obliged to start negotiating with the internal opposition, notably with the Local Coordination Committees, which have been organising opposition on the ground. But, having restored military control over the country, he would eventually regain the upper hand politically as well."

In a statement on Tuesday, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the hackers had targeted pharmaceutical companies, research organisations and local governments.
• US charges Harvard professor with allegedly lying about China ties
• US charges four Chinese military hackers in 2017 Equifax breach
• 'Evil Corp': Russian hackers indicted in the US

The NCSC and the CISA did not say which countries were responsible for the attacks. But one US official and one UK official said the warning was in response to intrusion attempts by suspected Chinese and Iranian hackers, as well as some Russian-linked activity.

The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss non-public details of the alert. Tehran, Beijing and Moscow have all repeatedly denied conducting offensive cyberoperations and say they are the victims of such attacks themselves.

State hacking groups ""frequently target organisations in order to collect bulk personal information, intellectual property and intelligence that aligns with national priorities"", the NCSC and the CISA said.

""For example, actors may seek to obtain intelligence on national and international healthcare policy or acquire sensitive data on COVID-19 related research.""

The warning follows efforts by a host of state-backed hackers to compromise governments, businesses and health agencies in search of information about the new disease and attempts to combat it.

Reuters news agency has reported in recent weeks that Vietnam-linked hackers targeted the Chinese government over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and that multiple groups, some with ties to Iran, tried to break into the World Health Organization.

The officials said the alert was not triggered by any specific incident or compromise, but rather intended as a warning - to the attackers and the targeted organisations that need to better defend themselves.

""These are organisation that wouldn't normally see themselves as nation-state targets, and they need to understand that now they are,"" said one of the officials.

The agencies said hackers had been seen trying to identify and exploit security weaknesses caused by staff working from home as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

In other incidents, the attackers repeatedly tried to compromise accounts with a series of common and frequently-used passwords - a technique known as ""password spraying"".

""It's no surprise that bad actors are doing bad things right now, in particular targeting organisations supporting COVID-19 response efforts,"" a CISA spokesman said.

""We're seeing them use a variety of tried and true techniques to gain access to accounts and compromise credentials."""

The city raised its alert level from Level 3 to Level 2 -- the highest alert being Level 1 -- the Beijing government's Deputy Secretary Chen Bei announced in a press conference Tuesday night.

The move comes as the city's latest coronavirus outbreak continued to spread Tuesday, with at least 106 new infections since Thursday following an outbreak at Xinfadi, the city's largest wholesale food market.

Officials had earlier locked down more residential compounds, ordered more than 30,000 restaurants to be disinfected and tightened outbound travel.

All residents living communities deemed medium or high risk, as well as people connected to the Xinfadi market, are banned from leaving the city.

The sprawling, bustling market in Beijing's southwestern Fengtai district occupies 277 acres and has more than 2,000 stalls, selling mainly fruit and vegetables as well as meat and seafood. It supplies about 70% of the city's vegetables and 10% of its pork, according to officials.

The market has been shut down since Saturday, but its sheer size and the amount of people who work or visit there from in and outside of Beijing have heightened the risk of the outbreak spreading.

For the rest of the city's more than 20 million residents, non-essential travel out of town is strongly discouraged, according to the government announcement. Those who must travel need to present a negative result from tests conducted within seven days of departure.

The city is reintroducing strict access rules in and out of all local residential communities, and shutting down all schools and recreational venues. Sporting events will also be canceled.

Via door-to-door visits and calls, authorities have tracked down nearly 200,000 people who had been to the market during the two weeks prior to its closure. They have been told to stay at home for medical observation and are being tested for the coronavirus, a city official told a news conference on Monday.

Two other Beijing food markets have been shut down due to confirmed cases linked to Xinfadi, leading to strict residential lockdowns in their vicinity.

On Tuesday, Xicheng district -- which neighbors Fengtai -- announced that seven residential communities around the Tiantao Honglian market will be locked down following the discovery of a coronavirus case on Sunday.

This follows similar lockdowns on residential compounds near Xinfadi and the Yuquandong market in Haidian district. In total, 29 residential communities have been locked down across the city.

The residential lockdown measures are similar to the ones imposed earlier in the city of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.

Wang Du, who lives in one of the communities under lockdown near Yuquandong market, said residents couldn't leave the compound to buy groceries, and had to order food online or buy from a truck that came to the compound once a day with potatoes, fresh vegetables and eggs.

She said all residents in her community had nucleic acid tests for the coronavirus yesterday.

""To be honest, I'm not too worried,"" she said. ""I think we have a lot of experience in containment measures, and we're able to react very swiftly (to the new outbreak).""

As of Tuesday morning, 276 agricultural produce markets and 33,173 restaurants across the city had also been disinfected, officials said.

The outbreak has also spread beyond Beijing, with the nearby provinces of Liaoning and Hubei reporting a total of eight coronavirus cases linked to the capital clusters.

On Tuesday, Sichuan province in the country's southwest also reported a confirmed case -- a woman who returned from Beijing on June 9. She was infected while visiting her husband, who worked at Xinfadi market.

Municipal authorities also banned high-risk groups, such as close contacts of confirmed cases, from leaving the city, officials said Monday."

The agency's dossier on the group's founding member, Ol' Dirty Bastard has been released in response to a Freedom of information request.

ODB, aka Russell Jones, died of an accidental drug overdose in 2004, after consuming a mixture of cocaine and opiates. 



But the rap group continues and is releasing its 6th album this year.

'The WTC is heavily involved in the sale of drugs, illegal guns, weapons possession, murder, carjacking and other types of violent crime,' according to the Gun.io blog.

Jones was arrested nine times between April 1, 1987, and Jan. 15, 1999, for a range of crimes that included petty larceny, contempt and nonsupport of a child. 



In January 1999, he was charged with attempted murder in the first/second degree, criminal use of a firearm, and unlawful wearing of a body vest, Gun.io reported.

Riddled with violent crime, the late rapper's file refers to the murder of Jerome Estrella aka Boo Boo, by an unnamed member of a gang called the Bloods, who allegedly sometimes acted as enforcers for the WTC. 



The confessed killer allegedly offered to do a deal with detectives to provide information about the WTC.

in the file, documenting the late hip hop star's forays with the law, details the arrest of P Diddy, though no actual connection between the two hip hop stars is made.

The file also describes a drug-deal gone bad that resulted in a shooting and carjacking on Staten Island.

One of those involved was allegedly a suspect in an unsolved murder supposedly ordered by the WTC in retaliation for a robbery.

Some ten pages of the folder are dedicated to a chain of events leading to the murder of a Robert Pooh Johnson in 1997.

After being shot and robbed by men wearing ski masks in his home ODB was interviewed by police. They allegedly made off with $10,000 worth of jewellery. ODB said he knew the gunman who lived down the street from him but did not want to continue with the investigation because of the possible repercussions for his family in the projects. 



The document is heavily redacted and the sequence of events is not clear, but the file claims members of the collective bought a gun used to murder former associate Johnson in 1997.

'Johnson was an associate of the WTC who had a falling out with the group and it is believed that his murder was ordered by someone within the WTC,' the file states.

The files also claim that the Wu-Tang Clan used their record label to launder money.

Once a member had shown their commitment to the WTC, they were 'offered record contracts to record rap type music,'with numerous recording companies set up for this purpose.

'This allows legitimate monies to flow into these accounts along with the proceeds from [redacted].'the files allege."

The Vaccine Court Omnibus Autism Proceeding ruled against the parents of Michelle Cedillo, Colten Snyder and William Yates Hazlehurst, who had claimed that a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had combined with other vaccine ingredients to damage the three children.

“Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment,” Special Master George Hastings, a former tax claims expert at the Department of Justice, wrote in the 183-page Cedillo ruling.

The families sought payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault system that has a $2.5 billion fund built up from a 75-cent-per-dose tax on vaccines.

Instead of judges, three “special masters” heard the three test cases representing thousands of other petitioners.

They asked whether a combination vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, plus a mercury-containing preservative called thimerosal, caused the children’s symptoms.

“The evidence does not support the general proposition that thimerosal-containing vaccines can damage infants’ immune systems,” Hastings wrote, after reviewing tens of thousands of documents and hours of oral arguments.

“I further conclude that while Michelle Cedillo has tragically suffered from autism and other severe conditions, the petitioners have also failed to demonstrate that her vaccinations played any role at all in causing those problems.”

Michelle’s parents argued that she was a normal baby until she received the vaccine.

Experts say parents often link vaccines with their children’s symptoms because they are vaccinated at an age when autism and related disorders are often first diagnosed.

“We need ongoing research into the causes of autism, but cannot let unfounded myths keep us from giving our children the proven protection they need against infectious diseases,” the American Medical Association said in response to the ruling.

The Institute of Medicine reviewed the evidence in 2001 and 2004, and determined there was no link between vaccines and autism. Many other studies have shown no link, but a small and vocal group of parents continues to press the case.

The advocacy group Autism Speaks said the ruling did not necessarily clear vaccines, or any other potential cause.

“We will continue to support authoritative research that addresses unanswered questions about whether certain subgroups of individuals with particular underlying medical or genetic conditions may be more vulnerable to adverse effects of vaccines,” the group said in a statement.

Hastings rejected this argument in his ruling.

More than 5,300 cases were filed by parents who believed vaccines may have caused autism in their children and were seeking payment under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The no-fault payout system is meant to protect vaccine makers from costly lawsuits that drove many out of the vaccine-making business.

Autism is a mysterious condition that affects as many as one in 150 U.S. children. The so-called spectrum ranges from mild Asperger’s Syndrome to severe mental retardation and social disability, and there is no cure or good treatment."

The majority of the cases are believed to be linked to Edinburgh University.

A pupil at James Gillespie's High School has also been infected.

NHS Lothian is now trying to track down anyone who has come into contact with those infected with the illness.

Clinics for anyone who needs the MMR vaccine are being set up in the city.

The outbreak comes 18 years after a fraudulent research paper claiming autism spectrum disorders were linked to the vaccine was published, leading to a decrease in uptake for the vaccine for the cohort starting university this year.

Professor Alison McCallum, at NHS Lothian, said: ""It is crucial that people have two doses of the MMR vaccine.

""Children and young people may have missed out on one or two doses when they were younger and we would urge parents to get their child or children immunised with MMR.

""We would also encourage young people who have missed out on MMR previously to get themselves immunised.""

A spokeswoman for the University of Edinburgh said: ""The university is working closely with NHS Lothian to minimise the spread.

""We are taking appropriate action, including supporting additional vaccinations on campus for those who need them.

""Students and staff who have had the MMR vaccination or who have had measles before are reminded that they are not at risk. We will continue to monitor the situation.""

Edinburgh City Council confirmed it is working alongside the health board after the case at James Gillespie's High School.

Jane Solomon, a linguist-in-residence at Dictionary, said in a recent interview that her site's choice of ""mis"" over ""dis"" was deliberate, intended to serve as a ""call to action"" to be vigilant in the battle against fake news, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers, among other conduits.



 It's the idea of intent, whether to inadvertently mislead or to do it on purpose, that the Oakland, California-based company wanted to highlight. The company decided it would go high when others have spent much of 2018 going low.



 ""The rampant spread of misinformation is really providing new challenges for navigating life in 2018,"" Solomon told The Associated Press ahead of the word of the year announcement. ""Misinformation has been around for a long time, but over the last decade or so the rise of social media has really, really changed how information is shared. We believe that understanding the concept of misinformation is vital to identifying misinformation as we encounter it in the wild, and that could ultimately help curb its impact.""



 In studying lookups on the site that trended this year, Dictionary noticed ""our relationship with truth is something that came up again and again,"" she said.



 For example, the word ""mainstream"" popped up a lot, spiking in January as the term ""mainstream media,"" or MSM, grew to gargantuan proportions, wielded as an insult by some on the political right. Other words swirling around the same problem included a lookup surge in February for ""white lie"" after Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, admitted to telling a few for President Donald Trump.



 The word ""Orwellian"" surfaced in heavy lookups in May, after a statement attributed to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders accused the Chinese government of ""Orwellian nonsense"" in trying to impose its views on American citizens and private companies when it declared that United Airlines, American Airlines and other foreign carriers should refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China in public-facing materials, such as their websites.



 Misinformation, Solomon said, ""frames what we've all been through in the last 12 months."" In that vein, the site with 90 million monthly users has busied itself adding new word entries for ""filter bubble,"" ""fake news,"" ""post-fact,"" ""post-truth"" and ""homophily,"" among others. Other word entries on the site have been freshened to reflect timely new meanings, including ""echo chamber.""



 The company's runners-up for the top honor include ""representation,"" driven by the popularity of the movies ""Black Panther"" and ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" along with wins during the U.S. midterm elections for Muslim women, Native Americans and LGBTQ candidates.



 But the rise of misinformation, Solomon said, stretches well beyond U.S. borders and Facebook's role in disseminating fake news and propaganda in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The use of Facebook and other social media to incite violence and conflict was documented around the globe in 2018, she said.



 ""Hate speech and rumors posted to Facebook facilitated violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, riots started in Sri Lanka after false news set the country's Buddhist majority against Muslims, and false rumors about child kidnappers on WhatsApp led to mob violence in India,"" Solomon said.



 Is disinformation or misinformation at play in terms of the year's most prominent conspiracy theories? Solomon noted proliferation on social media over students in the Parkland school shooting being crisis actors instead of victims of violence, and over a group of migrants from Honduras who are making their way north being funded by ""rich liberals.""



 Elsewhere in the culture, countless podcasts and videos have spread the absurd notion of a global cover-up that the Earth is flat rather than round. The idea of ""misinfodemics"" has surfaced in the last several years to identify the anti-vaccination movement and other beliefs that lead to real-world health crises, Solomon said.



 There are distinctions between misinformation and disinformation to be emphasized.



 ""Disinformation would have also been a really, really interesting word of the year this year, but our choice of misinformation was very intentional,"" she said. ""Disinformation is a word that kind of looks externally to examine the behavior of others. It's sort of like pointing at behavior and saying, 'THIS is disinformation.' With misinformation, there is still some of that pointing, but also it can look more internally to help us evaluate our own behavior, which is really, really important in the fight against misinformation. It's a word of self-reflection, and in that it can be a call to action. You can still be a good person with no nefarious agenda and still spread misinformation.""



 She pointed to ""Poe's law"" in slicing and dicing ""misinfo"" and ""disinfo."" The term, dating to 2005, has become an internet shorthand to sum up how easy it is to spread satire as truth online when an author's intent isn't clearly indicated.



 The phrase is based on a comment one Nathan Poe posted on a Christian forum during a discussion over creationism, in which he commented: ""Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is uttrerly [sic] impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone [italics used] won't mistake for the genuine article.""



 Dictionary.com chose ""complicit"" as last year's word of the year. In 2016, it was ""xenophobia."""

Mr. Denny also said that the figure of 150 used in the hearing two weeks ago had probably come from his estimate. He said that for seven years his office had processed the papers from other counties for assignment of 20 to 22 foster‐home children a year into People's Temple homes in the Ukiah area and that his estimate, which he now sees as too high, had been based on this recollection.

Mr. Denny would not say which California counties had sent the children to the homes of People's Temple members. Neither would investigators for the General Accounting Office.

“We're going through this matching exercise trying to identify foster children,” said Richard Newman, a supervisor in the G.A.O. headquarters in Washington. The work here is being done by Joe Gordon, supervisory auditor and investigator for the Congressional watchdog agency. It was Mr. Gordon who served the subpoena on the California Department of Social Services. Mr. Newman said that the state agency had insisted on having the records subpoenaed because of statutory guarantees of privacy involving welfare payments.

Two lists of names of possible Jonestown victims are available to investigators. One is that prepared by the United States State Department of bodies for which identities were established. There are about 625 names.

The other list was compiled by People's Temple members who were living in the cult's headquarters here and were not in Jonestown on the day of the mass suicide. This list is of the members who went to Jonestown; it contains about 960 names and includes the handful who were in Guyana but survived either because they hid or because they were in Georgetown that day.

Sean Ortiz, a public information officer for the California Department of Social Services, said that state files were being checked back 18 months before the date of the mass deaths. He said that 142 “matches” had been found last month between the death list and the names of persons paid under the Federal Supplemental Security Incomeprogram, which aids the blind, aged and disabled."

You might have noticed how bright green your plants look after rain. Or you may have been watering your garden this summer, over many hot days and weeks.

So, which water is best for your plants? The stuff that falls out of the sky or the water that comes out of the tap?

You might be surprised to find that rain, especially during a thunderstorm, has special qualities that can give your plants a boost.

Read more: Why does some tap water taste weird?

This summer, much of the east coast of Australia has been affected by a series of intense summer thunder storms. A rare combination of events saw thunderstorms stretch from North Queensland to Tasmania. Tropical cyclone Penny also caused very heavy rain in far north Queensland.

Although winds and hail can damage a garden, rain during thunder storms can be particularly special for plants. That’s because lightning helps add nitrogen to your garden.

Australian soils are notoriously poor in nutrients and nitrogen is no exception. Plants crave nitrogen for a range of reasons, in particular to produce chlorophyll, the green photosynthetic pigment. If plants are deficient in nitrogen, they might look yellowish. If the nitrogen levels are very low for extended periods of time plants might be stunted, get sick or die.

Nitrogen makes up about 78% of the atmosphere but plants cannot access it directly from the sky as it takes too much energy to turn it into a form they can actually use.

Instead, plants can get their nitrogen from other sources, in processes scientists broadly refer to as nitrogen fixation.

Nitrogen can come from added fertilisers, the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and organisms that can break down atmospheric nitrogen into something usable.

Plants can also get their nitrogen from high-energy processes in the atmosphere, like solar radiation and lightning, which is where summer storms come in.

The enormous heat and pressure that lightning generates provides enough energy to break down and convert atmospheric nitrogen into a number of reactive nitrogen species. When mixed with oxygen and water in the atmosphere the resulting rainfall will contain greater levels of nitrates and ammonium.

For over a billion lightning flashes around the globe each year, 2 billion kilograms of reactive nitrogen is produced.

Read more: Carbon catch-22: the pollution in our soil

The total amount of nitrogen in rainfall varies depending on where you live and the season. A coastal region that is subject to industrial activity may have greater nitrogen deposition.

Once the rain drops reach the ground they deposit ammonium and nitrates that can be used by plants, whilst bacteria and fungi in the soil can further transform the available nitrogen in a process known as nitrification.

So, if you have had wet summer thunderstorms roll over your property, not only will your plants have had a good watering, they will have had a top up of nitrogen.

How about other factors?

Comparing tap water, that is supplied as treated drinking water, with rainwater that falls outside of summer storms can be tricky. That’s because some tap water is more alkaline (a higher pH) or saltier (have a higher ionic strength) than others. Prolonged watering with water that has a higher levels of chloride (and to a lesser extent, fluoride) can also stop the plant from taking up available nitrate. Plants can also be harmed by the surprisingly high levels of sodium in some drinking water supplies.

Read more: Your drinking water could be saltier than you think (even if you live in a capital)

Processed drinking water is almost always a poor source of nitrate. There is a very good reason for this. Water authorities all seek to minimise the nitrate content of drinking water, because high concentrations can be dangerous for babies and trigger blue baby syndrome.

Most gardeners want a slightly acidic pH because it makes nutrients more available for plants and is better for overall soil health. Here, rainwater might be your friend (pH 5.6). Tap water is more alkaline (between pH 6-8.5) depending on where your drinking water is sourced. So certain tap waters can work against you and your plants.

So what kind of water should you use on your plants, if you have the choice? Here’s the order, in best to worst:

There are also other reasons why plants sometimes look greener after rain. It can also be from the rain washing dust from plants. This is quite plausible given the dust storms in recent weeks."

The CIA Office of Inspector General exists to perform an inspector general (IG) function at the Central Intelligence Agency.

The first IG was appointed in 1952.[1]

The Rockefeller Commission, Church Committee, and Pike Committee all recommended strengthening the office of OIG. Their criticisms included claims that the IG had few staff, was ignored, and was denied access to information. Their suggestions were not made into law.[1]

The IG performed an investigation during the Iran Contra scandal in 1986/1987; related to possible CIA involvement in cocaine trafficking. Congress was unsatisfied with the IG performance during this time frame. Senators of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (especially Boren, Cohen, Specter, and Glenn) wrestled with how to improve the IG while not interfering with the work of the CIA. They tried to make a bill that would satisfy various members of congress and also not get vetoed by president George Bush.[1] Senator Boren (chairman of SSCI) worked with Robert Gates who was deputy to Brent Scowcroft at the time. In 1989 a new IG law was passed with a more independent IG. The IG also would no longer be chosen by the Director of Central Intelligence but would instead be appointed by the President with 'advice and consent' of the Senate.[1]

There were several controversies surrounding the IG during the years of the Global War on Terror.

The IG released a controversial report on failures of the intelligence community before 9/11.[2]

In 2007 General Michael Hayden, head of the CIA, had attorney Robert Deitz review the work of the IG.[2]

In 2004 the CIA OIG published a report on prisoner treatment in the Global War on Terror. It was entitled ""CIA Inspector General Special Review: Counterterrorism Detention and Interrogation Activities"".[3] After a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, a less redacted version was declassified in 2009 and released to the public.

Maybe you reacted the way I did by wondering: How can this happen in the United States of America?

On Sunday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents rounded up dozens of Chaldean – many of them Christians – in raids in the metro Detroit area.

Most of those detained lived in Macomb and Oakland counties. Most had criminal records, but none were in jail, so the majority had paid for whatever offenses they had committed. Many faced a one-way trip to Iraq, a country that might have been where their parents came from, but a nation most had never seen.

Once in Iraq, none can expect anything approaching a warm, safe welcome. They can’t speak the language, in most cases, and many have no relatives waiting for them at the Baghdad airport.

All this is part of President Trump’s crackdown on anybody who even remotely resembles a Muslim whose past is not absolutely squeaky clean.

A Detroit Free Press story quoted Martin Manna, an Iraqi-American Christian advocate and president of the Chaldean Community Foundation in Sterling Heights, as calling the deportations “like a death sentence.”

Why? Christians aren’t popular in Iraq. This was not always so. In 2003, before the United States launched its war against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, 1.4 million Christians lived in relative safety in that Mideast nation.

Saddam’s vice president was Tariq Aziz. He was a Christian. For all his bloodthirstiness, Saddam apparently had no quarrel with the Christians. As long as they didn’t cause trouble, Saddam generally left them alone.

Evangelical preacher and sociologist Tony Campolo had an invitation from Tariq Aziz to come to Iraq and preach as a way to help ease tensions. This was in 2002. Campolo prepared for the trip, but the war got in the way.

At the time, Campolo feared for Iraq’s Christians because, for better or worse, Saddam kept the lid on sectarian violence in his nation. Once Saddam was gone, all hell broke loose, and Christians became targets in the ensuing civil war.

The violence decimated the Christian community. Today, Iraq has fewer than 200,000 Christians left.

If the 30 to 40 Chaldeans rounded up Sunday end up dumped off a jetliner in Baghdad, they probably don’t stand much of a chance.

All of this brings a couple of things to mind. One, these ICE roundups don’t even remotely resemble how a democracy ought to treat the people living within its borders, whether they are citizens, visitors, aliens or folks with an unclear immigration status.

Jesus tells us that, when you do whatever you do to the least of his children, you do it to him. Think about that. Seriously, if you are a believer and, even if you aren’t, think long and hard about that.

Secondly, it makes my blood boil when right-wing folks who claim to be believers whine about religious persecution in the United States because a bakery has to prepare a cake for a gay wedding. That isn’t persecution. That’s business. If you don’t want to do the business, then lock the door and go read whatever parts of the Bible fit in with your preconceived notions.

While you do, think about how those deported Chaldeans will spend their first night in Iraq.

Or maybe their last.

In his first statement since a pipe bomb was sent to his office in Manhattan — one of at least 12 that were sent in suspicious packages to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump this week — the Oscar-winning actor refocused his followers on the upcoming midterm elections on Nov. 6.

He also addressed the scare — saying, “I thank God no one’s been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us.”

The address where the package was found, 375 Greenwich St., houses De Niro’s production company Tribeca Enterprises and restaurant Tribeca Grill, CNN reported. A report about the suspicious package was called in at 5:00 a.m. local time, and authorities removed the package via the NYPD bomb truck at 6:30 a.m.

An NYPD rep told PEOPLE that the package was similar to the other suspicious packages, its return address listed as Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and six American flag stamps placed on the manilla envelope.

Similar devices have been intercepted addressed to former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the news network CNN, Democratic donor George Soros, Rep. Maxine Waters, former CIA Director John Brennan, and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.

A manhunt is underway for the sender. Packages have contained piped bombs packed with shards of glass, authorities have said. All have been disabled by police without any reported injuries.

“If you have info that could assist the #FBI’s investigation of suspicious packages, call 1-800-CALLFBI (225-5324) or use tips.fbi.gov,” the FBI tweeted on Thursday, adding a photo of one of the packages. “If you observe suspicious activity that requires an immediate response, call 911 or contact local law enforcement immediately.”

“I just want to tell you that in these times we have to unify,” he said during an opioids event at the White House. “We have to come together and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.”

“This egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans,” Trump continued. “We are extremely angry [and] upset… We will get to the bottom of it.”

But on Thursday, Trump blamed the media for the surge of potentially dangerous mailings — saying the press was at fault for creating divisions in American society.

“A very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news,” he tweeted. “It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream media must clean up its act, fast!”

In January, he labeled the president“baby-in-chief” at a gala, and in May, he told the Daily Mail that he has banned Trump from his Nobu restaurants.

In June, De Niro told high school students, “Our country is lead by a president who believes he can make up his own truth. And we have a word for that — bulls—.”

“A college education is important, but education without humanity is ignorance,” De Niro said in March at a Fulfillment Fund event. “Look at our president. He made it through [the] University of Pennsylvania, so he was exposed to a quality education, but he’s still an idiot.”"

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) ferrets over at the National Security Archive (NSA) petitioned for, and got, the CIA’s equivalent of the dog-ate-my-homework. (Technically, the NSA obtained this document under a mandatory-declassification-review request it made in 2006, which can be faster [It still took six years!] than an FOIA request if the requester has sufficient details on a specific document.)

Bottom line, from the CIA’s point of view: Saddam used to lie about possessing WMD, so we believed he still was.

Unfortunately, the U.S. went to war based largely on that false intelligence. And 4,486 U.S. troops, 318 allies and untold thousands of Iraqis died in the ensuing conflict.

While much of the CIA explanation has been redacted, these surviving passages stand out:

— When the [U.N. and International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections proved more intrusive than expected, the Iraqi leadership appears to have panicked and made a fateful decision to secretly destroy much of the remaining nondeclared items and eliminate the evidence. — Clumsy but genuine Iraqi moves toward transparency — significant alterations in their “cheat and retreat” pattern — not only went undetected but instead seemed to confirm that Iraq could and would conceal evidence of proscribed programs. — We now judge that the Iraqis feared that [Saddam’s son-in-law and Iraqi weapons expert Hussein Kamel Hassan al-Majid] — a critical figure in Iraq’s WMD and [denial and deception] activities — would reveal additional undisclosed information. Iraq decided that further widespread deception and attempts to hold onto extensive WMD programs while under U.N. sanctions was untenable and changed strategic direction by adopting a policy of disclosure and improved cooperation. — Iraq’s firmly established “cheat and retreat” pattern made it difficult for U.N. inspectors and Western analysts to accept new Iraqi assertions at face value. — A liability of intelligence analysis is that once a party has been proven to be an effective deceiver, that knowledge becomes a heavy factor in the calculation of the analytical observer.

Tom Blanton, director of the nonprofit NSA, called the document a “remarkable CIA mea culpa.” To which Battleland adds only: mea maxima culpa."

It kept interest rates at 0.1%, a record low, and voted by a majority of 8-1 to increase the government bond-buying by an additional £100 billion, taking the total stock of asset purchases to £745 billion. The program is expected to be completed around the turn of the year with the pace of purchases slowing, roughly by half, from current levels.

""There are signs of consumer spending and services output picking up, following the easing of Covid-related restrictions on economic activity,"" it said in the statement. ""Recent additional announcements of easier monetary and fiscal policy will help to support the recovery. Downside risks to the global outlook remain, however, including from the spread of Covid-19 within emerging market economies and from a return to a higher rate of infection in advanced economies.""

Yesterday the government also announced the inflation rate reached an annual 0.5% in May, the lowest in four years, down from 0.8% in April and 1.8% at the start of the year. It has a target of 2%. CPI is expected to fall further in coming quarters, largely reflecting the weakness of demand, said the central bank.

Life is slowly starting to return to normal in the U.K. as measures are lifted, but the data reveals the toll the lockdown took. The economy contracted 20.4% in April, following a 6% fall in March. This was the steepest decline in output since records began in 1997 and three times worse than during the global financial crisis. From the peak in February 2008 to the lowest point of March 2009, GDP contracted 6.9%.

Services output, which makes up 79.6% of the U.K. economy, contracted 19% in April. Accommodation and food services declined 88%.

789,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as an anti-vaccine advocate and President-elect Donald Trump as the person who asked him to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety.,True,The article discusses the actions of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in leading a new government commission on vaccine safety and the response of the medical community expressing concerns about this.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that President-elect Donald Trump asked him to lead a new government commission on vaccine safety . But science on this issue is already clear; numerous studies show that vaccines are safe and effective, and that serious side effects are rare.

On January 10, Kennedy met with the president-elect at Trump Tower, and later told reporters about the new commission. However, the Trump administration did not confirm that such a commission was in the works. A spokesperson for Trump said only that the president-elect was ""exploring the possibility of forming a committee on autism,"" according to The New York Times . This response may reference the proposed, but discredited link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Members of the medical community quickly expressed strong concerns about the possibility of a government committee on vaccine safety, headed by an anti-vaccine advocate.

""Claims that vaccines are linked to autism or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature,"" Dr. Fernando Stein, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and Dr. Karen Remley, executive vice president of the AAP, said in a statement . ""Vaccines are safe. Vaccines are effective. Vaccines save lives,"" the statement said.

But how do doctors know this?

First, the United States requires that all vaccines undergo extensive testing on safety and effectiveness before they can be brought to market, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And once vaccines are on the market, there are several systems in place to monitor the safety of the treatments within the general population.

These studies do show that, like all medicines, vaccines come with a small risk of side effects, but these side effects are rarely serious. What's more, the alternative of not vaccinating a child also comes with risks, because vaccines prevent diseases that can be dangerous and sometimes fatal, the CDC said. For each approved vaccine, researchers have determined that the benefits outweigh the risks.

Here's a look at some of the data behind vaccine safety and effectiveness:
• Over the past two decades, childhood vaccines have saved the lives of 732,000 U.S. children and prevented more than 300 million kids from getting sick, according to a 2014 study from the CDC.
• Nearly 90 percent of vaccine side effects are not serious, according to the CDC.
• More than 20 rigorous scientific studies have shown that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism, according to the CDC . The original study that claimed to find such a link has been discredited, and was retracted.
• A 2011 report from the National Academy of Medicine reviewed more than 1,000 vaccine studies and concluded that serious reactions to vaccines are extremely rare.
• The MMR vaccine can cause fevers, and some children who develop a fever can have a seizure; these are called fever-triggered seizures. However, studies show there is one case of fever-triggered seizure for every 3,000 to 4,000 children who receive this vaccine. And these seizures almost never cause harm over the long term, the 2011 review said.
• About one in 10 children who is infected with measles develops an ear infection, and such infections can result in permanent hearing loss, according to the CDC.
• For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die from the disease, the CDC said.
• Two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles, the CDC said.
• In rare cases, the rotavirus vaccine, called RotaTeq, is linked to the development of a serious intestinal disorder called intussusception. A 2014 study found that for every 65,000 children who received this vaccine, there was one case of intussusception.
• A 2011 study found that the rotavirus vaccine had prevented 65,000 U.S. children from being hospitalized with rotavirus since 2006.
• A 2012 study found that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is linked with an increased risk of fainting. The study, which included nearly 200,000 girls who received at least one dose of the Gardasil HPV vaccine, found that there were 24 cases of fainting per 1,000 people on the day of vaccination. For comparison, there were an average of four cases of fainting per 1,000 people when studied months after vaccination.
• The HPV vaccine was introduced in 2006, and during the next four years, the rate of HPV infections among teen girls decreased by 56 percent, despite a relatively low vaccination rate in this age group, according to a 2013 study . (HPV infections in women increase the risk of cervical cancer.)
• Studies on the safety of the chicken-pox vaccine found that about 3 percent of children had a mild, chicken-pox-like rash after the first dose of the vaccine, according to the CDC. On average, these children had two to five lesions, compared with the typical 250 to 500 lesions found in children who contract the actual illness, according to the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC), a nonprofit organization funded by the CDC that creates and distributes educational materials on vaccines.
• Although chicken pox is usually a mild disease, it can cause serious complications, including bacterial infections of the skin, pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and blood stream infections, according to the CDC. Before the introduction of the chicken pox vaccine, there were about 4 million cases of chicken pox in the United States per year, and of these, an estimated 11,000 people went to the hospital with complications and 100 people died from the disease, the IAC said.
• After the introduction of the chicken pox vaccine, cases of the disease fell nearly 80 percent in the U.S. over a decade, according to a 2012 study."
790,True,"The article discusses the theory of chemtrails, which is a conspiracy theory about covert global operations of chemical spraying technology.",True,The article mentions US eco expert Michael Tamez as the source of the theory and refers to a covert global operation of chemical spraying technology.,True,"The article talks about the use of chemtrails for more than three decades and the impact they have on the environment, weather, and food production.",True,"The article mentions that chemtrails could cause biblical style floods, extreme weather events, crop failure, and droughts.",True,The article connects various events and observations to support the theory of chemtrails and questions the motives behind the spraying technology.,True,The article suggests that the spraying technology is being kept secret from the public and implies the intentions of those behind it to mislead.,"And the ""covert operation"" could allegedly cause biblical style floods that will pour down toxic chemicals including lead and mercury leaving catastrophic results. US eco expert Michael Tamez says the little trails of clouds that you see left behind by jet aircraft are more sinister than the average human realises. And that it's all to do with ""Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering"" that is being kept secret from the public.

Explaining the theory, he says that there's no way the line-like clouds that are left by aircraft are responsible for the long lasting patterns in the skies. He told Express.co.uk: ""They’re long trails of cirrus clouds that stretch across the horizon and then spread out across the sky. ""After about a half hour or so, they begin to appear foggy and disappear into the air. ""It cannot be jet exhaust either since normal jet fuel contrail dissipates within seconds after the aircraft has passed.""

Mr Tamez, who has written a number of books and is an environmental expert, says Chemtrails have been used for more than three decades. But that they could lead to absolute devastation. He added: ""These cloudlike trails are known as Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering. ""It’s a covert global operation of chemical spraying technology designed to deliver sulfide gasses to the earth’s atmosphere to control the amount of carbon dioxide present. ""This technology has been in use since the 1980’s.

""Chemtrails are said to mimic the natural process of sulfuric action from the world’s volcanoes. ""What’s not mentioned are the side–effects we are now really starting to see. Just as in most chemicals approved by the government, the long term use of sulfur aerosol spraying has not been tested for safety."" He also says the Chemtrails are having an impact on how the Sun reacts with the Earth and it could even cause extreme weather events. He continued: ""The strength of the sun is also being diluted from the whitening effect of chemical aerosol geoengineering. ""This is causing crop failure which then leads us to rely on the government to produce more chemically grown and genetically engineered foods. ""These chemtrails can also cause extreme and prolonged periods of drought. ""Never before have we witnessed such an extreme amount of weather fluctuation across the globe. ""Extreme droughts and massive rainfalls indicate the planet is out of balance. It is also believed that chemtrails, along with electromagnetic pollution and genetic engineering, have greatly attributed to the ever disappearing honeybee population, which is another catastrophe in the making.""

Flooding is just one aspect Mr Tamez is concerned about adding that the components of the rain clouds are toxic. He added: ""One of the other components found in chemtrails are barium salts. ""The chemical reaction of barium salts in the sky is said to cause water moisture to be retained in real clouds – which could be contributing to the recent spike in widespread global flooding. ""Research shows that barium salts have the capability to receive and conduct radio waves.

""What’s interesting about barium salts is that chemtrails are sprayed in straight lines across the sky – usually in multiple directions. ""Sometimes it even looks like they’re playing tic-tac-toe in the sky! ""This tic-tac-toe pattern creates a grid. The barium salt radio wave grid then becomes a giant antenna, which can be used to send and receive data. ""The craziest thing is that no one would even think to question it or connect the dots. They can just call it an 'act of God'. Are you paying attention yet? ""My biggest question is why? Who’s behind this spraying technology and what’s the agenda? When is enough, enough?

""Is it an effort to control the global population? Do they want us to depend solely on them to manufacture our food for us? ""Are they trying to dumb us down so we don’t think for ourselves? Is it an attempt to start another world war? I’ll let you make an informed decision about it."" While some are skeptical about the theory behind Chemtrails, Mr Tamez believes there's nothing natural about them. He added: ""Regardless of your viewpoint on chemtrails, it is pretty clear that normal jet fuel does not linger for minutes and even hours eventually causing a white hazed sunny daytime sky. ""This is not normal or natural. ""I want to bring awareness about the toxic chemicals that we are exposed to without our knowledge or permission. Since this is a global occurrence, it seems like at this point all we can do is detoxify our bodies of all metals and chemicals, through good nutrition and heavy metal cleanses. ""Then remember the natural beauty of this planet as it once was.""

The website Contrailscience.com aims to debunk the Chemtrails conspiracy theory. It says that aircraft contrails are just what we have always been told they are - condensation trails. The official definition is that when the air a jet flies through is cold enough (around -40C or colder), the air and exhaust fuel will instantly freeze and spread out into the clouds that are seen. The website states: “The chemtrail conspiracy theory seems to frequently misidentify ordinary contrails as “chemtrails” – some kind of secret spraying program.” It says it has “tried to gather all the debunks of this evidence in one place”. One of the main pieces of evidence the conspiracists claim is that historically normal contrails used to dissipate in a few seconds, or minutes, but the new chemtrails last much longer. But the debunking site has produced evidence and photographs showing lingering contrails dating back to 1918 - long before the conspiracy was ever dreamed of."
791,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,There is no mention of any specific actors or individuals in the article.,False,The article does not discuss any actions or motives of actors.,False,There are no threats mentioned in the article.,False,There are no patterns or connections mentioned in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"Alkyl halides (RX, where R is an alkyl group and X is F, Cl, Br, or I) are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary according to the degree of substitution at the carbon to which the halogen is attached. In a primary alkyl halide, the carbon that bears the halogen is directly bonded to one other carbon, in a secondary alkyl halide to two, and in a tertiary alkyl halide to three.

The methods used to prepare alkyl halides and the reactions that alkyl halides undergo frequently depend on whether the alkyl halide is primary, secondary, or tertiary.

A halogen substituent draws the electrons in the C―X bond toward itself, giving the carbon a partial positive charge (δ+) and the halogen a partial negative charge (δ-). The presence of the resulting polar covalent bond makes most alkyl halides polar compounds. Because the bond dipole (the measure of the separation of charge) of a C―X bond is the product of a charge term (largest for fluorine and smallest for iodine) and a distance term (smallest for fluorine and largest for iodine), the molecular dipole moments of alkyl halides do not vary much from one halogen to another.

The most important reactions of organohalogen compounds involve breaking the carbon-halogen bond by processes in which the halogen retains both of the electrons from the original bond and is lost as a negatively charged ion (X−). Consistent with the order of carbon-halogen bond strengths, in which the bond to fluorine is the strongest and the bond to iodine the weakest of the carbon-halogen bonds, fluorides are normally observed to be the least reactive of the alkyl halides and iodides the most reactive.

The boiling points of ethyl halides increase as the atomic number of the halogen increases. With increasing atomic number the halogen becomes more polarizable, meaning that the electric field associated with the atom is more easily distorted by the presence of nearby electric fields. Fluorine is the least polarizable of the halogens and iodine the most polarizable. An increased polarizability is associated with stronger intermolecular attractive forces of the London dispersion type (see chemical bonding: Intermolecular forces) and therefore with an increased boiling point.

Multiple halogen substitution tends to increase the boiling point: CH Cl boils at −24 °C (−11 °F), CH Cl at 40 °C (104 °F), CHCl at 61 °C (142 °F), and CCl at 77 °C (171 °F). Multiple fluorine substitution is an exception, however: CH CH F boils at −32 °C (−26 °F), CH CHF at −25 °C (−13 °F), CH CF at −47 °C (−53 °F), and CF CF at −78 °C (−108 °F). By reducing the molecular polarizability, multiple fluorine substitution weakens the strength of dispersion forces between molecules. In the liquid state these weakened intermolecular attractive forces are reflected in unusually low boiling points, and in the solid state they are responsible for the novel properties of fluorocarbon polymers.

The densities of alkyl halides are related to intermolecular attractive forces and tend to parallel boiling points, alkyl fluorides being the least dense and alkyl iodides the most dense. In general, alkyl fluorides and chlorides are less dense than water, and bromides and iodides are more dense than water. Alkyl halides are not soluble in water."

The dilemmas around how to define deceptive speech and how to check rank duplicity bedevil every modern capitalist society.

Past efforts suggest both key actions to consider and some cautions about how hard the task will be.

The most effective approach depends on a combination of meaningful self-regulation by the business community, innovative fraud policing and the willingness of political leaders and media elites to stand up for truthful public communication. At the moment, perhaps because of the extent to which Americans have come to disagree about what counts as “truth,” each of these requirements seems in short supply.

Anti-fraud efforts have an especially rich history in the United States, connecting such disparate topics as adulterated fertilizers, bogus patent medicines, and fly-by-night mail order firms, endemic investment swindles and bait-and-switch consumer advertising, and, more recently, telemarketing scams and misleading sales pitches for debt products like residential mortgages.

Every generation, Americans relearn that deceptive business practices not only harm investors and consumers, but also hurt honest firms and undermine broader economic confidence. What then to do about it?

One recurring impulse has been to deny the worst liars access to the marketplace. After the Civil War, the American Post Office Department invented the fraud order, which tackled the problem of deceptive long-distance marketing by denying allegedly duplicitous firms access to the mails. In the early 20th century, the new network of Better Business Bureaus began to circulate suggestions to newspapers and magazines that ads from especially dodgy marketers were “not in the public interest.” More recently, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have collaborated on Operation Chokepoint, which has denied sellers of bogus goods and services access to the online payment system.

The problem of fake news has prompted analogous countermeasures, this time implemented by social media companies like Facebook FB, and Google GOOG, GOOGL, . These companies have banned the producers of phony news accounts from using their online advertising services.

Efforts to cast out commercial fabricators from the marketplace have the big advantage of immediate, quick impact. But America’s history of anti-fraud regulation suggests important limitations as well. There is the whack-a-mole problem, since cheats and deceivers often respond to fraud orders and similar tactics by relaunching businesses under different names.

Such summary modes of dispensing justice also clash with American commitments to the rule of law, and so prompt complaints about exercises of raw power that seem more consistent with autocratic regimes. Faced with such critiques, most anti-fraud agencies eventually create procedural protections against unfair treatment: notice of impending bans from access to the marketplace, access to incriminating evidence and an opportunity to mount a defense through formal hearings.

The resulting reforms (in the 1910s and 1920s for mail fraud orders, in the 1950s and 1960s for Better Business Bureau recommendations that media outlets shun specific advertisers) made anti-fraud enforcement fairer. But they did so at the cost of slowing down enforcement actions and diminishing their effects.

The history of American anti-fraud policing suggests there is no magic bullet to the endemic problem of deception in the marketplace or the public square. Criminal prosecutions of the worst offenders can make a difference, though constitutional protections for free speech and the global reach of the internet complicate this potential means of curbing fake news.

Well-conceived public education may be even more important, whether undertaken by government agencies, NGOs or the media. Another emerging strategy to curb bogus news emphasizes this approach. The idea is to rely on crowdsourced tagging on social media of stories as “disputed,” along with work by journalistic gatekeepers to adjudicate such allegations.

Read:The next conversation about fake news needs to be this one

As this example suggests, we will never escape the need to invest trusted arbiters with the authority to label some deceptive practices as illicit. And unless we are willing to tolerate draconian regulatory actions, we will never banish duplicity entirely from our economic or political life.

Our best option is to tailor laws and design institutions with the goal of containing fakery and fraud, an objective that depends as much on the operation of social norms and shaming techniques as it does on formal penalties and the cultivation of savvier consumers of products, investment pitches and news.

This approach is far from perfect. But it can limit the impact of deceitful speech, and so the corrosive threats to our economy and our democracy.

Reveal them early and often. If investigators find out late in the process, through the polygraph interrogation or from sources, that you’re a regular stoner, say, or that your father is an arms smuggler, it will not reflect well on your trustworthiness. “This is the very last question we ask in the polygraph,” Patrick says. “ ‘Is there anything else that you want to tell us that we haven’t talked about?’ ”"

It presents evidence and arguments from both sides, highlighting a pattern of debate and ongoing research.",False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public in the article.,"No public health issue of recent years has attracted such heated debate as the question of whether the MMR vaccine can cause autism. The MMR jab combines three childhood vaccines, against measles, mumps and rubella, into one injection, which is first given to children at around 12-18 months. It has virtually eradicated these diseases from the UK, and throughout the world it has saved hundreds of lives. Recent years, however, have seen the rates of MMR vaccination decline. In some areas of the UK, only 60% of children are receiving MMR. This decline has already let to a rise in the number of measles infections, and there are fears of an epidemic outbreak. The reason for all the concern over MMR is the suggestion that the vaccine might in fact be damaging some of the children it was supposed to protect. Rosemary Kessick's 16-year-old son William is severely autistic. Shortly after William had his MMR shot, Rosemary noticed a change in his behaviour. He also started suffering from recurring bowel problems. Convinced the three things were connected, she took William to the Royal Free Hospital in north London to see Dr Andrew Wakefield, a specialist in bowel diseases. Wakefield became convinced that William and a number of other children he had examined were suffering from a new kind of bowel disease that could be linked to their autism. What's more, he started to wonder whether this condition was being caused by the MMR vaccine. At the press conference to coincide with the publication of this research he suggested that the combined MMR jab should not be used. The result was a media storm. Ever since, scientists have been looking at the evidence to see whether there really is a link between autism and the vaccine. The medical community has relied mainly on epidemiology - the statistical study of large populations. These studies have overwhelmingly found no link between autism and MMR. Opponents claim that some of these studies might have flaws, but there are over a dozen epidemiological studies in different countries that use different techniques that have reached the same conclusion. At the very least, these studies show that the large increases in rates of autism that have been reported in many countries around the world cannot be due to MMR. However, the opponents of the vaccine point out that epidemiology can't rule out an increased risk to a small number of children - a vulnerable subset. They pointed to distinctive features of some of the autistic children that they said was evidence of a possible connection with MMR. Firstly, these children seemed to have a novel bowel disease that was unique to children with autism; and in 2002 Wakefield, working with virologist Prof John O'Leary, claimed to have found the measles virus inside tissue samples from autistic children. Since then, debate has raged over these claims. Little independent clinical research into these claims has been funded - to the anger of many parents. But now at last the deadlock is being broken. Timothy Buie is a paediatric gastroenterologist in Boston. What makes him unique is that he works in a clinic that specialises in the care of children with autism and related disorders. Like Dr Wakefield, he has found that many of these children do have real bowel problems that are worthy of investigation. But despite having performed colonoscopies on hundreds of children, both with and without autism, Dr Buie has so far seen nothing that convinces him the autistic children have a new or distinctive form of bowel disease. His research is still ongoing, but it casts doubt on one aspect of the Wakefield hypothesis. But perhaps the most crucial question is whether the measles virus really is persisting in the bodies of autistic children; and now that question too has been investigated. A new, unpublished study has examined blood samples from a group of 100 autistic children and 200 children without autism. These samples have been examined using the most sensitive methods available. They found 99% of the samples contained no trace of the measles virus, and the samples that did contain the virus were just as likely to be from non-autistic children. The study therefore found no evidence of any link between MMR and autism."

A halogen substituent draws the electrons in the C―X bond toward itself, giving the carbon a partial positive charge (δ+) and the halogen a partial negative charge (δ-). The presence of the resulting polar covalent bond makes most alkyl halides polar compounds. Because the bond dipole (the measure of the separation of charge) of a C―X bond is the product of a charge term (largest for fluorine and smallest for iodine) and a distance term (smallest for fluorine and largest for iodine), the molecular dipole moments of alkyl halides do not vary much from one halogen to another.

The most important reactions of organohalogen compounds involve breaking the carbon-halogen bond by processes in which the halogen retains both of the electrons from the original bond and is lost as a negatively charged ion (X−). Consistent with the order of carbon-halogen bond strengths, in which the bond to fluorine is the strongest and the bond to iodine the weakest of the carbon-halogen bonds, fluorides are normally observed to be the least reactive of the alkyl halides and iodides the most reactive.

The boiling points of ethyl halides increase as the atomic number of the halogen increases. With increasing atomic number the halogen becomes more polarizable, meaning that the electric field associated with the atom is more easily distorted by the presence of nearby electric fields. Fluorine is the least polarizable of the halogens and iodine the most polarizable. An increased polarizability is associated with stronger intermolecular attractive forces of the London dispersion type (see chemical bonding: Intermolecular forces) and therefore with an increased boiling point.

Multiple halogen substitution tends to increase the boiling point: CH Cl boils at −24 °C (−11 °F), CH Cl at 40 °C (104 °F), CHCl at 61 °C (142 °F), and CCl at 77 °C (171 °F). Multiple fluorine substitution is an exception, however: CH CH F boils at −32 °C (−26 °F), CH CHF at −25 °C (−13 °F), CH CF at −47 °C (−53 °F), and CF CF at −78 °C (−108 °F). By reducing the molecular polarizability, multiple fluorine substitution weakens the strength of dispersion forces between molecules. In the liquid state these weakened intermolecular attractive forces are reflected in unusually low boiling points, and in the solid state they are responsible for the novel properties of fluorocarbon polymers.

The densities of alkyl halides are related to intermolecular attractive forces and tend to parallel boiling points, alkyl fluorides being the least dense and alkyl iodides the most dense. In general, alkyl fluorides and chlorides are less dense than water, and bromides and iodides are more dense than water. Alkyl halides are not soluble in water."

Most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of 2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess, “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.”

Muhammad was born around 570, AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia). His father died before he was born and he was raised first by his grandfather and then his uncle. He belonged to a poor but respectable family of the Quraysh tribe. The family was active in Meccan politics and trade.

Many of the tribes living in the Arabian Peninsula at the time were nomadic, trading goods as they crisscrossed the desert. Most tribes were polytheistic, worshipping their own set of gods. The town of Mecca was an important trading and religious center, home to many temples and worship sites where the devoted prayed to the idols of these gods. The most famous site was the Kaaba (meaning cube in Arabic). It is believed to have been built by Abraham (Ibrahim to Muslims) and his son Ismail. Gradually the people of Mecca turned to polytheism and idolatry. Of all the gods worshipped, it is believed that Allah was considered the greatest and the only one without an idol.

In his early teens, Muhammad worked in a camel caravan, following in the footsteps of many people his age, born of meager wealth. Working for his uncle, he gained experience in commercial trade traveling to Syria and eventually from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. In time, Muhammad earned a reputation as honest and sincere, acquiring the nickname “al-Amin” meaning faithful or trustworthy.

In his early 20s, Muhammad began working for a wealthy merchant woman named Khadijah, 15 years his senior. She soon became attracted to this young, accomplished man and proposed marriage. He accepted and over the years the happy union brought several children. Not all lived to adulthood, but one, Fatima, would marry Muhammad’s cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib, whom Shi’ite Muslims regard as Muhammad’s successor.

Muhammad was also very religious, occasionally taking journeys of devotion to sacred sites near Mecca. On one of his pilgrimages in 610, he was meditating in a cave on Mount Jabal aI-Nour. The Angel Gabriel appeared and relayed the word of God: “Recite in the name of your Lord who creates, creates man from a clot! Recite for your lord is most generous….” These words became the opening verses of sūrah (chapter) 96 of the Qur'an. Most Islamic historians believe Muhammad was initially disturbed by the revelations and that he didn’t reveal them publicly for several years. However, Shi’a tradition states he welcomed the message from the Angel Gabriel and was deeply inspired to share his experience with other potential believers.

Islamic tradition holds that the first persons to believe were his wife, Khadija and his close friend Abu Bakr (regarded as the successor to Muhammad by Sunni Muslims). Soon, Muhammad began to gather a small following, initially encountering no opposition. Most people in Mecca either ignored him or mocked him as just another prophet. However, when his message condemned idol worship and polytheism, many of Mecca’s tribal leaders began to see Muhammad and his message as a threat. Besides going against long standing beliefs, the condemnation of idol worship had economic consequences for merchants who catered to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Mecca every year. This was especially true for members of Muhammad’s own tribe, the Quraysh, who were the guardians of the Kaaba. Sensing a threat, Mecca’s merchants and leaders offered Muhammad incentives to abandon his preaching, but he refused.

Increasingly, the resistance to Muhammed and his followers grew and they were eventually forced to emigrate from Mecca to Medina, a city 260 miles to the north in 622. This event marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. There Muhammad was instrumental in bringing an end to a civil war raging amongst several of the city’s tribes. Muhammad settled in Medina, building his Muslim community and gradually gathering acceptance and more followers.

Between 624 and 628, the Muslims were involved in a series of battles for their survival. In the final major confrontation, The Battle of the Trench and Siege of Medina, Muhammad and his followers prevailed and a treaty was signed. The treaty was broken by the Meccan allies a year later. By now, Muhammad had plenty of forces and the balance of power had shifted away from the Meccan leaders to him. In 630, the Muslim army marched into Mecca, taking the city with minimum casualties. Muhammad gave amnesty to many of the Meccan leaders who had opposed him and pardoned many others. Most of the Meccan population converted to Islam. Muhammad and his followers then proceeded to destroy all of the statues of pagan gods in and around the Kaaba.

After the conflict with Mecca was finally settled, Muhammad took his first true Islamic pilgrimage to that city and in March, 632, he delivered his last sermon at Mount Arafat. Upon his return to Medina to his wife’s home, he fell ill for several days. He died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62, and was buried at al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) one of the first mosques built by Muhammad in Medina."

Edward Hunter, who was also a CIA agent, warned Americans that post-revolutionary China was using insidious and heretofore unknown psychological techniques to force the Chinese into the Communist Party. He labelled these techniques with the term ‘brainwashing’, a derisive translation of the Chinese his-nao, which literally means ‘to cleanse the mind’. Hunter’s theories not only reached a receptive audience, but were also quickly verified by other experts, who described similar techniques in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union . Americans were alerted to the possibility that the Communists had ‘cracked the brain’s code’ and were capable not only of controlling but of changing the will of their fellow citizens. Psychologist Joost Meerloo, a Dutch émigré from Nazi-occupied Holland, warned in his 1956 book Rape of the Mind that brainwashing techniques, which he dubbed with the far more sinister appellation menticide, were being used on an unsuspecting American public:

It is now technically possible to bring the human mind into a condition of enslavement and submission ... the totalitarians [Meerloo’s euphemism for any Communist government] ... influence the mind so slowly and indirectly that we may not even realize what they have done to us.

The reaction of Americans was rather spectacular. Quite rapidly, a panic over the threat of brainwashing spread throughout the country. Americans had already been conditioned to fear nuclear war, but the imagined loss of cherished American autonomy and free will was even more terrifying. Brainwashing embodied cultural fears of losing control and Meerloo’s paradigm for menticide became America’s paradigm for anxiety."

Breeding converts incoming subcritical reload fuel into new critical fuel, allowing a breed-burn wave to propagate. The concept works on the basis that breed-burn waves and the fuel move relative to one another. Thus either the fuel or the waves may move relative to the stationary observer. The most practical embodiments of the TWR involve moving the fuel while keeping the nuclear reactions in one place−sometimes referred to as the standing wave reactor (SWR). TWRs can operate with uranium reload fuels including totally depleted uranium, natural uranium, and low-enriched fuel (e.g., 5.5% 235U and below), which ordinarily would not be critical in a fast spectrum. Spent light water reactor (LWR) fuel may also serve as TWR reload fuel. In each of these cases, very efficient fuel usage and significant reduction of waste volumes are achieved without the need for reprocessing. The ultimate advantages of the TWR are realized when the reload fuel is depleted uranium, where after the startup period, no enrichment facilities are needed to sustain the first reactor and a chain of successor reactors. TerraPower's conceptual and engineering design and associated technology development activities have been underway since late 2006, with over 50 institutions working in a highly coordinated effort to place the first unit in operation by 2026. This paper summarizes the TWR technology: its development program, its progress, and an analysis of its social and economic benefits."

But many experts say there’s little evidence that hot, sunny days actually make beaches safer.

Although sunlight can help kill coronaviruses on surfaces, it doesn’t work fast enough to help beachgoers, said Andrea Armani, a professor of chemical engineering and materials science at USC.

“It doesn’t make it safe to go out to the beach because the time it takes for the sun to kill the virus is exceptionally long,” Armani said.

A coronavirus’ outer layer weakens as the temperature rises, Armani said. So when ultraviolet light from the sun heats up surfaces where the virus lands, its survival period will be somewhat shorter. (How much shorter depends on multiple factors, she added.)

But the sun won’t make much difference in spots where shade or clouds reduce the optical intensity of sunlight. Nor will sunshine prevent the virus from spreading from person to person through droplets of saliva or mucus in the air.

Karin Michels, chair of the epidemiology department at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, said there was “no good data” to support the idea that the UV in sunlight would make any difference in the coronavirus infection rate.

The risk, she said, depends more on how many people show up to the beach and whether they can practice proper physical distancing.

Judging from the photos of people flocking to Orange County beaches during last weekend’s heat wave, that hasn’t seemed to be the case, she said.

“People don’t stay apart enough,” she said, “and so that is also an argument to be a little concerned.”

Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, agreed that much of the risk hinged on human behavior.

“While it is true that the UV radiation contained in sunlight is detrimental to the [virus’] viability on surfaces, many beach activities would give the virus an opportunity to pass — not from surfaces — but from person to person,” he said in an email.

Armani also pointed out that people are less likely to have opportunities to wash their hands at the beach, and are probably less likely to wear face masks.

“A lot of those standards are going to be harder to maintain at the beach,” she said.

The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight that reaches the Earth’s surface, which includes the types known as UVA and UVB, should not be confused with a higher-energy form known as UVC.

UVC can be used to quickly kill pathogens on surfaces in controlled settings such as hospitals, but it’s extremely dangerous and can potentially burn a person’s skin or even blind them, according to Jim Malley, an environmental engineer at the University of New Hampshire."

The article also mentions the secrecy surrounding the gang's tax records and the lack of information sharing between HMRC and intelligence agencies.","£80MILLION of British taxpayers' money was stolen and used to fund Osama bin Laden's terror group al-Qaeda, leaked intelligence files have revealed.

A network or British Asian gangsters based across the UK - said to have links to the 7/7 London bombings in which 52 people died - reportedly mounted VAT and benefit fraud against the Treasury.

Over two decades the gang, who operated in London, Buckinghamshire, Birmingham, Northwest England and Scotland, bagged around £8billion of the public's money, an investigation by The Sunday Times revealed.

Part of the colossal sum also came from mortgage and credit card fraud that targeted banks and individuals, the newspaper reports.

The fraudsters allegedly sent 1 per cent of the netted cash - worth £80million - to al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

It is understood the cash was used by the terror group to fund training camps, extremist educational programmes and other terrorist activities.

Top secret intelligence documents held by MI5 are said to show that some of the money reached Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan before he was killed by US special forces in 2011.

Details of the amount extracted from the British taxpayer came from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and Special Branch, which investigated the gang over 20 years.

Some information was discovered on a discarded laptop found in Afghanistan by CIA and MI6 officers hunting for bin Laden in 2001.

HMRC investigations also found links between the gang and 7/7 bombing terrorist Shehzad Tanweer two years before the 2005 attack.

British authorities were first alerted to the the network's activities in 1995.

According to secret police reports at the time an informant said money was placed in bank accounts under false names before being sent out of the country ""for terrorist or drugs purposes"".

The informant said: ""Asian customers are coming in with carrier bags full of cash on a regular basis.""

Despite the findings, one customs officer told The Sunday Times he was prevented from sharing intelligence with MI5 because HMRC wanted to maintain confidentiality of the terror suspects' tax records.

He claimed information sharing could have led to prosecutions that would have taken the gang out of operation.

A source close to the matter told the paper: ""HMRC had no concept of big-picture thinking.

""Post 9/11 it had no information exchange with the Security Service [MI5] and the Secret Intelligence Service [MI6].

""Then, even when in place, this was overridden by the rules that tax files are sacrosanct.

“HMRC still has no concept as to how it should operate as an agency alongside the intelligence agencies in protecting the nation and its interests.”

Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the public accounts committee, said she is considering launching a parliamentary inquiry into the fraud.

She told the newspaper: ""Taxpayer confidentiality is important but where individuals are evading tax to seek to do us harm, then the appropriate agencies should be told.

“HMRC routinely shares information with other agencies so I find it extraordinary that they did not do so in this case.”

But a spokesman for HMRC dismissed the claims that it does not share information in terror cases.

A HMRC statement said: “HMRC does and always has passed information (within minutes if necessary) to other law enforcement agencies and the intelligence services when dealing with serious crime or terrorism – taxpayer confidentiality doesn’t come into it.

“HMRC takes its critical role in the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism very seriously.

""We work side-by-side with the intelligence services, law enforcement partners, and across Government, to break up criminal gangs and disrupt terror funding.

""In 2017-18 alone, we collected and protected more than £3.3 billion through our work fighting organised crime, and have brought more than 880 organised criminals to justice since 2010.”

About half a dozen states including Texas and Arizona are grappling with a rising number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds, fanning concerns that the reopening of the U.S. economy may spark a second wave of infections.

The rally in global stocks came crashing down on Thursday over worries of a pandemic resurgence. The last time the S&P 500 and Dow fell as much in one day was in March, when U.S. coronavirus cases began surging.

A recent spike in cases in about a dozen states partially reflects increased testing. But many of those states are also seeing rising hospitalizations and some are beginning to run short on intensive care unit (ICU) beds.

Texas has seen record hospitalizations for three days in a row, and in North Carolina only 13% of the state's ICU beds are available due to severe COVID-19 cases. Houston's mayor said the city was ready to turn its NFL stadium into a make-shift hospital if necessary.

Arizona has seen a record number of hospitalizations at 1,291. The state health director told hospitals this week to activate emergency plans and increase ICU capacity. About three-quarters of the state's ICU beds are filled, according to the state website.

“You’re really crossing a threshold in Arizona,"" said Jared Baeten, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington. ""The alarming thing would be if the numbers start to rise in places that have clearly already peaked and are on their downtrend,"" he said, referring to New York and other Northeastern states where new cases and deaths have plummeted.

Health experts worry there could be a further rise in infections from nationwide protests over racial injustice and police brutality that packed people together starting two weeks ago.

Arizona, Utah and New Mexico all posted rises in new cases of 40% or higher for the week ended June 7, compared with the prior seven days, according to a Reuters analysis. New cases rose in Florida, Arkansas, South Carolina and North Carolina by more than 30% in the past week.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, told Canada's CBC news that more cases are inevitable as restrictions are lifted.

""We also as a whole have been going down with cases,"" Fauci said. ""But I think what you mentioned about some states now having an increase in the number of cases makes one pause and be a little bit concerned.""

Even if hospitals are not overwhelmed by coronavirus cases, more hospitalizations mean more deaths in the coming weeks and months, said Spencer Fox, research associate at the University of Texas at Austin.

""We are starting to see very worrying signs about the course the pandemic is taking in cities and states in the U.S. and around the world,"" he said. ""When you start seeing those signs, you need to act fairly quickly.""

Total U.S. coronavirus deaths are now over 113,000, by far the most in the world. That figure could exceed 200,000 at some point in September, Ashish Jha, the head of Harvard's Global Health Institute, told CNN.

Jha said the United States was the only major country to reopen without getting its case growth to a controlled level - defined as a rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus remaining at 5% or lower for at least 14 days. Nationally, that figure has been between 4% and 7% in recent weeks, according to a Reuters analysis.

Health officials have stressed that wearing masks in public and keeping physically apart can greatly reduce transmissions, but many states have not required masks.

""I want the reopening to be successful,"" Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top executive for the county that encompasses Houston, told reporters. ""But I'm growing increasingly concerned that we may be approaching the precipice of a disaster."""

Fewer than 5,000 new cases of the H1N1 virus have been recorded every week for the past six weeks, down from a high of 100,000 last summer. But as the NHS was taken off red alert, questions were asked over why so many doses of the vaccine were ordered but never used. Last night, critics described the Government’s reaction as “excessive”. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “The Government’s reaction to swine flu was excessive and poorly managed. “Of course they should be vigilant to health threats, but they’ve taken that too far, landing taxpayers with a vast bill and unnecessary vaccines.

“It beggars belief that they could have signed so many massive contracts with such a flawed assessment of the threat.” The Department of Health ordered 132 million doses of swine flu jabs so that every person could have two doses each. However it quickly emerged that one dose would be sufficient. Although there were well-publicised reports of severe illness, hospital admissions and deaths, many of those struck down said their illness had only been mild. This deterred many people in the at-risk groups from having the jab. Latest figures show that only 4.25 million people have been vaccinated out of the 17 million offered the inoculation.

And only 13 million doses have so far been delivered to the NHS. The other 119 million ordered doses are either in warehouses or have not yet been manufactured. So far, the cost of the drugs has remained a secret but some estimates suggest the vaccines could have cost as much as £9 a dose, with a total bill of more than £1billion. The Department of Health is trying to negotiate with the drugs companies GSK and Baxter to see if it can cancel some of the order but it is unclear if it will get any money back. Last night, the Government’s top doctor said it was still important for parents to get the under-fives vaccinated in case swine flu makes a return next year.

Sir Liam Donaldson, Chief Medical Officer for England said: “I am pleased to see increasing uptake of vaccine amongst the under-fives. Deaths in this age group have been deeply distressing. When the virus returns I would very much like to see young children already protected. “From now on, most deaths from the pandemic flu virus should be regarded as potentially preventable. “General practitioners have the vaccine and stand ready to offer this vital protection. Parents should contact their doctor to make an appointment. Young children who have the jab will be protected in the next flu season. “Pregnant women and those in all other at-risk groups should continue to have the vaccine as well.”"

The hot, humid exhaust from jet engines mixes with the atmosphere, which at high altitude is of much lower vapor pressure and temperature than the exhaust gas. The water vapor contained in the jet exhaust condenses and may freeze, and this mixing process forms a cloud very similar to the one your hot breath makes on a cold day.

Jet engine exhaust contains carbon dioxide, oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, unburned fuel, soot and metal particles, as well as water vapor. The soot provides condensation sites for the water vapor. Any particles present in the air provide additional sites.

Depending on a plane's altitude, and the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere, contrails may vary in their thickness, extent and duration. The nature and persistence of jet contrails can be used to predict the weather. A thin, short-lived contrail indicates low-humidity air at high altitude, a sign of fair weather, whereas a thick, long-lasting contrail reflects humid air at high altitudes and can be an early indicator of a storm.

The mixing gases contained in the contrail rotate with respect to the ambient air. These regions of rotating flow are called vortices. (Any sharp surface, such as the tip of a wing, can cause vortical flow in its wake if it is sufficiently large or the flow is sufficiently fast.) On occasion, these trailing vortices may interact with one another.

In one well-known example of this fact, the Crow Instability causes the vortices to develop symmetric sinusoidal oscillations and eventually to merge and form vortex rings behind the jet. This instability can be triggered by turbulence in the surrounding air or by local variation in air temperature or density, which may itself be the result of the stratification of the atmosphere. When the contrails are visible and strong, it is possible to see the white streaks become wavy and then leave rings floating high in the sky, like smoke rings from a giant cigar.

Recent research has suggested that the ice clouds contained in contrails cause greenhouse effects and contribute to global warming as part of the insulating blanket of moisture and gases in the atmosphere. Researchers in this area seized on the opportunity presented on September 11 and 12 over the U.S. The complete cessation of commercial air traffic offered a control sky without contrails for use in quantifying the environmental effects of contrails."

Bush describes Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an ""axis of evil.""

Just over a year into his presidency and several months into a war which would eventually become the longest in American history, Bush identified the three countries as the major nodes of a wide-ranging and highly dangerous network of terrorists and other bad actors threatening the United States. The speech outlined the logic behind Bush’s “War on Terror,” a series of military engagements which would define U.S. foreign policy for the next two decades.

Bush speechwriter David Frum is credited with coining the term “axis of evil,” which was meant to evoke the Axis powers against which the United States and its allies fought in World War II. The Bush administration wanted to emphasize the outstanding threat posed by these three “terror states,” arguing that each was in the process of building weapons of mass destruction and supporting terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda. Bush’s father, former president George H.W. Bush, had invaded Iraq in 1990 after repelling the Iraqi invasion of neighboring Kuwait, but left Saddam Hussein in power.

After 9/11, George W. Bush’s administration waited less than a month before invading Afghanistan and deposing the Taliban regime there. It was not long before Bush turned his attention to “regime change” in Iraq. Although there were no direct links between Iraq, Iran and North Korea—Iraq and Iran, in fact, were commonly understood to be geopolitical enemies—the concept of an “axis of evil” united in its desire to harm Americans proved useful to those making the case for a second invasion of Iraq.

Yet unlike the novel coronavirus, this disease is preventable, curable and centuries-old: tuberculosis.

On the occasion of World TB Day, experts warned Tuesday that the sheer number of people impacted by tuberculosis -- which leaves survivors with permanent lung damage -- means there are additional millions globally vulnerable to COVID-19.

TB is latent in one in four people on Earth and has been around for tens of thousands of years. Every year around 10 million people are infected; more than 1.2 million die.

While TB was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization back in 1993, it remains the world's number one infectious killer.

The vast majority of TB deaths occur among poorer populations, meaning the disease is largely out of the mind of policymakers despite its devastating annual toll.

Experts said that global health systems could learn a number of lessons from the fight against TB, for which a vaccine exists and a diagnostic test which takes minutes.

""We know what works to fight COVID-19 from our experience and the tools we have to end TB: infection control, widespread testing, contact tracing,"" said Jose Luis Castro, executive director of The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases.

""Prevention of any disease requires political will -- and prevention remains the biggest tool we have to address COVID-19.""

As of Tuesday 1100 GMT, there had been more than 386,350 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 16,961 of which have proved fatal.

World governments have taken unprecedented peacetime measures to try to slow the spread.

Several European nations have announced country-wide lock downs as well as massive economic stimuli and financial support for businesses and workers.

Grania Brigden, TB director at The Union, told AFP that testing capacity was crucial in tackling both diseases.

""With TB we've struggled with research and development investment to get good, accurate diagnostic tools and better treatment but actually we are there now,"" she said.

""It goes to show that where there is political will things can happen and unfortunately in TB the political will has always been an issue.""

Several countries on the frontline of the TB war are seeing their treatment and testing services disrupted by COVID-19, further straining healthcare systems as the pandemic spreads.

COVID-19 is already affecting supply chains of all medicines and most equipment used to treat other infectious diseases such as face masks and antibiotics.

There is in particular growing concern among the global health community that COVID-19 could especially hit regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia where healthcare systems are woefully under equipped to deal with a spike in cases.

""People affected by TB, HIV and other infectious diseases as well as prisoners, migrants and people living in poverty will be at greater risk of reduced access to healthcare,"" The Union said in a statement.

Of the 4,400 people who die every day from TB, at least 200 of those are children.

While COVID-19 does not appear to cause serious symptoms in children, they are thought to be significant spreaders of the disease to older people.

Brigden said that while TB in children was largely ignored by health responders, they went on to learn several lessons on disease control from them.

""We understand that focusing on children is a key area,"" she said.

""I hope that what comes out of this is the understanding that global health is important and that we need to protect vulnerable and at-risk people outside our own bubbles."""
814,True,The article discusses the speculation that the arrest and interrogation of Iranian-Americans may be an attempt to set up a 'hostage exchange' and that Iranian hard-liners may have instigated the arrests to create a new diplomatic crisis with the West.,True,"The article mentions Iranian officials, Iranian hard-liners, and the U.S. government as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,"The article mentions the ongoing detention of Iranian diplomats, the arrest and interrogation of Iranian-Americans, and the U.S. democracy program as actions related to the conspiracy.",True,The article mentions the possibility of a new diplomatic crisis with the West and the potential harm to Iranian activists as threats resulting from the conspiracy.,True,"The article discusses the connections between the arrest and interrogation of Iranian-Americans, the U.S. democracy program, and the potential motives of Iranian hard-liners.",True,The article mentions speculation and behind-the-scenes talks as elements of secrecy in the conspiracy.,"The pro-democracy program is not Tehran's only sore point with the U.S. Apart from the ongoing nuclear controversy, Iran is angry over the continuing detention of five of its diplomats, arrested during a U.S. raid in Iraq in January. There was some speculation that the arrest and interrogation of Esfandiari and other Iranian-Americans may be an attempt to set up a ""hostage exchange""  the U.S. citizens in return for the Iranian diplomats. Others speculate that Iranian hard-liners may have instigated the Iranian-American arrests as a means of creating a new diplomatic crisis with the West and thus torpedoing pragmatists in the Iranian government who favor better relations with Washington.

Nevertheless, for the last several months, Iranian officials have publicly charged that the U.S. money is pushing for a ""velvet revolution"" in Iran. Iranian officials seem to believe that Esfandiari's center is a conduit for the U.S. effort. In interrogations of Esfandiari lasting as long as eight hours, the questions focused almost entirely on her activities at the Wilson Center. The other Iranian-Americans on espionage charges are Kiam Tajbakhsh, of the Open Society Institute, financed by the American billionaire George Soros, who was working with Iranian government ministries on urban projects; and Parnaz Azima, a journalist with Radio Farda, which is funded by the U.S. government. Azima has not been jailed. Ali Shakeri, a member of the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding at the University of California, is reported to be detained but the case against him is unclear.

Akbar Ganji and Emaddeddin Baghi, two of Iran's most prominent pro-democracy activists, who have served long prison sentences for their activities, are among those who protested the U.S. democracy program. In a letter to international human rights organizations after Esfandiari's imprisonment, Baghi denounced the program as morally unjustifiable for effectively putting Iranian activists in harm's way.

Bush's democracy program is opposed even by some exile groups that support a tough U.S. line against the Islamic regime, including a royalist group led by Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah who seeks to reinstate the monarchy. In an e-mailed comment to TIME, Pahlavi said he ""would not accept funds from any foreign governments."" He said there were ways to support freedom ""without such support coming in the form of governmental funds which invariably ends up hurting those it intends to help by unfairly labeling them as foreign agents.""

Several mainstream Iranian reformers tell TIME that from the start they transmitted their opposition to the democracy program indirectly but clearly to American officials via the back-channel talks. Besides warning that it could trigger a crackdown, they argued that Iran's reform movement had strong popular support and did not want or require foreign help. Outside backing has been an unusually sensitive issue in Iranian politics ever since a CIA-backed coup d'etat in 1953 installed the former Shah. Instead, many of them argue, Iran's democracy movement would be better served if the U.S. lifted sanctions and improved relations with Tehran, which would enable trade and cultural links to be expanded. ""There is no serious individual inside or outside Iran who is going to take this money,"" an Iranian reformer told TIME. ""Anyone having the slightest knowledge of the domestic political situation in Iran would never have created this program."""

The agency's dossier on the group's founding member, Ol' Dirty Bastard has been released in response to a Freedom of information request.

ODB, aka Russell Jones, died of an accidental drug overdose in 2004, after consuming a mixture of cocaine and opiates. 



But the rap group continues and is releasing its 6th album this year.

'The WTC is heavily involved in the sale of drugs, illegal guns, weapons possession, murder, carjacking and other types of violent crime,' according to the Gun.io blog.

Jones was arrested nine times between April 1, 1987, and Jan. 15, 1999, for a range of crimes that included petty larceny, contempt and nonsupport of a child. 



In January 1999, he was charged with attempted murder in the first/second degree, criminal use of a firearm, and unlawful wearing of a body vest, Gun.io reported.

Riddled with violent crime, the late rapper's file refers to the murder of Jerome Estrella aka Boo Boo, by an unnamed member of a gang called the Bloods, who allegedly sometimes acted as enforcers for the WTC. 



The confessed killer allegedly offered to do a deal with detectives to provide information about the WTC.

in the file, documenting the late hip hop star's forays with the law, details the arrest of P Diddy, though no actual connection between the two hip hop stars is made.

The file also describes a drug-deal gone bad that resulted in a shooting and carjacking on Staten Island.

One of those involved was allegedly a suspect in an unsolved murder supposedly ordered by the WTC in retaliation for a robbery.

Some ten pages of the folder are dedicated to a chain of events leading to the murder of a Robert Pooh Johnson in 1997.

After being shot and robbed by men wearing ski masks in his home ODB was interviewed by police. They allegedly made off with $10,000 worth of jewellery. ODB said he knew the gunman who lived down the street from him but did not want to continue with the investigation because of the possible repercussions for his family in the projects. 



The document is heavily redacted and the sequence of events is not clear, but the file claims members of the collective bought a gun used to murder former associate Johnson in 1997.

'Johnson was an associate of the WTC who had a falling out with the group and it is believed that his murder was ordered by someone within the WTC,' the file states.

The files also claim that the Wu-Tang Clan used their record label to launder money.

Once a member had shown their commitment to the WTC, they were 'offered record contracts to record rap type music,'with numerous recording companies set up for this purpose.

'This allows legitimate monies to flow into these accounts along with the proceeds from [redacted].'the files allege."
816,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions several actors, including Presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Donald Trump.",True,"The article discusses the actions taken by Presidents Reagan, Nixon, and Trump, such as launching air strikes and revealing classified information.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,True,The article mentions the disclosure of classified information and the secrecy surrounding it.,"Presidents, moreover, are unique among U.S. government officials in that they have the power to declassify material as they wish. In explaining to the American people why he’d decided to launch air strikes against Libya, Ronald Reagan publicized intelligence linking Muammar al-Qaddafi’s government to the bombing of a nightclub in West Berlin.

And then there’s perhaps the closest historical analogue to Donald Trump’s current predicament: Richard Nixon, in making the case during a press conference that North Korea had illegally downed a U.S. spy plane over international waters, revealed that the U.S. government was capable of intercepting Soviet and North Korean radar signals. “There was no uncertainty whatever as to where this plane was, because we know what [North Korea’s] radar showed,” Nixon told the media. “We, incidentally, know what the Russian radar showed. And all three radars [including America’s] showed exactly the same thing.”

The journalist Seymour Hersh documented what happened next:

The Nixon statement created near-pandemonium at the [National Security Agency]. “I died when I heard it,” one official said. … After Nixon’s statement about the [spy plane], the NSA official says, “The Soviet Union and other countries changed every frequency, every crypt system, every net structure—all at once. It took months to work it out.” At the time of Nixon’s blunder, the Soviets, North Koreans, and Chinese were using relatively simple codes in their radar analyses and the NSA had been able to break those codes and recreate their radar patterns in its systems, giving the United States the incalculable advantage of knowing what the other side was seeing. … [Down in the White House Situation Room, a staffer] attempted a weak joke: “We’re going to take the President’s clearances away.”

What makes Trump’s disclosures novel in recent American history is that, according to reporting by The Washington Post and others, they appear to have been made without much if any forethought, and drew on classified information gathered by another country rather than U.S. intelligence agencies. Naftali struggled to come up with precedents for such circumstances—at least any that are publicly known. The Post reports that Trump mentioned specific intelligence, involving an ISIS plot to exploit laptops on airplanes, to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador while gloating about the “great intel” he receives, and that White House officials then rushed to minimize the fallout from the remarks. The information, the paper notes, came from a U.S. partner—reportedly Israel—through channels “so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government,” and without the partner’s permission. (On Tuesday, Trump’s national-security adviser tried to defend the president by saying Trump “wasn’t even aware where this information came from.”)"
817,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the systems theorists who conducted the analysis.,True,The article discusses the analysis conducted by the systems theorists and the discovery of the distinct bow-tie shape of global corporate control.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Three systems theorists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich have taken a database listing 37 million companies and investors worldwide and analyzed all 43,060 transnational corporations and share ownerships linking them. They built a model of who owns what and what their revenues are and mapped the whole edifice of economic power.

They discovered that global corporate control has a distinct bow-tie shape, with a dominant core of 147 firms radiating out from the middle. Each of these 147 own interlocking stakes of one another and together they control 40% of the wealth in the network. A total of 737 control 80% of it all. The top 20 are at the bottom of the post. This is, say the paper's authors, the first map of the structure of global corporate control.

The #occupy movement will eat this up as evidence for massive redistribution of wealth. The New Scientist talked to one systems theorist who is ""disconcerted"" at the level of interconnectedness, but not surprised. Such structures occur commonly in biology, things like fungus, lichen and weeds. Economists say the danger comes when you combine hyperconnection with the concentration of power. The Swiss scientists warn that this can lead to an unstable environment. No Scheisse, Sherlock.

But the web of corporate control is not de facto a conspiracy of world domination. There are many reasons for tightly bundled nodes and connections: anti-takeover strategies, reduction of transaction costs, risk sharing, increasing trust and groups of interest.

A few caveats with the data set: It excludes GSEs and privately-held companies and is dominated by banks, institutional investors and mutual funds that don't always have much in the way of control over assets. Reader danogden left an especially good comment below: ""...pension plans, corporate 401(k) plans and individual funds..manage trillions in assets ultimately belonging to individuals who are predominantly not in the ""1%"". ...There are a number of ""custodian banks"" in the list -- companies who hold the assets of asset managers to ensure timely processing of things like foreign dividend and bond interest, name changes (due to mergers, etc.), foreign currency conversion and the like...Again, they do not own the assets, or even really control the assets — they merely house the assets. A better list would be the actual asset OWNERS, rather than the vendors who manage, house and clear said assets.""

See the top 50 on the control list at the New Scientist. One of the co-authors, Dr. James Glattfelder, says he will be publishing next week the bigger list of 737 companies that control 80% of the global economy. The 147 are included in that group.

These academics can now study the outbreak of a similarly odd phenomenon in India, the reaction, particularly in Kerala, to the death sentence imposed on Saddam Hussein. 



Though we don’t think executing Saddam is a good idea, there is a tinge of the irrational in the reactions in God’s own country. On the day the sentence was announced, there were, according to media reports, spontaneous demonstrations of rage all across the state. 



Newspapers carried banner headlines the next day. It is reported that many children joined the demonstrations. It is to be hoped that the parents of the children will refrain from portraying the poison gas-using tyrant — whose sons used to roam the streets of Baghdad abducting young women they fancied — as a role model.



Other reactions have been equally bizarre. For some odd reason the left parties want India to not only condemn the verdict but also work to rescind it. It’s not clear how India can do so, but rage appears to have overcome logic. 



The Left’s anger, academics can speculate, may have a psychological origin. For the grim-faced Prakash Karat — who may have fancied a Mikhail Suslov (a now obscure Soviet Politburo member)-like role as an ideologue in a one-party state — the actual existing reality of compromising with private capital may result in irrational bursts of rage directed at, among others, Iraqi communists (butchered by Saddam, now a forlorn secular presence in the sectarian Iraqi landscape). 



The CPM leaders in Bengal may be experiencing similar psychological traumas. And then there is the fake rage of the plainly cynical, like Jayalalithaa and the Samajwadi Party who could not care a fig for Iraq, but who smell votes."
819,True,"The article discusses the spread of fake coronavirus content, including conspiracy theories tied to the coronavirus.",True,"The article mentions influential extremists, far-right activists, French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, and President Donald Trump as public figures involved in spreading conspiracy theories.",True,"The article mentions the promotion of bogus medical cures, the creation of online meme banks, and the spreading of conspiracy theories blaming migrants and non-white populations for the coronavirus outbreak.",True,"The article mentions allegations that migrants spread disease, support for President Donald Trump's proposed border wall, and opposition to gun control as threats associated with far-right posts.",True,"The article discusses the use of online tactics, coordination of messaging, and the creation of meme banks by far-right activists.",False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead the public or cover up actions.,"But plenty of other fake coronavirus content continues to thrive online. That includes a slickly produced online video, called “Plandemic,” that garnered millions of views across YouTube, Twitter and Facebook over the weekend by promoting bogus medical cures and other conspiracy theories tied to the coronavirus. The video remains in wide circulation.

One coronavirus-related term, “Coronachan,” has also exploded on social media, first emerging in January and drawing more than 120,000 shares on Twitter in one week in late April, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that tracks extremist groups. (The term is a play on the name of 4chan, a message board that is a favorite gathering spot for the global far right.) In Germany, Telegram groups where influential extremists and far-right activists attack vulnerable groups have doubled their number of followers, to more than 100,000 participants since February, according to a review by POLITICO of those accounts.

The themes of far-right posts include long-standing grievances, including allegations that migrants spread disease, support for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall, antagonism toward the EU or opposition to gun control. One online rumor, accusing Microsoft founder Bill Gates of creating the coronavirus, echoes centuries-old conspiracy theories and Anti-Semitic tropes about global elites pulling the world’s strings.

“These aren’t new lines they are spinning,” said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. “They will use anything they can, whether it’s coronavirus or something else, to bring people into their radical world.”

Public figures helping stoke the fires include French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, whose Facebook account has more than 1.5 million followers, and Trump, who has defended his use of the term “Chinese virus” and pushed the theory that the disease may have come from a lab in China, despite pushback from his intelligence and defense agencies.

Extremist groups on the two continents have tried before to coordinate their messaging, with middling success.

After Trump’s surprise victory in 2016, far-right online communities sprouted up across the U.S. and Europe, at first using online platforms like Facebook and Google before shifting their focus to smaller, less-regulated networks to share conspiracy theories or organize protests.

Americans like Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, also tried to export U.S.-style online tactics in hopes of uniting European right-wing groups like Italy’s Northern League party and Le Pen’s National Rally in France, though, as POLITICO reported last year, he struggled to win over movements on the Continent.

Now, as the coronavirus gives the far right a new impetus to find audiences, many European activists are wielding the same U.S.-style tactics they have spent years learning to emulate, including the creation of online “meme banks” of photos designed to spread widely. That leaves them less in need of outside help, according to researchers tracking their movements.

“Europe’s far-right no longer needs additional resources from its transatlantic supporters,” said Chloe Colliver, who heads the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

It does not take much digging through the online platforms to find far-right messages on the health crisis.

In Italy, extremist news outlets have flooded social media with reports blaming that country’s devastating coronavirus outbreak on migrants, including an online attack that singled out a Pakistani employee at a Chinese restaurant in a northern Italian town.

In France, activists called for sending non-white populations back to their “home” countries, while Le Pen, the far-right leader, alleged on Facebook that mosques had have “taken advantage of the confinement orders” by blaring “the muezzin's call to Islamic prayer” on loudspeakers.

Tommy Robinson, the British anti-immigration activist, has promoted the “#GermJihad” hashtag and reposted online messages from members of India’s ruling nationalist BJP party to his more than 36,000 followers on Telegram, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s review of his posts.

Others, on sites like Facebook and Reddit, have alleged that the Chinese created the coronavirus as a bioweapon to attack the U.S. economy, and will reap the windfall if they are not stopped. “China will become even more brazen and take down western economies with more filth in the future,” one Reddit user wrote."

Bill Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said the US government had warned medical research organisations of the risks.

But he would not say whether there had been confirmed cases of stolen data.

UK security sources says they have also seen similar activity.

An international race is on to find a vaccine for Covid-19.

Researchers, companies and governments are all involved. And their efforts are simultaneously being protected by domestic spy agencies, while being targeted by foreign ones.

Mr Evanina's organisation provides advice on countering the work of foreign intelligence agencies to the US government, businesses and academia.

""We have been working with our industry and government folk here very closely to ensure they are protecting all the research and data as best they can,"" he said.

""We have every expectation that foreign intelligence services, to include the Chinese Communist Party, will attempt to obtain what we are making here.""

The US government is trying to aid work on a vaccine with a programme reportedly called Operation Warp Speed.

Whichever country discovers the first effective and safe formulation may be able to ensure its citizens are first to benefit.

""We've been in contact with every medical research organisation that is doing the research to be very, very vigilant,"" Mr Evanina added.

""In today's world there is nothing more valuable or worth stealing than any kind of biomedical research that is going to help with a coronavirus vaccine.""

In mid-April, an FBI official said there had been ""some intrusions"" into institutions working on Covid-related research.

Deputy assistant director Tonya Ugoretz said bio-medical data had long been ""a priority target for cyber-espionage"" and organisations publicly linked to work on the virus had become a ""mark"".

Later in the month, the US assistant attorney general for national security, John Demers, said it would be ""beyond absurd"" to think China would not be interested in such details.
• AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise
• TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?

Canada's Centre for Cyber Security warned in March that ""sophisticated threat actors may attempt to steal the intellectual property of organisations engaged in research and development related to Covid-19.""

US and Western spies are also likely to be interested in what is going on inside China, including any discrepancies over the death toll from Covid-19 as well as its research on vaccines and treatments.

There have also been ongoing concerns about the risks of cyber-attacks against health organisations, which could undermine their ability to respond to the outbreak.

Two hospitals in the Czech Republic reported experiencing cyber-attacks in April. This led to an unusual request from the US Secretary of State.

""We call upon the actor in question to refrain from carrying out disruptive malicious cyber-activity against the Czech Republic's healthcare system or similar infrastructure elsewhere,"" Mike Pompeo said in a statement."
821,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,Governor Ron DeSantis is mentioned as the responsible actor for the state's rushed reopening plan.,True,The article mentions the state's rushed reopening plan following initial lockdowns.,True,The article mentions the surge in new coronavirus cases and the risk of Florida becoming the next large epicenter.,False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Florida on Saturday reported 4,049 new coronavirus cases, another consecutive single-day record increase in cases. The number of statewide infections has surged to at least 93,797.

There have now been over 3,100 deaths in Florida due to COVID-19. The state has tested over 1.5 million people, according to its health department.

While Governor Ron DeSantis has attributed recent spikes to increased access to testing, many experts say the state's rushed reopening plan following initial lockdowns may be to blame. In the nearly two months since DeSantis declared victory against the virus and announced Florida would begin reopening, there has been an explosion of new cases across the state.

DeSantis said in a press conference Saturday that many of the new positive tests are coming from younger, asymptomatic people. He did, however, note that the rate of infection appears to be ""accelerating"" among this group, which he called a ""cause for concern.""

Experts at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania said this week the state has ""all the markings of the next large epicenter."" They singled out Texas, Arizona and the Carolinas as other concerning states with high levels of community spread.

Their report said the risk in Florida ""is the worst it has ever been in our projections.""

All of Florida, except for Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach, is in the second phase of reopening. Bars and restaurants can operate at 50% capacity, and gyms, retail stores, museums, libraries and professional sports venues can operate at full capacity.

Major League Baseball, however, has decided to shut down all spring training facilities in the state. And many businesses have decided to voluntarily close after staff or patrons tested positive.

At a news conference in Miami on Friday, DeSantis said wearing face masks should be voluntary. In the same week, the Keys made mask-wearing mandatory until June 2021, CBS Miami reports.

""This has to be voluntary because the Constitution is not suspended just because there is a virus,"" DeSantis said. ""You do have a right to protest, you have a right to go to religious service, all these other things."""
822,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions several actors, including Donald Trump, William McRaven, Joe Maguire, Jim Mattis, John Kelly, HR McMaster, Sue Gordon, Dan Coats, and Richard Grenell.",True,"The article discusses the actions of Donald Trump, William McRaven, Joe Maguire, and Richard Grenell.",True,The article suggests that Donald Trump's actions could be a threat to national security.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"In a searing op-ed, the former head of US Special Operations Command, who supervised the 2011 Navy Seal raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, has slammed Donald Trump’s reckless attitude towards the intelligence community saying that Americans should be afraid of the president’s actions.

Retired navy admiral William McRaven, writing in The Washington Post about the dismissal of director of national intelligence Joe Maguire, decries the fact that Mr Maguire was apparently ousted simply for doing his job – the dissemination of intelligence to elected officials.

He writes: “As Americans, we should be frightened – deeply afraid for the future of the nation. When good men and women can’t speak the truth, when facts are inconvenient, when integrity and character no longer matter, when presidential ego and self-preservation are more important than national security – then there is nothing left to stop the triumph of evil.”

Admiral McRaven opens with the famous quote from Irish statesman and philosopher Edmund Burke: “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”

He lists the good men and women that have come and gone in the Trump administration: Jim Mattis, John Kelly, HR McMaster, Sue Gordon, Dan Coats, and now Joe Maguire, and later mournfully says that “in this administration, good men and women don’t last long”.

Mr Maguire’s extensive career, including 36 years as a Navy Seal, is described in detail by Admiral McRaven who paints a picture of a patriot and a man of integrity.

When caught up in the Ukraine whistleblower case, Mr Maguire told the White House he would testify if asked and would tell the truth – and he did, says Admiral McRaven.

“He earned the respect of the entire intelligence community. They knew a good man was at the helm. A man they could count on, a man who would back them, a man whose integrity was more important than his future employment.”

Former CIA director John Brennan has also sounded the alarm about the Trump administration’s alleged interference in the operations of US national security. Mr Brennan referred to the dismissal of Mr Maguire as “a virtual decapitation of the intelligence community”.

Mr Maguire has been replaced in an acting capacity by Trump loyalist and US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell – a move widely criticised due to Mr Grenell’s complete lack of experience in the field of intelligence.

The president has said that he will nominate a permanent appointee to the role of director of national intelligence.

The New York Times reports that Mr Grenell has already installed his own leadership team. He has also requested the intelligence behind the classified briefing Mr Maguire gave to the House Intelligence Committee last week, in which he informed lawmakers that Russia is interfering in the 2020 presidential election in Mr Trump’s favour.

When news of the briefing reached Mr Trump, he was reportedly “livid” and complained that Democrats would use it against him. Mr Maguire was dismissed shortly afterwards."

Perhaps luckily for President Obama’s psyche, he doesn’t mix the political and the personal — or, in an alternative reading, he has a coping mechanism that’s ready to be deployed on just such occasions, as he explained during a wide-ranging and serialized interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates for the Atlantic:

“ ‘And so when people criticize or respond negatively to me, usually they’re responding to this character that they’re seeing on TV called Barack Obama, or to the office of the presidency and the White House and what that represents. And so you don’t take it personally. You understand that if people are angry that somehow the government is failing, then they are going to look to the guy who represents government. And that applies, by the way, even to some of the folks who are now Trump supporters. They’re responding to a fictional character named Barack Obama who they see on Fox News or who they hear about through Rush Limbaugh.’ ”

But, still, to be less liked and more disliked than Putin among any subset of the American electorate cannot have been something even this uncommonly deliberative president would have foreseen.

Aside from contextualizing criticism, the president’s discussion with Coates touched on such issues as race and racism in America, the election of Trump (“[s]urprised like everybody else”), his own legacy and more.

824,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions President John Magufuli and opposition leader Freeman Mbowe as actors responsible for the decisions and actions related to COVID-19.,True,The article discusses the actions taken by President John Magufuli and the government of Tanzania regarding the handling of COVID-19.,False,The article does not mention any threats related to COVID-19.,True,The article discusses patterns and observations related to the handling of COVID-19 in different countries.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Recently, Tanzania's President John Magufuli raised eyebrows around the world by stating that his country had ""eliminated the corona disease, thanks to God."" Magufuli has been on the receiving end of particularly harsh criticism since he decided to stop issuing data on the spread of COVID-19 at the end of April. An attack on opposition leader Freeman Mbowe late on Monday, which left him hospitalized, was attributed by his Chadema party to Mbowe's insistence on more transparency in the fight against the virus.

Magufuli has happily taken over the role of the African outlier, shrugging off international criticism. ""You can have a certain sympathy with Tanzania's position,"" Osman Dar, a health expert with the London-based think tank Chatham House told DW. Collecting data in itself is expensive. Dar does not consider the lack of data coming out of Tanzania to be an insurmountable problem as there are enough non-governmental institutions on the ground to pick up the slack.

Magufuli's government, like many others in Africa, has to weigh the benefits of a lockdown against its impact on the economy and access to health services. In the UK alone, Dar explains, it is estimated that about 20% of additional deaths since the beginning of the pandemic can be attributed to people failing to get medical help during the lockdown and have nothing to do with COVID-19. The consequences in countries where access to medical care is already very difficult could prove much more dire.

Convincing people of the seriousness of the pandemic is proving to be another problem. On a continent where, unlike Europe, there is hardly any social protection ""people are likely to ask 'if we have HIV, tuberculosis and malaria killing hundreds of thousands of people and the government doesn't care, why are you suddenly so worried about this coronavirus infection?',"" Dar says. People can see the consequences of the suspension, for example, of vaccination programs against measles and other diseases. This also provides fertile ground for conspiracy theories to take hold.

""In Ghana, the illiteracy rate in Ghana is comparatively high,"" says Courage Kosi Setsoafia Saba, a microbiologist at the University of Development Studies in Tamale. He believes that the data being collated in his country is ""ok."" But, he added, ""depending on the way you come out with figures, there will be a lot of questions.""

Contradictory and precipitate official announcements are one problem. ""When we had around 3,000 cases, government officials announced that we had reached our peak,"" Saba told DW. ""Just a few days after that announcement, we had a surge in cases."". According to figures from Johns Hopkins University, Ghana currently has 10,201 confirmed cases and 43 deaths.

In Tamale, people find it difficult to believe that COVID-19 even exists. The fact that the first ten people who were diagnosed and treated for the disease - and later declared cured - exhibited no apparent symptoms.

This skepticism has had very real consequences: ""Three weeks ago, a lot of people were practicing social distancing,"" the microbiologist says. Now, many people have stopped wearing masks.

But Ghana has actually been a pioneer with regards to introducing a new and effective method of collating relevant data, health expert Dar says. Pooled testing, as it is known, ""is now being tried by other countries too,"" as a means of increase testing capacities. This kind of sampling combines biological specimens from multiple subjects into a testing pool and which is then subjected to a single test. If the result comes back negative, no further tests are required, freeing up capacities.

It's no surprise that countries who are going through political and security crises find it more difficult to react swiftly to the pandemic.

Cameroonians, who are already suspicious of the authorities' motives, are especially sensitive to numbers that don't add up or even contradict themselves. Albert Ze, who has won multiple awards for his research in health economics, does not spare his government criticism for the way it has been handling the pandemic.

""From the start we failed to do what needed to be done to fight the virus,"" he told DW. The measures taken were copied from Europe and did not take into account Cameroon's unique political, social, and health structures - with dire results. Ze also blames the World Health Organization (WHO), for spearheading an overly ""harmonized"" global response to the pandemic.

So far, Cameroon has officially registered 8,631 cases and 212 deaths. But Ze believes that the data presented by the government is not credible at all. Most of the numbers are out-dated and don't reflect the current situation at any given time. This is mainly due to the centralization of the whole testing process in only one institution. The government has only now started to make an effort to decentralize testing. While he is aware of a number of ""mistakes by the state,"" Albert Ze does not see any sinister motives behind the official action.

He does criticize the fact that Cameroon has three institutions publishing contradictory data. ""As result there is no credible information available for the population.""

In times of crisis, credible information is crucial for developing working strategies, he said. ""Many people do not believe in the existence of a virus anymore. Others think the danger is over because the government lifted some restrictions.""

Ze believes there has to be an effort by the government to educate the population on the need to comply with the measures for containing the spread of the virus. Ghanaian health expert Courage Kosi Setsoafia Saba calls on ""evidence-based education"" of the population by the government."" Even though there is a stigma attached to the illness, ""those who have recovered should speak out about their experience,"" he said."

But when a not-for-profit recently exposed Jones’ most offensive viral content in a compilation on YouTube, the site was much less supportive – instead deleting the footage from the platform, accusing it of “harassment and bullying”.

Media Matters, a leftwing watchdog, last week posted a series of clips of Jones spreading falsehoods about the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, a newsworthy video of evidence after the victims’ families filed a defamation lawsuit against the Infowars host. But YouTube, for reasons it has yet to explain, removed the video three days after it was published, a move that once again benefitted Jones, who is now arguing that the defamation suit has defamed him.

The video was censored for several days, but reinstated Monday after the Guardian’s inquiry and backlash on social media. Still, the case offered yet another stark illustration of the way tech companies and social media algorithms have failed to distinguish between fake news and legitimate content – while continuing to provide a powerful platform to the most repugnant views and dangerous propaganda.

“This just shows the capriciousness and arbitrariness by which they are enforcing these standards,” said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters.

Jones, who has faced numerous lawsuits accusing him of spreading harmful misinformation, has skyrocketed to international fame by fueling a range of conspiracy theories that suggest high-profile mass shootings in America may have been “false flags” or hoaxes, in which the government and “crisis actors” staged the tragedies to push new gun laws.

YouTube, which is owned by Google, has been instrumental in promoting Jones’ channel to new followers, helping him garner millions of views to false news that has had devastating real-world consequences.

Shooting victims’ families and survivors have faced widespread abuse and harassment, with some conspiracy theorists facing arrest and prison for their death threats and attacks. One fake news story about Hillary Clinton, widely promoted by Jones and Infowars, led to a shooting in a Washington DC restaurant.

Media Matters’ seven-minute video – titled “What Alex Jones said about the Sandy Hook shooting” – offered examples of the host sharing blatantly false information, calling the massacre that killed 20 children an “inside job” and “completely fake”, one time saying, “it just pretty much didn’t happen.”

Those quotes are critical now that Jones, in the face of litigation, is alleging that the families’ lawsuit has accused him of making statements he never actually said.

“There was an actual news component to this,” said Carusone, noting that the high-profile student activists from Parkland, Florida had also been sharing the video.

YouTube told Media Matters the video was “flagged for review” and that the company determined it violated “harassment and bullying” policies. Media Matters also received a “strike”, a preliminary penalty that can lead to an account being altogether shut down.

YouTube declined to answer questions about the video and has not explained whether Jones or his associates flagged the video or if the company considered the rightwing commentator to be a harassment victim.

After Media Matters wrote about the censorship and the Guardian inquired, YouTube reinstated the video. A spokesperson said in an email: “With the massive volume of videos on our site, sometimes we make the wrong call. When it’s brought to our attention that a video or channel has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it.”

Media Matters noted that dozens of Sandy Hook videos were still permitted on Jones’ YouTube page, including some the watchdog had used in the compilation. Videos labeled “Crisis Actors Used at Sandy Hook!”, “Sandy Hook was a Total False Flag!” and “Retired FBI Agent Investigates Sandy Hook: MEGA MASSIVE COVER UP” all remained live on Jones’ channel on Monday.

Jones videos have had a long-term impact, Carusone noted. “Years later, parents of these students are still receiving attacks and threats.”

The incident has also served as a reminder that tech companies like Google and Facebook have, in the face of pressure from conservatives, worked to show they are unbiased, Carusone said.

“They are extraordinarily sensitive to their rightwing critics.”"

A “SUPREME” COURT? I CAN DO BETTER

 by Ted Nugent

It is glaringly obvious that a critical lesson in history 101 is due in America, for it appears that not only does a lunatic fringe of anti-freedom Americans dismiss our founding fathers’ clear declaration of independence and succinct enumeration of our God-given individual rights, but some Americans have the arrogance and audacity to question whether the right to self-defense is indeed one of these individual rights. Dear God in heaven, who could be this soulless? How about 4 out of the 9 so called “Supreme” justices of the land. God help us all.

Who could be so asinine as to believe that a free man has no such right to keep and bear arms for self-defense? What kind of low-life scoundrel would know that courageous heroes of the U.S. Military would volunteer over and over again to sacrifice and die for such self-evident truths, then turn around and spit on their graves by discounting the very freedoms that these brave men and women have died to protect?

Will these supreme legal scholars also affirm an individual right to choose the religion of our individual choice? Do they authorize our individual freedom of speech? Can you imagine? Them is fighting words my friends, and the line drawn in the sand has never been more outrageous.

Recent USA Today and Gallup polls showed a whopping 73% of good Americans know damn well that we are all created equal, and that we each have an individual right to protect our life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. What kind of jackass doesn’t know this? Allow the guitar player to translate for the soul-dead among us.

Keep — this means the gun is mine and you can’t have it. This does not mean I will register it with a government agency. The government works for “we the people,” not the other way around, regardless of what Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Hitler, Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein or Barack Hussein Obama or 4 supreme justices may try to tell you.

Bear — this means I’ve got it right here, on me, either in my grasp or damn near. This does not mean locked away in a safe, trigger-locked or stored at the local sporting club.

Shall not be infringed — this of course is another way of saying Don’t tread on me, for we will not be your willing crime victims, subjects, servants or slaves, so don’t even think about it.

When the evil King’s gangsters came to collect unfair taxes from Americans, we tossed their tea into the drink. When they came to disarm us into helplessness against their old world tyrannical ways, we met them at Concord Bridge and shot them dead till they quit treading on us. Any questions children? I didn’t think so.

Corrupt men cannot be trusted, hence the right of “the people” to choose the individual church of our choice, to speak our individual ideas and beliefs, to have individual freedom from unwarranted searches and seizures, and ultimately, to exercise our individual right to keep and bear arms so that evildoers cannot do unto us that which we would not do unto them. Get it? I would love to meet the human being who would argue these points with us. We would be looking at a fascist, and of course fascists, by all historical and empirical evidence, must be eliminated.

If you value the American Way, if you believe in the words and spirit of the US Constitution and our sacred Bill of Rights, if you know in your heart that you have the right, the duty, the spiritual obligation to protect yourself and your loved ones from evil in all of its forms, then you had best contact each and every one of your elected officials right away and let them know that you know exactly what the Second Amendment says and stands for. Remind them about the “shall not be infringed” clause.

It will not be the fault of the rotten anti-Americans out there who don’t believe in individual rights that rape and pillage our Constitution, it will be the fault of those who know better but failed to speak up. Now is the time to fortify America, and we better inform the Supreme Court just who truly is the “Supreme” Court of America-We the people. Individual people with individual, God given rights. The real America. Live free or die."

Rather, it was Trump's most vocal and controversial online supporters themselves, the far-right mediasphere that rallied behind his candidacy.

While traditional conservative analysts and outlets applauded the decision to strike after Syria President Bashar Assad's chemical attack on his own people earlier this week, the reaction was radically different among supporters online.

Paul Joseph Watson, a vlogger at the conspiracy-peddling blog InfoWars, announced the end of his support for the president, vowing to support far-right French presidential candidate Marie Le Pen.

Banned from Twitter, ousted Breitbart provocateur Milo Yiannopoulous spent much of Thursday railing against Trump's decision on Facebook.



Right-wing pseudo-journalist Chuck Johnson took to Facebook to criticize American intervention in Syria.

""I will spend every minute of 2020 working to defeat Trump if we invade Syria,"" Johnson promised.

They were far from alone.

Ann Coulter declared that Trump was destroying his own presidency while Lauren Southern — a Canadian alt-right personality known for highly controversial stunts like faking a gender transition and confronting progressive protesters — live-streamed herself drinking wine and blasting ""neo-cons"" like senior adviser Jared Kushner and Sen. John McCain.

""We're going to war — isn't this fun, guys? Isn't this great?"" she rhetorically asked. ""I don't get this. Literally no one wants to do this.""



Others floated conspiracy theories about the nature of the strike.

""New Right"" personality Mike Cernovich urged his almost 250,000 Twitter followers to call the White House, demanding a stop to the strike, and floated a number of conspiracy theories.



Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also perpetuated the conspiratorial false-flag narrative, declaring that the strike could plunge the US into World War III.



Other figures appeared more unsure or telegraphed their disapproval.

Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft and Michael Flynn Jr., former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's outspoken son, both spent the evening retweeting posts disapproving of the strike. A source inside Breitbart told Business Insider that the far-right publication's staffers were split over the decision to strike.

The split between hawkish Trump supporters paraded on outlets like Fox News and antipathy to the strike online reflected the president's own flip-flops on interventionism during the campaign.

While he occasionally threatened to ""bomb the s---"" out of foes like ISIS, he proposed working with Russia and Assad to fight ISIS, and expressed suspicion about Syrian rebels.

""I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS,"" Trump said during the second presidential debate.

The split further harkened back to the pre-Trump roots of the alternate online conservative movement.

Many figures like Jones and white nationalist Richard Spencer expressed interest in Ron Paul's 2008 candidacy, partially citing his anti-interventionist ideology.

Some right-wing figures pleaded for unity among Trump supporters online.

In a live stream, Tim Treadstone, better known as the occasionally anti-Semitic Twitter personality Baked Alaska, attempted to spin division between Trump supporters as a critique of ""zombie"" leftists.

""I personally am against the airstrikes and I think Trump made a bad decision, but we need to listen to each other right now and not go against each other,"" Treadstone said."

The former president let loose during campaign stops Friday in Milwaukee and Detroit, where he encouraged Democrats to get out and vote in the midterms and warned that the “character of our country is on the ballot” in the upcoming November 6th elections.

Although he did not mention Trump by name, Obama unleashed some heavy criticism of the current president. Referring to Trump’s relationship with the truth, Obama said, “Throughout human history, certainly throughout American history, politicians have exaggerated. But what we have not seen before in our public life is politicians just blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying. Just making stuff up.”

He then pointed to Trump’s promise to pass a tax cut before the election, despite the fact that Congress will not be in session again until after the midterms.

Obama also accused the Republican party of drumming up crises before elections, including their disingenuous concern about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails, referring a New York Times report that Trump uses an unsecured iPhone, despite Secret Service requests he switch to a more secure device, and once left the phone in a golf cart. (The president denied the report in a tweet sent from an iPhone.)

“In the last election, it was Hillary’s emails. ‘This is terrible’ … ‘This is a national security crisis,'” he said. “They didn’t care about emails and you know how you know? Because if they did, they’d be up in arms right now that the Chinese are listening to the president’s iPhone that he leaves in his golf cart. Turns out, I guess it wasn’t that important.”

Talking about recent calls by Republicans for a return to civility, Obama called their bluff: “I’m hoping you think it’s wrong to hear people spend years, months, vilifying people, questioning their patriotism, calling them enemies of the people. And then suddenly you’re concerned about civility. Please.”

The former president also mocked Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” of corruption in Washington. He said that Trump has “gone to Washington and just plundered away,” adding that, “In Washington they have racked up enough indictments to field a football team. Nobody in my administration got indicted. So, how is it that they cleaned things up?”

But in Detroit, Obama ended his speech on an optimistic note. “I’m hopeful, Michigan,” he said. “I’m hopeful that despite all the noise, despite all the lies, we’re going to come through all that. We’re going to remember who we are, who we’re called to be. I’m hopeful because out of this political darkness, I’m seeing a great awakening.”"
829,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,Bill Gates is mentioned as the source of information and as someone involved in fighting coronavirus.,True,The article discusses the actions of states reopening and the need for diagnostic testing and contact tracing.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"New York (CNN Business) The ability for parts of the United States to safely and effectively begin to lift coronavirus restrictions will depend on the country's capacity to aggressively test for and trace new cases of the virus, Bill Gates told CNN's Fareed Zakaria Sunday.

His comments come as several US states prepare to ease social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions this week, despite warnings from health researchers that no state should reopen before May 1. Meanwhile, the total number of reported coronavirus cases in the United States is nearing 1 million, and more than 54,000 Americans have died.

Gates, thefounder whose foundation has studied pandemics for years and is now involved in fighting coronavirus , warned that just because some areas looking to reopen have experienced relatively small outbreaks doesn't mean they're not at risk.

Many are concerned that reopening too soon could prompt a second wave of infections in the United States as deadly as the first. States must weigh that risk against trying to recover from the economic crisis that's been caused by coronavirus-related shut downs.

""If they open up, they can go back into exponential (coronavirus infection) growth and compete with New York on that basis,"" Gates said, adding that areas that reopen and allow people to move around could also seed infections in other parts of the country, further slowing the recovery from the pandemic.

Successful reopenings will happen in stages, Gates said, guidance that's in line with recommendations from many health experts and economists , including the World Health Organization . And will require thinking critically about which elements of society are most essential to get back to work, implementing safety measures as they are reopened and ensuring diagnostic testing and contact tracing are in place to understand the effects that easing restrictions has on the spread of the virus.

""What we don't know is, (if) we go slightly back to normal, which activities create the risk of a rebound?"" Gates said. ""We need to put in place a very dense testing regime so you would detect that rebound going back into exponential growth very quickly and not wait for the ICUs to fill up and there to be a lot of deaths. If you see the hot spot, you kind of understand the activities causing that.""

In two suggested plans for reopening the US economy, public health experts and economists said that the country would have to perform millions of diagnostic tests each week before restrictions could be safely lifted.

Gates said Sunday that new testing machines and methods should soon be able to get the United States up to between 400,000 and 500,000 tests per day, though that's ""just barely enough for really doing the tracking.""

As the country ramps up testing and tracking, cities and states must have a staged reopening of various parts of the economy, Gates said, though he admitted ""we're a little naive about how to prioritize these activities.""

Gates said that when planning for staged reopenings, states should focus on ""high value"" segments of the economy such as schools, manufacturing and construction, and should figure out how to operate those things with masks and social distancing.

Tragically, Lavoisier survived this flirtation with danger only to lose his head to the guillotine in revolutionary Paris on trumped-up charges of false accounting. Over the following centuries, oxygen, named for its 'acid-forming' powers, has become an element widely cherished for its life-supporting properties. We tend to see oxygen in a positive light, with superstar Michael Jackson allegedly spending his nights in an oxygen tent. Few other elements can claim this level of celebrity endorsement, but the truth is that oxygen is a mixed blessing. Anyone whose life has been marked by fire knows how dangerous it can be, and although we would quickly die without it, growing evidence suggests that oxygen plays a leading part in the ageing process. It is this balance of good and bad that makes oxygen such an interesting molecule.

Nick Lane's enjoyable and informative book would have us believe that “without the threat of oxygen toxicity, life would never have evolved beyond a green slime”. Although we depend on it now, it seems highly likely that life first arose in the absence of free oxygen. Oxygen strips organic molecules of electrons and the earliest replicating biopolymers would have been defenceless against its attack. Thus, life began anaerobically and it was during the quiet aeons of early biological evolution that the first photosynthesizing bacteria began to secrete oxygen as a 'toxic' metabolic waste. Not for the last time, the planet's dominant life form made a mess of the environment. This environmental stress imposed a strong selection pressure and there emerged organisms that not only could withstand oxygen toxicity, but which found in this pollutant the source of a new energy supply. Oxidative phosphorylation was entrained in the service of a new breed of life, and, in time, we came along.

In the first half of the book, Lane reviews in some detail the evidence for this role of oxygen in the evolution of life. Although he endorses the major elements of the conventional tale, he prefers a plot line that is relatively new. Instead of a primordial atmosphere made up mainly of methane, ammonia and hydrogen, Lane subscribes to the idea that 4 billion years ago the Earth's atmosphere consisted mostly of nitrogen, as today, with some carbon dioxide and water vapour, and traces of other gases including oxygen. The common view — and mine before reading this book — is that the impressive armoury of defences against oxygen toxicity in present-day organisms evolved to counter the growing danger as free oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. The alternative, favoured by Lane, is that oxidative stress was known long before free oxygen became a hazard. A significant source of oxidative stress comes from the actions of ultraviolet radiation on water molecules. If life established an early presence in the radiation-exposed ocean surface, where water-splitting photosynthesis might most feasibly have evolved, cells must quickly have acquired potent antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase. So by the time atmospheric oxygen became a threat, the antioxidant defences were already partly in place.

Ultraviolet-induced oxidative stress remains a potent source of free radicals today, attacking any cell exposed to sunlight. Such stress is thought, for example, to play a part in age-related macular degeneration, one of the most important causes of visual impairment in older people. This brings us to the second half of Lane's book, which is about oxygen's role in killing us. It is a pity that this substantial aspect of the book is not hinted at by the sub-title, because Oxygen presents an entertaining and cogent account of how oxidative stress fits into our rapidly expanding knowledge about ageing. Lane also describes work on degenerative conditions such as dementia, and explains with admirable clarity how an imbalance in the antioxidant defence system in people with Down's syndrome, who have an extra copy of the gene for superoxide dismutase, the enzyme which tackles the dangerous superoxide radical but makes harmful hydrogen peroxide in the process, contributes to an increased risk of Alzheimer-like symptoms.

The one shortcoming of the book, perhaps inevitable given its title, is that Lane pushes one molecular player into the limelight, to the exclusion of others, more than is right. The argument that oxygen is the molecule that made the world is hard to swallow, and oxidative stress is not the only agent that makes us age. Nevertheless, Lane presents a nicely crafted account of an important element's place in our lives. His book deserves to be read widely even if, in time, it must share space on the bookshelf with equivalent books on carbon, nitrogen, iron, and the rest."

Yes, some of the things we relish during the summer months make for potent and potentially dangerous levels of air pollution.

That’s because pollution isn’t a single thing. It’s a mixture of gasses and particles in the air, some of which are affected by weather conditions and human activities more so at this time of year.

Particulate matter can include dust, ash, and other byproducts of combustion — like what’s coming out of your car’s tailpipe.

Yes — but it depends on where it is.

Ozone pollution in particular becomes more problematic during the summer as days get hotter and sunnier. The production of ozone increases with higher temperatures. Other meteorological conditions including wind can also affect ozone pollution.

“The ozone protects the earth when it is in the stratosphere — very, very high above the sky in the stratosphere, where the ozone serves as a layer to absorb UV light and protect the earth from UV radiation. At the ground level, ozone has human health impacts,” Yifang Zhu, PhD, a professor in the environmental health sciences department at UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, told Healthline.

Ground level or “tropospheric” ozone is actually the main ingredient in what makes up smog.

Zhu explained that there’s a saying in the environmental health field: “Good ozone up high, bad ozone nearby.”

Not only do hot days affect ozone pollution levels, but the heat itself can also be cause for worry, particularly on smoggy days.

“There is emerging evidence showing the synergy and linkage between heat and pollution. When the temperature is high, the pollutant level could also be high,” said Zhu.

Both high pollution levels and higher ambient heat temperatures have been linked with in susceptible populations, such as older adults. Together, researchers theorize that pollution and high temperatures may have a synergistic effect that’s more harmful.

The question many researchers are now asking is how global warming may play a role in the relationship between ambient temperatures and pollution levels.

Other causes of summer haze

But summer pollution problems aren’t solely related to warmer weather. Human activity has plenty of impact.

If you had a big blowout on the Fourth of July, you likely contributed heavily to air pollution.

According to a story by the Los Angeles Times, July 4th pollution is consistently some of the worst of the year, with levels of particulate matter well above safe exposure levels.

It’s not just Los Angeles either, they found that fine-particulate pollution on July 4th and 5th is on average 42 percent higher than the rest of the year.

Small particles caused by fires “are the particles that can travel fairly long distances across continents. You can expect a fairly large regional impact when there is a fire somewhere in California,” said Zhu.

The best way to stay healthy during the summer months is to stay informed.

There are plenty of online resources, such as AirNow, a service of the EPA, which gives real-time updates on air quality and pollution.

Pollution masks can also be helpful but, Zhu warns, many of them give only “minimum protection.” Pollution masks must receive a special rating of , meaning they filter 95 percent or 99 percent of particulate matter, to be effective against pollution.

Air pollutants in the United States have an accepted level of safety set by the Environmental Protection Agency. When the amount of a certain gas or particulate rises above that threshold, it’s known to have adverse health effects on humans.

The acute health effects of heavy pollution days are unlikely to be severe in healthy individuals but can include:
• increased stress on the heart and lungs

Chronic health problems related to heavy pollution include increased risk of death, cardiovascular issues including asthma and bronchitis, and decreased lung functioning.

Susceptible populations such as children, the elderly, and those with preexisting cardiovascular conditions, should be mindful of heavy pollution days, particularly if it’s hot out.

“The best thing to do is avoid outdoor activities and exercise when the pollutant concentration is high outside,” said Zhu."

Bush after the latter does a coronavirus video

WASHINGTON – Former President George W. Bush released a video this weekend encouraging Americans to stand up to the coronavirus pandemic, and did not mention President Donald Trump.

It doesn't sound as if that sat too well with Trump.

""He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!"" Trump said in a series of tweets Sunday in which he otherwise echoed praise of his performance on the virus and other issues.

Trump's criticism of Bush dealt with the latter's silence during the impeachment investigation and trial. But he quoted a Fox News commentator who was talking about the coronavirus video Bush made.

Pete Hegseth of Fox said he appreciated Bush's video but wondered why the former president didn't urge people to put partisanship aside during the impeachment drama.

In his video, Bush praised health care workers and other Americans who are meeting a historic ""shared threat.""

""In the final analysis, we are not partisan combatants,"" Bush said. ""We are human beings, equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God. We rise or fall together, and we are determined to rise.""

Bush's message of unity won widespread praise and drew comparisons to Trump.

""In the face of a crisis that requires leadership, empathy, and trust in science, Trump has come up short,"" tweeted former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. ""Bush’s video should remind Republicans that they can do better.""

Other critics noted that Trump wrote ""bye the way,"" when he meant to say ""by the way.""

Trump and Bush have made no secret of their disdain for each other.

Bush said he did not appreciate Trump's attacks on him, his brother, and his father during the 2016 Republican primaries, as the New York businessman defeated a field of opponents that included former Florida Gov. Jeb. Bush.

After Trump was sworn in as president, the Bush team let it be known that he found the new president's inaugural address – including a reference to an ""American carnage"" – to be ""some weird s---.""

Trump, meanwhile, claims his predecessors, plural, left him messes that created problems.

Asked recently if he planned to speak with living presidents about how to deal with the pandemic, Trump said no.

""So I don't want to disturb them, bother them,"" Trump said. ""I don't think I'm going to learn much. I guess you could say that there's probably a natural inclination not to call."""

American censors took exception to parts of the film, specifically scenes featuring sodomy between Saddam Hussein and Satan. Consequently, the film was substantially cut, and was given an R certificate, meaning those under the age of 17 have to be accompanied by an adult.

A Christian website, crosstalk.com, describes the film as “intentionally immoral, with the most vile content in the history of mainstream movie-making; 340 counted obscenities… 14 profanities and many disgusting bodily functions, including vomiting, bloody violence… extreme sex including homosexuality and paedophilia… this is a blasphemous, evil movie. EVIL.”

In the UK, the film has been granted a 15 certificate, allowing anyone over that age to see it unaccompanied, and not a frame was chopped.

A spokesman for the BBFC explained: “You can’t really generalise, but the Americans are very strict about sexual material above all else. We didn’t have a problem with anything in the film.”

Ironically, the film’s full title is South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut and pokes fun at the hypocrisy of most censorship regarding war, violence and sex.

Trey Parker, who together with Matt Stone create South Park, hit out at the current “climate of fear” in the wake of the Columbine massacre and the hypocrisy of the US censors, he declared: “It’s just scary – going through the trailer process and getting the notes back (from the censors) that say, ‘You just can’t fart.’ It’s like, the shot of the guy shooting the M60 and all these people getting shot – that was OK. But the guy farting has to go.”

The movie is released in the UK on August 27."

The armed North Carolina man who traveled to a Washington D.C. pizzeria this weekend while self-investigating an wild internet conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton surrendered to authorities when his search yielded no evidence, according to court documents released Monday.

Edgar Welch, 28, was arraigned Monday on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license and other crimes, the documents say.

The documents allege that Welch, whose address is listed 250 miles south, in Durham, N.C., arrived at the pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, armed with an AR-15 rifle and a .38 caliber handgun just after 3 p.m. to help “rescue” child sex slaves that he believed were possibly being held there.

At the pizzeria on Sunday, a worker told police that he was outside when Welch apparently arrived. Identified only as CW-1 in the documents, the worker said that he stepped out to grab pizza dough when he heard three loud bangs coming from inside.

“CW-1 re-entered the restaurant and observed a white male holding an AR-15 type rifle,” the documents say, adding that when Welch allegedly swung the rifle towards him he immediately ran outside.

There, another person who had been in Comet was shouting: “He’s in there and he has a gun,” the documents say.

No one was injured in the incident, and by 3:15 p.m., a police barricade had been set up outside of Comet. Nine minutes after that, Welch set his guns down and walked outside with his hands raised, the documents say.

When a sergeant asked about motive, Welch “stated that he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that the wanted to see for himself if they were there,"" according to the documents.

The documents say that Welch then “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.”

On Sunday, Alefantis offered up Welch's actions as the logical but grim conclusion of fake news, telling reporters: ""What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theory does come with consequences.""

The roots of the so-called “PizzaGate” fake conspiracy theory can be traced to the email hacking of Hillary Clinton’s former presidential campaign chair, John Podesta, the New York Times reported last month.

Podesta casually knows the restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, the Times reported, and an email between the two about a fundraiser became the source of rampant, unfounded speculation among users of the message board 4Chan, who believed that high-level Democrats were operating a child abuse ring there.

Even though there was no evidence to support those claims, which Alefantis has emphatically denied, the theory was peddled on Reddit, Facebook and elsewhere."

Richard Pan, Karen Kain, and Robert Kennedy Jr. as actors in the discussion about vaccinations.",True,"The article discusses the action of advancing a bill that would require schoolchildren to be vaccinated, as well as the action of parents sending unvaccinated children to school with waivers.",False,The article does not discuss any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not discuss any secrecy.,"California lawmakers on Wednesday advanced a bill that would require schoolchildren in the state to be vaccinated, amid impassioned pleas from doctors and parents, including the activist Robert Kennedy Jr.

Under the proposal, parents would no longer be able to send unvaccinated children to school with waivers for religious or personal beliefs. Exemptions would be available only for children with health problems.

Supporters say the measure would increase the number of vaccinated young people and improve public health.

Ariel Loop told lawmakers that such a plan could have prevented her child from contracting measles at Disneyland, in an outbreak that began there in December. ""My infant shouldn't have had to suffer,"" she said. ""He shouldn't, still months later, be having complications with his eyes. I shouldn't have had to fear for his life.""

Opponents, however, claim that vaccines can be dangerous and that the bill would trample parental rights. Karen Kain said her daughter died of injuries from a mercury-tainted vaccine. ""I stand here today before you to share my story so you can all see and hear what happens when vaccines go wrong,"" she said. ""Who gets to make the choice now of whose babies are more important? Because there is risk, there must be choice.""

The measure, SB-277 from Sen. Richard Pan, was in the earliest stages of the legislative process. Still, it drew large crowds, including parents who brought their children. During the emotionally charged hearing, one opponent threatened to put a curse on lawmakers who voted for the bill, and another woman was removed after an outburst.

The bill passed out of the Senate Health Committee on a 6-2 vote Wednesday.

""I've personally witnessed the suffering caused by vaccine-preventable diseases, and all children deserve to be safe at school,"" said Pan, who is also a pediatrician, in a press release. “The personal belief exemption is now putting other schoolchildren and people in our community in danger.”

If the bill is passed by the legislature and is signed by the governor, California would join Mississippi and West Virginia as the only states with such strict vaccine rules. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, California is among 20 states that allow for exemptions on the basis of personal belief. Forty-eight states allow religious exemptions.

Efforts in other states to end personal belief exemptions were proposed after the Disneyland outbreak, which sickened more than 100 people in the U.S. and Mexico. In Oregon and Washington, such proposals were recently rejected.

Opponents include Robert Kennedy Jr., a nephew of President John F. Kennedy and a son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

Robert Kennedy Jr. has been promoting the film ""Trace Amounts"" and is the editor of the book ""Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak,"" which links autism to thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative previously common in vaccines. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the chemical has been not been used in routine childhood vaccines since 2001.

At a rally ahead of Wednesday's legislative hearing, Kennedy said that he had all six of his children vaccinated but that he remains concerned the pharmaceutical industry profits immensely when governments make vaccines mandatory.

Dean Blumberg, a pediatrician who testified on behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the California Medical Association, said childhood vaccination has been so successful that it's easy to overstate their risks and dismiss the diseases they prevent.

""Unfortunately, there's much misinformation about vaccine safety and effectiveness,"" he said. ""Let me be clear. There is no scientific controversy about vaccine safety and vaccine effectiveness ... This is not open to dispute among mainstream doctors and scientists.""

Public health officials believe an immunization rate of at least 90 percent is critical to minimizing the potential for a disease outbreak. California's kindergartners met that threshold at the start of this school year, according to state statistics: 2 percent were exempted because of their parents' personal beliefs, and an additional half a percent were exempted because of their parents' religion.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after years of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014, the U.S. recorded the most cases it has had in two decades.

There is no specific treatment for measles, and most people recover within several weeks. But in malnourished or otherwise vulnerable children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia."

So it’s a pretty big problem when the body is forced to forget. Reporting this week in the journals Science and Science Immunology, two teams of researchers have found that this is the modus operandi of measles virus. In addition to the disease brought on by the virus itself, measles can induce a kind of immune amnesia, leaving the body more vulnerable to infections it’s encountered before. The findings underscore the urgent need for measles vaccination, which could protect people from more than the virus the treatment directly targets, the researchers say. In recent years, however, anti-vaccination movements have driven rates of vaccination down, prompting the number of measles cases to skyrocket on a global scale. More than 7 million cases and 100,000 deaths were reported in 2017, and numbers have continued to climb, Katrina Kretsinger of the World Health Organization, who was not involved in either study, told Debora MacKenzie at New Scientist.

“When parents say no to getting a measles vaccine, you’re not just taking a risk of your kid getting measles,” study author Michael J. Mina of Harvard Medical School told Denise Grady at The New York Times. “You’re causing them to lose this amazing resource of defenses they’ve built up over the years before measles, and that puts them at risk of catching other infections.” When certain immune cells encounter a pathogen, they’re able to scan its surface and memorize it, storing away identifying intel that will help mount a stronger, faster response if the invader visits again. Often key to this process are the immune cells that produce antibodies—potent molecules that can neutralize bacteria, viruses, and other threats. In the first study, a team of scientists led by Steve Elledge of Harvard Medical School analyzed blood that had been taken from 77 unvaccinated children in the months before and after a measles outbreak that hit the Netherlands in 2013. After an encounter with measles, 11 to 73% of antibodies that kids had generated against a wide array of viruses and bacteria—including those that cause herpes and pneumonia—disappeared. When the researchers tested another group of 32 children that had been vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella, they found their antibodies intact. Rather than destroying the antibodies directly, measles virus seemed to be targeting the cells that churned them out. Accordingly, the biggest drops occurred in children with the most severe cases of measles, Elledge told Grady. The results of the second study, which analyzed the immune cells of 26 of the same unvaccinated children in the Netherlands, built on these results. Measles, they found, was capable of picking off several types of immune cells—many of which mature over time as young bodies are repeatedly exposed to, and recover from, infection. The onslaught, the researchers wrote, essentially rewound the body’s clock, leaving immune systems in an immature state that looked as though it had been “reset back to infancy,” study author Colin Russell of the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands told MacKenzie. Though researchers have known for years that measles can compromise the immune system, the two new studies are the first to dive into how the virus exerts its effects, which are “pretty devastating,” Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious disease physician and epidemiologist who was not involved in either study, told Lena H.

It’s possible for the immune system to recover from a measles attack, the researchers explain. But the body would probably need to be reexposed to the infections it’s forgotten, either naturally or through vaccination, to rebuild the memory it lost—a process that could take five years, study author Velislava Petrova of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cambridge University told Hannah Devlin at The Guardian. It’s an argument for measles vaccination (which is a package deal when children are given the common measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine), Lighter told Sun. Some members of the population, like those who are immune-compromised, aren’t medically eligible for vaccination—but being surrounded by vaccinated people can still protect them. Perhaps there’s a bit of irony to this: Our bodies must be taught to remember measles to avoid the risk of forgetting other pathogens. When first introduced in the 1960s, measles vaccinations prompted a plunge in infections—from measles, yes, but several other pathogens as well. Now it may finally be clear why: The vaccine, Lighter told Sun, “clearly has protection much greater than we previously recognized.”"

Last month, local Taliban militants prohibited polio vaccines over the United States' use of drone strikes in the region.

When a three-day nationwide effort to administer polio vaccines began this week,health workers and volunteers weren't able to immunize children in North and South Waziristan.

Under this security situation, they ""obviously cannot operate,"" said Mazhar Nisar, the health education adviser in the Pakistani prime minister's polio program. ""We're hoping that the campaign will resume in the near future.""

Throughout the rest of the country, vaccination efforts continued as 180,000 health workers and volunteers fanned throughout communities trying to immunize 34 million children, under the age of 5.

Pakistan remains one of the three countries in the world grappling with polio. The country has had 22 reported cases this year. The other two countries are Afghanistan with 11 cases and Nigeria with 54.

The vaccine is administered orally, and in multiple doses to achieve full immunity.

Pakistan's tribal regions are areas where polio is known to be active, according to disease data.

""In a situation like this, any child who has not been administered for polio vaccine remains at risk,"" Nisar said.

Vaccination points have been set up in the entry and exit points to the tribal areas, he added.

""Our concern is reaching every single child possible,"" said Michael Coleman, a communication specialist for UNICEF and polio. ""Where there are limitations presented, it's a concern.""

To date, Pakistan ""has had real progresses,"" said Coleman. ""People are being reached, we need to be keeping that momentum up.""

This is not the first time that Pakistan's polio campaign has made headlines.

Last year, a Pakistani doctor was linked to a CIA operation to verify Osama bin Laden's whereabouts with a door-to-door vaccination campaign in the town of Abbottabad, where the al Qaeda leader was hiding before he was killed.

The ban on the polio vaccine has drawn criticism.

Nisar pointed out that both Western and Islamic countries have eradicated polio through vaccines.

""There is no reason why Pakistan cannot do it,"" he said. ""This message needs to be disseminated, it needs to be reinforced. This is a campaign which saves the children from permanent disability. There cannot be a reason to deny one's children of this facility."""

“I do think it’s something that happens sooner rather than later,” the economist told MarketWatch during a Monday-afternoon interview.

His comments come as the financial expert has been warning for weeks of an epic downturn of the buck that could signal the end of the hegemony of the greenback as a reserve currency — an event that would ripple through global financial markets.

“In a COVID era everything unfolds at warp speed,” Roach told MarketWatch on Monday. He pointed to the contraction of the U.S. economy from an employment rate that was hovering around a 50-year low at around 3.5% near the start of 2020 to one that shows some 49 million people unemployed since the pandemic took hold in March. He also noted the rapid and unprecedented fiscal and monetary response that has ballooned the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to more than $7.2 trillion from $4 trillion at the start of the year as examples of the celerity at which the currency market could change.

Roach is calling for the dollar to soon decline 35% against its major rivals, citing increases in the nation’s deficit and dwindling savings.

“This massive shift to fiscal stimulus is going to blow out the national savings rates and the current-account deficit,” he told MarketWatch, reiterating comments he has previously made in interviews and in an op-ed that published by Bloomberg News on June 14.

Last week, the U.S. current-account deficit, a measure of the nation’s debt to other countries, slipped 0.1% in the first quarter, falling to $104.2 billion from a revised $104.3 billion in the 2019 fourth quarter. The current account reveals if a country is a net lender or debtor.

Roach said that his recent warnings about the dollar have garnered intense and emotional responses from readers and critics, because he believes that the U.S. is at a particularly sensitive time in history.

He said the racial upheaval — sparked by the death of George Floyd — the pandemic and the intensity of the presidential election have combined to elicit powerful responses from readers that he hasn’t gotten since his days writing financial commentary at Morgan Stanley.

He said during this time you’re going to get “hair-trigger responses” from people.

“We’re at a critical point in the political cycle and the dollar is a relative price, so you’re making a comparison to the United States and other countries and there are just really strong views against the analysts that” call into question U.S. dominance, he explained.

Asked if investors should be fearful of a downturn of the dollar, Roach said that this wouldn’t be the first time the dollar has slumped meaningfully, and that “fear is a question of context.”

Fear may be justified “if they are unprepared and not hedged and have not thought about what some of the options are take advantage,” he said, pointing to the euro as a possible alternative to dollars for currency buyers. In the past, he has said that China’s yuan USDCNY, CNHUSD, may be viewed as increasingly appealing to investors, but that view is contingent on China following through with structural reforms the country is undergoing from a manufacturing-heavy economy to one focused more on services.

One measure of the buck, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, , has been weakening over the past 30 days, down 2.9%, but is up slightly on the year, rising 0.7%, according to FactSet data.

The index measures the buck against a basket of six rival currencies, including the euro EURUSD, , the pound GBPUSD, and the yen USDJPY, .

A weaker dollar has implications for assets and the stock market, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, and S&P 500 index SPX, , with most debts denominated in dollars. In addition, a majority of cross-border financing and international trade are conducted in dollars.

Depending on the weather conditions these can merge into a blanket of high cloud that at times can be dense enough to blot out the sun.

Understanding exactly what this does to the climate is still work in progress, but it’s generally agreed that in these areas where the aircraft are constantly pouring out pollution the contrails make the nights warmer by acting as a blanket and the days cooler by reflecting sunlight back into space. Some studies suggest that over 30 years, these contrails will raise average surface temperature by as much as 1C, a serious magnification of global warming.

The length of the contrails and how long they survive depends how dry the atmosphere is when the exhaust gases from the aircraft are released. They can disappear in seconds, but the more moisture there is in the atmosphere the slower they are to disperse. Sometimes when the air is fairly turbulent the contrails appear to be turned on and off, because there are gaps.

It is these intermittent contrails that have led to a conspiracy theory that they are in fact “chemtrails”. Depending on which internet site you read, they are part of a large-scale experiment to alter the climate, or worse, dose the population in chemicals to keep them docile.

Surveys show that up to 15% of the population think there is something in these claims. This is a small number, but a statistic that is alarming researchers who worry about how much public trust in governments has waned."

The U.S. Digital Service has embedded technology experts throughout federal agencies, and they have been responsible for some of the country's most valuable data.

Throughout the pandemic, the USDS has been aiding the White House coronavirus task force in providing crucial statistics to top officials setting policy.

""Often times, that data is derived from or ever prepared by the U.S. Digital Service,"" USDS Administrator Matt Cutts told CBS News' Major Garrett. ""We've got folks slotted in at all kinds of places from the VA to CMS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.""

Cutts leads a team of software and data specialists who track everything from infection rates to face masks.

""It might be everything from figuring out how we can enable remote work… to trying to help with procurement,"" he said, adding that one USDS worker who was at the CDC during the Ebola crisis was currently working on data to help understand hospital bed capacity before the pandemic's peak.

The agency was founded as a solution to the Obamacare website's repeat system crashes. Though President Trump has taken issue with many things his predecessor put into action, his administration has been leaning heavily on the program.

""I view us as nonpartisan,"" Cutts said. ""And our mission is pretty simple: try to do the most good for the most people who need it the most — and we're bringing technology to bear to help that happen.""

Cutts had been one of Google's first 100 employees before joining USDS for a three-to-six month stint, and wound up staying for four years. He now recruits fellow engineers and data scientists from the digital world's best companies.

""We all need to make the federal government work well,"" he said.

The USDS is working on modernizing medicare systems that are running on a mainframe that was 40 years old, and are currently being stressed by a surge of users amid the pandemic.

""There's something like 14 million lines of COBOL involved in that,"" Cutts said, referring to the programming language. ""We have an issue where COBOL programmers aren't just retiring, some of them are dying.""

Antiquated computing systems are not uncommon in the federal government — according to Cutts, ""there are systems that are 20, 30, 40 years old.""

With much of the USDS working remotely, the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need to modernize the government and the program is needed now more than ever.

""There is a lot for technologists to do in government right now,"" Cutts said."

Conspiracy videos abound on YouTube, whether it's about the Earth being flat or school shootings being staged. YouTube, its parent Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) are all facing challenges with the spread of misinformation, propaganda and fake news.

YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said at a conference Tuesday the company will include links to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia to try to debunk videos espousing conspiracy theories.

But Wikipedia itself has had its share of credibility issues, as the service lets anyone edit its content, whether that person is a pedigreed expert or an online troll. Though Wikipedia has tried to address that -- in part by restricting edits on high-profile or controversial pages -- it isn't immune from hoaxes and its own conspiracy theories.

In a statement Wednesday, YouTube said the links will include other ""third-party sources"" besides Wikipedia, though YouTube isn't identifying any. The organization that runs Wikipedia said Wednesday that it had no formal partnership with YouTube, but it welcomed the use of Wikipedia resources.

YouTube said the move is part of a broader initiative to crack down on misinformation, though it didn't give details on what else is in the works.

While conspiracy videos are nothing new on YouTube, the topic received renewed attention in recent weeks as videos falsely claimed that students speaking out about the Feb. 14 Florida school shooting, which killed 17 people, were ""crisis actors"" who were not really there when it happened.

One such conspiracy video was the top-trending video on YouTube until the company removed it -- although many similar videos remained up, illustrating the difficulty in instituting any sort of crackdown.

Conspiracy videos, to be sure, don't violate YouTube's policies. In the ""crisis actor"" case, the company said it removed the video because it violated its rules against harassment. Therefore, YouTube is unlikely to ban misinformation entirely. Instead, it may adopt Facebook's tactic of deemphasizing such content and making it less likely to be seen. As it stands, critics say YouTube is doing the opposite.

""What keeps people glued to YouTube? Its algorithm seems to have concluded that people are drawn to content that is more extreme than what they started with -- or to incendiary content in general,"" Zeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote in a recent New York Times essay.

Tufekci said as users click through video after video, excited by ""uncovering more secrets and deeper truths,"" YouTube leads us down ""a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales."""

Speaking to the CogX conference in London on Monday, Kerry slammed Trump's ""reckless"" response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and said the U.S. had failed to show international leadership through the crisis.

""The odds were against us in the beginning because you had China, which is always somewhat secretive and which clearly began to manage the news in the beginning, and you had the United States with a leader who has no ability to tell the truth, or face it, or to lead,"" he said.

Kerry served as Secretary of State under President Barack Obama from 2013 until 2017. He was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, and he is a surrogate for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign this year.

""The President's early and decisive action to slow the spread of the coronavirus prevented about 60 million infections in the United States and saved up to two million American lives,"" Sarah Matthews, special assistant to the president and deputy press secretary at the White House, told CNBC via email. ""This administration will continue our science-based approach as we continue to safely reopen our economy.""

The new strain of coronavirus has infected almost 2 million people in the U.S. and killed more than 112,000 across the country.

A study published on Monday by the University of California at Berkeley claimed that shutdown orders over the last two months helped to prevent almost 5 million additional U.S. coronavirus cases.

However, Kerry told delegates at the event on Monday that poor leadership in China and the U.S., as well as Trump's attacks on the WHO, ""significantly"" delayed the type of global response the pandemic had warranted, adding that there had also been a failure among world leaders in the handling of the crisis.

""Any leader could have stood up within the G-20 and said 'we're the most developed nations, we have the biggest resources, we're going to be the most impacted because of the way we live, therefore we've got to move.' And that didn't happen,"" he said.

However, Kerry acknowledged that there are ""some things that only the United States can do,"" recalling the Obama administration's response to the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014.

""I will never forget sitting in the situation room being told that 1 million people were going to die over four months if something didn't happen,"" he said.

""President Obama immediately deployed 4,000 troops to West Africa. We didn't know what we didn't know, but we knew we had to summon a global response. So in the end with Ebola, 11,000 people died — 11,000 too many, it's a tragedy, but it's not a million.""

Trump, on the other hand, had handled the current health crisis ""cavalierly"" and ""recklessly,"" Kerry claimed.

""President Obama put together a playbook for any administration that followed us — it happened to be the Trump administration — and they threw it away, they ignored it,"" he said. ""This was a denial of science. It was a denial of experts. It was a denial of facts and evidence by procrastinators, by deniers, by people who want to live with an alternative reality.""

Under Trump's leadership, Kerry said, the U.S. had surrendered its power to lead other nations on the values and principles that had been in place since the end of World War II.

""The United States has obviously been very hurt in the last few years with respect to that leadership, and it hasn't been present,"" he said. ""The United States has reneged on its role as leader of the free world and today, frankly, there is no leader of the free world.""

Trump has slumped in voter polls amid the Covid-19 outbreak, but the president has openly blamed the WHO and China for the spread of the virus, claiming they mishandled the initial outbreak.

The new strain of coronavirus is thought to have originated in a wildlife market, or wet market, in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was first recorded in late December.

China has since faced accusations that it withheld critical information on Covid-19 from the WHO and delayed reporting the new strain of coronavirus to the organization.

Although Chinese leader Xi Jinping has argued the country acted with transparency throughout the crisis, China is resisting complying with a WHO investigation into the global handling of the pandemic.

The Chinese ambassador to the U.K. told Sky News last month that China would allow an investigation into the outbreak — ""but not now."""

• Baba Vanga 2020 prediction: END OF THE WORLD and Putin assassination Nostradamus is believed by many to have predicted the outbreak of World War 3 and some think 2020 could be the year it finally happens. Tensions in the Middle East rose high after US President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on Iran’s Major General Qassem Soleimani on January 3. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei vowed “forceful revenge” in retaliation for the attack, which the US dubbed a countermeasure against future acts of terrorism. Iran retaliated days later with a series of missile attacks on US army bases in Iraq. With the western world and the eastern world clashing, conflict in the Middle East and domestic unrest in China, the world teetered on the brink of chaos. One Nostradamus passage, in particular, could forewarn of a global conflict unfolding next year. The Nostradamus prophecy reads: “Twice put up and twice cast down, the East will also weaken the West. “Its adversary after several battles chased by sea will fail at time of need.”

Based on his own predictions for the next year, Mr Hamilton-Parker said there is a strong possibility a war will break out. However, the psychic foresaw a devastating conflict unfolding in the Middle East, rather than globally, which he said will last from 2020 until 2021. The conflict will involve “riots in Iran” and an all-out war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Off the back of the conflict, Mr Hamilton-Parker said: “Putin and Trump enforce a peace deal.” DON’T MISS

Nostradamus may have a cult following around the world but critics of the 16th-century mystic do not believe he had powers of foresight. Brian Dunning, the author of the Skeptoid podcast, called out people claiming prophecies out of Nostradamus’ cryptic quatrains. He said: “Nostradamus' writings are exploited in a number of fallacious ways. “Ambiguous and wrong translations, ‘creative’ interpretations, hoax writings, fictional accounts, and the breaking of non-existent codes within his quatrains all contribute to a vast body of work, all of it wrong, and many times the size of everything Nostradamus ever actually wrote.” The sceptic added: ""Michel de Nostredame was truly one of the brilliant lights of his day, but to subscribe to false stories and urban legends is to disrespect who the man actually was.

But...""

Donald Trump's Four Favorite Tyrants – and What He Admires Most in Dictators

Most people would be hard-pressed to think of positive things to say about reviled dictators like Saddam Hussein, Benito Mussolini and Kim Jong-un – but for Donald Trump, it’s apparently not a problem.

“He was a bad guy, really bad guy. But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights – they didn’t talk, they were a terrorist, it was over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist, you go to Iraq. It’s like Harvard. Okay? So sad.”

It’s not the first time Trump has expressed admiration for Hussein and other world leaders who have committed atrocities against their own people. In October 2015 the mogul said he believed “100 percent” that Iraq and Libya would be much better off if their respective former dictators Hussein and Moammar Gadhafi were still in power because of their skill at killing terrorists.

“If you look at North Korea, this guy, I mean, he’s like a maniac, okay? And you’ve got to give him credit,” Trump said of Kim Jong-un during a campaign event in Iowa in January. “He goes in, he takes over, and he’s the boss. It’s incredible. He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one.”

And Trump has embraced Putin as a strong leader who he would “get along very well with.” “He’s running his country and at least he’s a leader, unlike what we have in this country,” Trump said. In this case the admiration is mutual. When the Russian strongman complimented Trump as “bright,” “talented” and “an absolute leader in the presidential race,” the billionaire businessman said the praise was “a great honor.”

Trump claimed then that he didn’t know the quote was from Mussolini – but he didn’t seem to care either. “It’s a very good quote,” he said in February. “I didn’t know who said it, but what difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else?”

Asked if he wanted to be associated with Mussolini, Trump replied, “No, I want to be associated with interesting quotes. Hey, it got your attention, didn’t it?”

This week, Trump’s latest comments on Hussein have caught the attention of critics on both sides of the aisle, including Republican lawmakers and members of the GOP’s foreign-policy establishment, reports The Washington Post.

“This follows a disturbing trend of Trump relating to the way brutal tyrants executed policy in their countries. I do think that there’s something dark about Trump’s view of the world,” Republican strategist Tim Miller tells the newspaper.

“When a person running for president continually compliments brutal, undemocratic dictators and their methods, I think it’s fair to have some concerns that those are methods that they might be interested in deploying if necessary,” adds Miller, a former Jeb Bush aide who has played an active role in the anti-Trump movement.

""This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.""The comments were approved by Soros for publication on Friday, a spokesman said.Soros, who earned fame by betting against the pound in 1992, said that with major countries such as Germany selling bonds with a negative yield, perpetual bonds would ease a looming budget crunch across the bloc.He said the EU would have to maintain its 'AAA' credit rating to issue such debt - and thus have to have tax-raising powers to cover the cost of the bonds - so suggested it could simply authorise the taxes rather than imposing them.""There is a solution,"" said Soros. ""The taxes only have to be authorized; they don't need to be implemented.""Asked about Brexit, Soros said he was particularly worried about Italy: ""What would be left of Europe without Italy?""""The relaxation of state aid rules, which favour Germany, has been particularly unfair to Italy, which was already the sick man of Europe and then the hardest hit by COVID-19 ,"" Soros said.Soros fled Hungary when the communists consolidated power in 1947 and ended up at the London School of Economics.

The Green Book states that live vaccines are safe for patients receiving low-dose DMARDs and low dose oral corticosteroids. Those on biologic medications should not receive live vaccines. You should contact us for advice if you are unsure whether a patient should receive a live vaccine.

Specific advice for patients on Rituximab can be found below.

It is a national recommendation that children with a long term illness or who are taking drugs that may cause immunosuppression receive the flu vaccine each year. Current advice is not to give the live nasal spray to patients receiving biologic medication or high-dose corticosteroids.

Prior to commencing immune modifying drugs, children should have their chicken-pox (VZV IgG) status and vaccination history checked. If the patient is not immune to chicken-pox, the chicken-pox vaccine is usually recommended. This should be given at the GP surgery and then a booster given 4 weeks later.

VZV IgG should be checked again at least three weeks after the 2nd vaccine to check vaccine up-take.

If children are not immune to chicken pox and are not able to receive a chicken-pox vaccine, please consider giving the vaccine to non-immune family members or discuss with the paediatric rheumatology team.

Please refer to our guidelines for advice if a child on immune modifying drugs has been in contact with or contracts chicken-pox.

Prior to commencing biologic medications, the child's vaccination history will be checked. If children have not received the MMR or the pre-school booster of the MMR, this can be given early from 2 years of age. Alternatively titres can be checked to determine immunity status.

Patients on Rituximab should not be given live vaccines. Should non-live vaccinations be required, these should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to commencing the next course of Rituximab. Annual flu vaccines are recommended.

It is not known whether patients may need re-immunisation of previous non-live vaccines following rituximab. Once immunoglobulins are back to normal, check specific antibodies (Tetanus, Hib, Polio etc.) from previous immunisations and if low, re-immunise and recheck levels.

If a patient has a contaminated wound (and has received rituximab within the last 6 months) and there is any doubt about the patient’s tetanus status, then a tetanus immunoglobulin should be administered.

West Bengal, Gujarat, and Maharashtra have recently ramped up testing after the visits of central teams that raised concerns over high positives-low testing scenario in those states.Telangana had India’s highest positive rate at 27.7% and the country’s lowest number of tests per million population at a mere 14,690 from June 10-23, while Hyderabad recorded India’s second-highest positive rate at 32.1% on June 23, after Mumbai at 33%.Four teams comprising microbiologists and senior Telangana health ministry officials inspected all the 16 private labs and found “a lot of discrepancies” in the data uploaded by the private labs, said Telangana government in a Friday night statement.Accusing some labs of not having the trained staff and of not following “measures for quality control and validation of tests”, the Telangana government suspected some labs of pooled testing leading to reporting all as positives without doing individual testing.“It is also suspected that there is (a) possibility of contamination of samples leading to high positivity rate because safety measures and protocols are not followed meticulously,” said the Telangana health ministry, adding that some labs resorted to pooled testing, resulting in “some negative cases also being shown as positive.”The government said it will study all such cases with the help of experts “using the amplification plots generated by RTPCR machine” to check the veracity of the reports being uploaded by the private labs.While threatening to initiate ‘stringent action’ against the errant labs “for violating the norms and not following guidelines,” the Telangana government accused the private labs of giving “false positive reports.”Further, the Telangana health ministry also accused the private labs of conducting tests “for walk-ins” and collecting samples from different places in Hyderabad. According to it, the “government guidelines very clearly state that only symptomatic cases and patients admitted in hospitals should be tested and they are also not following ICMR Guidelines.”The Telangana government has also accused the private labs of reporting less than half the tests they had conducted, which has resulted in a high positivity rate, “which is actually less if the number of all tests done is uploaded.”Telangana reported 985 fresh Covid positive cases on Friday night, taking the total to 12,349 and of conducting 4,374 tests over the last 24 hours to take the total tests to 75,308 so far.

In Germany, the period of the ‘30s and first half of the ‘40s, was the first time electronic mass communication was used to propagandize the masses for control.

The evil Nazi genius, Joseph Goebbels, is arguably the leading modern propagandist.

His basic propaganda to defeat the Communist Party was to present it as being evil and the Nazi Party as righteous without using any real rationale, logic or facts.

His theory: “If you repeat a lie often enough people will believe it and you will even come to believe it yourself.”

He also said, “The bigger the lie the more it will be believed,” and, “There is no need for propaganda to be rich in intellectual content.”

Americans watching cable news networks seem to see this type of propaganda in play every day. Does this system work? Yes.

Goebbels was able to talk a Christian nation into justifying the murder of millions of people.

During the night of the long knives and shortly thereafter when Hitler had Ernst Rohm (head of the SA – or Storm Battallion) murdered, Goebbels propaganda machine exposed his evil homosexual lifestyle which they had known about for years and had kept it covered up because he previously benefited them.

It sounds like what happens frequently today when politicians and notables suddenly are exposed or fall from grace yet many people knew about their socially unacceptable, immoral or illegal activities for years."

And the results, they found, reveal a pretty paranoid America.

Time to break out the tinfoil hats! The government is trying to read your mind–or so nearly 1 in 6 voters would have you believe.

Public Policy Polling took the time this week to ask voters about 20 popular conspiracy theories, ranging from the political to the extraterrestrial. And the results, they found, reveal a pretty paranoid America–or a pretty hilarious America depending on how you slice it. Here are some standouts.

21% of voters say a UFO crashed in Roswell, NM

In the summer of 1947, an unidentified flying object reportedly crashed just north of the tiny city during a severe thunderstorm. The official word from the U.S. Army was that the object in question was debris from a high-altitude surveillance balloon. But many UFO proponents believe it was an alien spacecraft, and that the government has been engaged in a widespread cover-up. Roswell has its own museum dedicated to “educating the general public on all aspects of the UFO phenomena.” More Romney voters (27%) believe in a UFO cover-up than do Obama voters (16%).

28% of voters believe secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government, or New World Order

Popular among militant anti-government right-wingers and Christian fundamentalists, these conspiracy theorists speculate that the global power elite are hell-bent on creating an all-encompassing authoritarian regime to replace the sovereignty of independent nations. Some New World Order theorists believe the one-world government will correspond with the emergence of the antichrist, while others fear the global elite’s agenda could create a Brave New World-like dystopia. A recent Rasmussen poll found that two out of three Americans view their guns rights as protection against the tyranny of government. Once again, a plurality of Romney voters (38%) believe in the New World Order compared to 35% who don’t.

13% of voters think Barack Obama is the antichrist

No stranger to conspiracy theories, the president has elicited a hefty amount of public suspicion–from his religion, to his birthplace, to everything in between. But the antichrist theory really takes the cake, putting him with some pretty impressive company. Pope Benedict XVI, Prince William, and Oprah have all been associated with the messenger of the apocalypse. Twenty-two percent of Romney voters said they believe the Obama antichrist theory.

11% of voters believe the US government allowed 9/11 to happen

“Do these people just need an ulcer in their lives?” asked Daily Show creator Lizz Winstead on Hardball Wednesday. “There’s so much to worry about as it is, just being a regular person who thinks sanely. When you have to pile on insanity, I don’t know how you get through the day.” PPP found that the same number of respondents–11 percent–weren’t sure whether the government was involved in a 9/11 plot or not.

15% of voters say the government or the media adds mind-controlling technology to TV broadcast signals (the so-called Tinfoil Hat crowd)

I have nothing to add, this one is true. And as a professional member of the media, fully trained in mind-controlling technology, let me say this: hats won’t help you."

The president made the comment to reporters on Sunday outside the White House after returning from a weekend at Camp David.

""Look, he was an incompetent president, that's all I can say. Grossly incompetent,"" he said.

Trump was responding to remarks made by Obama during a virtual commencement speech to graduates of historically black colleges and universities, in which he said the coronavirus pandemic has ""torn back the curtain"" on a lack of US leadership.

""More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many folks in charge know what they're doing,"" Obama said during the live-streamed address.

""A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge,"" he added.

Trump said he had not seen Obama's remarks, nor did he elaborate on his comments about the former president.

Earlier in the day, White House adviser Peter Navarro mocked Obama on ABC’s This Week, saying that he’s ""glad Mr. Obama has a new job as Joe Biden's press secretary"".

Navarro said Obama’s remarks included ""no mention of manufacturing, no mention of China.""

""As far as I'm concerned, his administration was a kumbaya of incompetence, in which we saw millions of manufacturing jobs go off to China.""

The trade adviser continued: ""His new normal was a flat line in terms of wage growth.""

“And I'm happy to report that this president, Donald J. Trump, in three-and-a-half years, built the most beautiful economy in modern history. And the Chinese did take that down in about 30 days.""

Ex-presidents don’t typically speak out against their successors.

In addition to his remarks made on Saturday, Obama also recently lashed out at Trump during a call with supporters and former members of his administration.

""This election that’s coming up on every level is so important because what we’re going to be battling is not just a particular individual or a political party,"" Obama said.

""What we’re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy — that has become a stronger impulse in American life.""

""It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset — of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ — when that mindset is operationalized in our government.""

Obama added this was why he will be “spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can for Joe Biden.""

Obama has urged his supporters to back Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, who is trying to unseat Trump in November.

Trump has regularly attacked Obama and this week claimed he was guilty of the ""crime of the century.""

He claimed his predecessor had ordered intelligence agencies to spy on him, and demanded Republicans summon Obama to testify in an inquiry into the Russia investigation, which he deemed is the ""biggest political scandal in the history of the USA."""

Acrid whiffs of evaporating medicine hint at their purpose.

These are the instruments that brought down polio, smallpox and diphtheria—diseases that in the past two centuries have killed thousands annually. By the end of the 20th century, however, mass vaccination programs completely eradicated or brought these diseases under control both in the United States and abroad.

In the late 19th century, when James Flint (1838-1919), the Smithsonian’s first curator of Materia Medica (medical substances), began the collection, vaccines and serums were at the cutting edge of modern medicine. Flint collected some of the first vaccine products manufactured in America.

In the 1920s, Flint’s successor, Charles Whitebread, curated the Smithsonian’s first exhibition on vaccines to showcase the recent medical advances at the time and to help educate Americans about the power of vaccines and serums in arresting epidemics in their communities. And today, the American History Museum continues that effort, helping to explain the role and importance of vaccines in the nation's history.

Whitebread worked closely with pharmaceutical companies to acquire their latest products. Under his direction, the collection grew to about 100 specimens including the influenza and typhus vaccines developed during World War II. Following in his footsteps, curators today collect vaccines, syringes and serums from pharmaceutical companies, druggists, physicians and public health organizations, making the collection one of the largest and most complete in the country.

Some of the oldest objects in the collection include a patent model for a vaccinator that dates to the mid-1860s and a mid-19th-century scab carrier. (Yes, a scab!)

This small gold-plated case—not much bigger than a quarter—was used by a doctor to carry a fresh scab (or two) “picked” from a recent smallpox vaccination. The scab was still virulent and could cause a mild infection when a small piece was inserted under the skin—enough to confer immunity—to another individual. The rudimentary method helped to protect against smallpox. Alongside these crude relics from the early years of vaccination are some of the latest flu vaccines developed during the swine flu pandemic of 2009.

Most of the objects are from the United States, but because diseases do not respect national borders, curators have also collected objects associated with global campaigns to control or eradicate disease. The collection includes, for example, artifacts from the successful 1966 to 1980 campaign to eradicate smallpox. These objects range from posters recommending vaccination to postage stamps and samples of the vaccines and needles used by health care workers in the field. A sampling of the museum's medical collections were recently photographed by Smithsonian magazine's Brendan McCabe."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

The armed North Carolina man who traveled to a Washington D.C. pizzeria this weekend while self-investigating an wild internet conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton surrendered to authorities when his search yielded no evidence, according to court documents released Monday.

Edgar Welch, 28, was arraigned Monday on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license and other crimes, the documents say.

The documents allege that Welch, whose address is listed 250 miles south, in Durham, N.C., arrived at the pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, armed with an AR-15 rifle and a .38 caliber handgun just after 3 p.m. to help “rescue” child sex slaves that he believed were possibly being held there.

At the pizzeria on Sunday, a worker told police that he was outside when Welch apparently arrived. Identified only as CW-1 in the documents, the worker said that he stepped out to grab pizza dough when he heard three loud bangs coming from inside.

“CW-1 re-entered the restaurant and observed a white male holding an AR-15 type rifle,” the documents say, adding that when Welch allegedly swung the rifle towards him he immediately ran outside.

There, another person who had been in Comet was shouting: “He’s in there and he has a gun,” the documents say.

No one was injured in the incident, and by 3:15 p.m., a police barricade had been set up outside of Comet. Nine minutes after that, Welch set his guns down and walked outside with his hands raised, the documents say.

When a sergeant asked about motive, Welch “stated that he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that the wanted to see for himself if they were there,"" according to the documents.

The documents say that Welch then “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.”

On Sunday, Alefantis offered up Welch's actions as the logical but grim conclusion of fake news, telling reporters: ""What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theory does come with consequences.""

The roots of the so-called “PizzaGate” fake conspiracy theory can be traced to the email hacking of Hillary Clinton’s former presidential campaign chair, John Podesta, the New York Times reported last month.

Podesta casually knows the restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, the Times reported, and an email between the two about a fundraiser became the source of rampant, unfounded speculation among users of the message board 4Chan, who believed that high-level Democrats were operating a child abuse ring there.

Even though there was no evidence to support those claims, which Alefantis has emphatically denied, the theory was peddled on Reddit, Facebook and elsewhere."

This has led to a price collapse that, until now, was unthinkable to most oil investors and economists. The price of oil produced in the U.S. turned negative for the first time in history on Monday, April 20.﻿﻿ Traders worried about a glut of unsaleable oil sent the price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil plummeting as they paid other parties to take the over-supplied commodity off their hands.﻿﻿

While oil prices staged a modest rebound following the collapse, it's unclear whether the gains are sustainable. The reason: demand for oil is plummeting faster than supply in a shrinking global economy.

The latest turmoil marks another dramatic chapter in the history of oil, which has seen wild swings over the span of five decades. Those price moves have been sparked by a long list of seminal events, including the Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s, the First Gulf War in the early 1990s, the Great Recession of 2007-2009, and now the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020.

The upheaval in early 2020 is unlikely to end soon, even after Saudi Arabia and Russia have belatedly agreed to production cuts. ""This is off-the-charts wacky,"" observes energy equity analyst Stewart Glickman. ""The demand shock was so massive that it's overwhelmed anything that people could have expected.""﻿﻿ Aaron Brady, vice president for energy oil market services at research firm IHS Markit, agrees. “If you are a producer, your market has disappeared.”﻿﻿

Below we look at the major events since 1960 that have shaped the oil markets in the wake of the formation of OPEC. The events show that oil prices during this period have remained highly volatile even as nations have strived for stable and predictable economic growth. The data is based on the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude (WTI), as compiled by Macrotrends LLC from NYMEX data.﻿﻿

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was founded in 1960. The stated objective of member countries was ""to co-ordinate and unify petroleum policies among Member Countries, in order to secure fair and stable prices for petroleum producers.""﻿﻿ OPEC members function as a cartel, seeking to maximize their oil sales revenue by adjusting output in light of prevailing world economic conditions and demand.

But prices have been anything but stable. Initially, OPEC did not wield its full pricing power as a cartel in the 1960s. Oil prices were relatively stable until the 1970s amid U.S. oil companies' continued dominance of global crude markets, and due to plentiful U.S. oil reserves.

In retaliation for U.S support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, oil-producing Arab nations cut off crude exports to the U.S. As a result, the price of crude oil soared from about $24 to $56 per barrel by early 1974.﻿﻿

The pro-Western Shah fled Iran in January of 1979, with the anti-Western Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini emerging as the leader of an Islamist government that takes control. A sharp drop in Iranian production as a result of the political unrest sent crude oil prices even higher than during the Arab oil embargo. Oil jumped from about $56 per barrel to over $125.﻿﻿

Shortly after taking office in 1981, President Ronald Reagan signed an executive order abolishing price and allocation controls on domestic oil and gasoline production and distribution.﻿﻿ The price of crude fell from almost $113 per barrel in January 1981 to about $26 by mid-1986.﻿﻿

In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, sending the price of oil soaring from about $34 per barrel to nearly $77. After a U.S.-led military coalition succeeded in removing Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces from Kuwait in early 1991, the price fell to about $37.﻿﻿

In 2008, a series of events that cut global production sharply led to a significant spike in oil prices. Venezuela cut off sales to Exxon Mobil in a legal battle over nationalization of that company's properties. Exports from Iraq had not recovered from the most recent war in the region, and labor strikes reduced production in Nigeria and the U.K.'s North Sea oil fields. Militants blew up oil facilities and pipelines in Nigeria. Mexico endured a severe decline in production from one of its major oil fields.﻿﻿

From about $118 per barrel in December 2007, the price of oil rose to above $165 by mid-2008. The spike capped a long uptrend in oil's price since bottoming at about $28 in late 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon in Washington.﻿﻿

The second half of 2008 was marked by a deepening economic recession, accompanied by a severe financial crisis. Oil sank to the low $50s per barrel by January 2009 before rebounding to nearly $95 by year-end as the global economy recovered.

U.S. oil and gas output increased by about 57% over the past decade until early 2020 as advances in fracking technology unlocked vast reserves in various areas of the country. Fracking returned the U.S. to the status of one of the world's biggest oil producers, reducing U.S. demand for imported oil and turning the U.S. into a net exporter. At its peak, the Permian Basin region of Texas and New Mexico has produced more crude oil than most OPEC nations.﻿﻿

Partly as a result, the price of crude oil fell from about $87 per barrel in early 2010 to just under $51 by January 2020.﻿﻿"

Since being struck off the British medical register over a discredited study suggesting a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism, Mr Wakefield has become a prominent figure within America’s anti-vaccine movement.

Now, with the outbreak of Covid-19 in the US, Mr Wakefield has been appearing alongside other prominent vaccine sceptics who promote unfounded theories that call into doubt the severity of the virus and suggest its dangers have been exaggerated in order to force the public to receive mandatory vaccinations.

In one recent appearance, Mr Wakefield called on his followers to protest “in numbers that are sufficient to terrify the politicians into doing the right thing”. He went on to warn of a scenario in which vaccines will cause “one in two children” to have autism by 2032.

“Vaccines are going to kill us,” he added, “people need to wake up to that”.

Offering a dystopian view of the future, he said: “Everything [else] is irrelevant... that's what we face, it's so enormous that people can't even conceptualise where we are.”

The comments were made during a nine-part documentary series entitled ""The Truth About Vaccines"", in which Mr Wakefield is identified as a gastroenterologist and a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. The Royal College of Surgeons confirmed to The Telegraph that Mr Wakefield has not been a member of the body since 1996.

Another prominent anti-vaccine activist and close friend of Mr Wakefield, Del Bigtree, also appears in the series to claim the latest vaccine discussion is an attempt ""by the pharmaceutical industry to take over our lives once and for all"".

There is no evidence that vaccines are unsafe, and most health officials agree that a safe and effective treatment is the only long term route out of the current pandemic."

It's only natural that Big Oil wanted in on Iraq. Russia's Lukoil and French giant Total had even been negotiating with the regime of Saddam Hussein for future projects despite ongoing international sanctions. According to The Independent, BP was especially concerned that if Total was able to follow through on its tentative deals after Saddam, the oil volumes could potentially boost Total to the biggest oil company in the world. The report quotes a memo from the U.K. foreign office from November 20o2 written by an official who had just met with BP. It read: ""Iraq is the big oil prospect. BP are desperate to get in there and anxious that political deals should not deny them the opportunity to compete. The long-term potential is enormous...""

The investigation will specifically look into whether the CIA gave director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal “inappropriate” access to secret material, and also whether members of the spy agency were responsible for the portrayal of brutal interrogation techniques and the implication that they were effective.

The film has already found itself in hot water after several senators called Zero Dark Thirty‘s torture scenes “grossly inaccurate and misleading in its suggestion that torture resulted in information that led to the location of bin Laden. Sony released a response from Boal and Bigelow that said the movie showed “a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods” and “that no single method was necessarily responsible for solving the manhunt.”

Though the movie is a dramatized account of the hunt for the Al Qaeda leader, documents obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch showed that Boal and Bigelow were in touch with top CIA and Pentagon officials, including Michael Morrell, the CIA’s current acting chief (he was deputy director at the time) and Michael Vickers, the Pentagon’s current intelligence chief.

Many of the documents were heavily redacted, though one Pentagon e-mail exchange with senior White House national security aide Ben Rhodes revealed that CIA officials had briefed Boal “with the full knowledge and full approval/support” of Leon Panetta, who served as CIA director, then Secretary of Defense, while the film was being made.

In response to the initial letter from Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-California), Carl Levin (D-Michigan) and John McCain (R-Arizona) regarding the depiction of torture in Zero Dark Thirty, the CIA released a statement by Morell who said the film was a “dramatization, not a realistic portrayal of the facts,” and that while the CIA had “interacted” with Boal and Bigellow the agency didn’t “control the final product.”"

Most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of 2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess, “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.”

Muhammad was born around 570, AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia). His father died before he was born and he was raised first by his grandfather and then his uncle. He belonged to a poor but respectable family of the Quraysh tribe. The family was active in Meccan politics and trade.

Many of the tribes living in the Arabian Peninsula at the time were nomadic, trading goods as they crisscrossed the desert. Most tribes were polytheistic, worshipping their own set of gods. The town of Mecca was an important trading and religious center, home to many temples and worship sites where the devoted prayed to the idols of these gods. The most famous site was the Kaaba (meaning cube in Arabic). It is believed to have been built by Abraham (Ibrahim to Muslims) and his son Ismail. Gradually the people of Mecca turned to polytheism and idolatry. Of all the gods worshipped, it is believed that Allah was considered the greatest and the only one without an idol.

In his early teens, Muhammad worked in a camel caravan, following in the footsteps of many people his age, born of meager wealth. Working for his uncle, he gained experience in commercial trade traveling to Syria and eventually from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean. In time, Muhammad earned a reputation as honest and sincere, acquiring the nickname “al-Amin” meaning faithful or trustworthy.

In his early 20s, Muhammad began working for a wealthy merchant woman named Khadijah, 15 years his senior. She soon became attracted to this young, accomplished man and proposed marriage. He accepted and over the years the happy union brought several children. Not all lived to adulthood, but one, Fatima, would marry Muhammad’s cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib, whom Shi’ite Muslims regard as Muhammad’s successor.

Muhammad was also very religious, occasionally taking journeys of devotion to sacred sites near Mecca. On one of his pilgrimages in 610, he was meditating in a cave on Mount Jabal aI-Nour. The Angel Gabriel appeared and relayed the word of God: “Recite in the name of your Lord who creates, creates man from a clot! Recite for your lord is most generous….” These words became the opening verses of sūrah (chapter) 96 of the Qur'an. Most Islamic historians believe Muhammad was initially disturbed by the revelations and that he didn’t reveal them publicly for several years. However, Shi’a tradition states he welcomed the message from the Angel Gabriel and was deeply inspired to share his experience with other potential believers.

Islamic tradition holds that the first persons to believe were his wife, Khadija and his close friend Abu Bakr (regarded as the successor to Muhammad by Sunni Muslims). Soon, Muhammad began to gather a small following, initially encountering no opposition. Most people in Mecca either ignored him or mocked him as just another prophet. However, when his message condemned idol worship and polytheism, many of Mecca’s tribal leaders began to see Muhammad and his message as a threat. Besides going against long standing beliefs, the condemnation of idol worship had economic consequences for merchants who catered to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Mecca every year. This was especially true for members of Muhammad’s own tribe, the Quraysh, who were the guardians of the Kaaba. Sensing a threat, Mecca’s merchants and leaders offered Muhammad incentives to abandon his preaching, but he refused.

Increasingly, the resistance to Muhammed and his followers grew and they were eventually forced to emigrate from Mecca to Medina, a city 260 miles to the north in 622. This event marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. There Muhammad was instrumental in bringing an end to a civil war raging amongst several of the city’s tribes. Muhammad settled in Medina, building his Muslim community and gradually gathering acceptance and more followers.

Between 624 and 628, the Muslims were involved in a series of battles for their survival. In the final major confrontation, The Battle of the Trench and Siege of Medina, Muhammad and his followers prevailed and a treaty was signed. The treaty was broken by the Meccan allies a year later. By now, Muhammad had plenty of forces and the balance of power had shifted away from the Meccan leaders to him. In 630, the Muslim army marched into Mecca, taking the city with minimum casualties. Muhammad gave amnesty to many of the Meccan leaders who had opposed him and pardoned many others. Most of the Meccan population converted to Islam. Muhammad and his followers then proceeded to destroy all of the statues of pagan gods in and around the Kaaba.

After the conflict with Mecca was finally settled, Muhammad took his first true Islamic pilgrimage to that city and in March, 632, he delivered his last sermon at Mount Arafat. Upon his return to Medina to his wife’s home, he fell ill for several days. He died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62, and was buried at al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) one of the first mosques built by Muhammad in Medina."

For thousands of years, the beauty and scarcity of gold have made it the world's de facto currency. Gold coins were first minted in 550 B.C.E. and modern paper currencies were backed by the ""gold standard"" into the 20th century.

Today, investors still view gold as the ultimate ""safe haven"" commodity, something tangible that retains its value compared to ""paper"" investments like cash, stocks and bonds. That's why you'll start to see TV commercials and online ads for gold coins whenever there's fear and uncertainty about the economic future. And when demand for gold increases, the price goes up.

""Anytime there's market uncertainty caused by geopolitical uncertainty, you'll see gold prices rally,"" says Jim Wyckoff, senior markets analyst for Kitco Metals.

That helps explain why the price of gold skyrocketed in the first decade of the 21st century. At the close of 2000, when the stock market was soaring and the dot-com bubble had yet to burst, gold was trading at just $272.65 an ounce. But starting in 2001, with the economy in recession plus the 9/11 attacks, investors started buying up gold.

By August 2011, a few years into the Great Recession and a decade into the War on Terror, nervous investors pushed the price of gold to an all-time high of $1,917.90 an ounce.

Should You Buy Gold in Uncertain Economic Times?

Even though gold holds its value over the long-term, especially compared to paper currencies that are subject to inflation, short-term investment in gold can be risky. Gold prices rise and fall according to global economic conditions and investor sentiment, just like stocks or other investments.

Just look at what happened in February and March 2020. As fears spread about the growing coronavirus pandemic and its effect on the economy, investors turned to gold as a safe haven, which drove the price up. On March 4, the price of gold reached over $1,700 per ounce. And logic said that as long as the stock market continued to slide, more people would turn to gold, pushing the price even higher.

But then something unexpected and far more dramatic happened. The bottom completely fell out of the stock market and a decade-long bull market turned into a vicious bear, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting more than 20 percent in a matter of days.

As investors saw their stocks take huge losses, they received margin calls from their brokers to cover any leveraged positions. To cover those margins, they needed cash and fast.

""There's an old saying in investment, 'When you can't sell what you want, you sell what you can,'"" says Wyckoff. ""That's what's happened with the gold market. The gold market is more liquid, so traders were able to sell some of the gold that they purchased as a hedge against stock market weakness.""

From March 11 to March 16, the price of gold matched the stock market slide and fell over 20 percent.

With extreme volatility in the financial markets and crippling uncertainty in the global economy, it's a challenging time to be an investor. That said, Wyckoff fully expects the bleeding in the gold market to stop and for gold to make a rally.

""Commodities are highly cyclical in nature,"" says Wyckoff. ""If you look at long-term charts, they go up and down sharply. That repeats itself time and time again. I suspect that in the coming years, or even this year, gold prices are going to reach all-time highs above $2,000 an ounce. That's not a bold prediction on my part, just an examination of the cyclicality of commodity markets.""

So, should you buy gold? ""Buying gold as a small percentage of one's overall investment portfolio is a good idea,"" says Wyckoff.

One of the reasons why gold prices are so sensitive to fluctuations in demand is that the supply of gold is pretty much fixed. Gold is difficult and expensive to mine, so there's really not that much of it in circulation.

Our best estimate is that only 209,483 tons (190,040 metric tons) of gold have been mined in all of human history, and that number only increases by between 2,755 and 3,306 tons (2,500 and 3,000 metric tons) of newly mined gold a year. Compare that to steel: In just one week, the U.S. forged 1.8 million tons (1.6 million metric tons) of steel.

The price of gold is set by the London Bullion Market Association based on financial evaluations of anonymous auctions that are run every 45 seconds. There are two main prices: the gold spot price and the gold futures price. The spot price is the current price of gold. You generally buy gold at a percentage higher than the spot price and sell it for the spot price. The spot price is based on supply and demand for gold from investors, banks, etc.; market conditions as well as whether a currency is depreciating.

The futures price is a contract for the delivery of gold at a date in the future and is based on the spot price, predicted supply and demand and the cost of physically transporting the metal. Gold futures are considered highly risky (you can read more about setting the gold price here.)

How to Invest in Gold

There are three major ways to invest in gold, each with their pros and cons:

You can purchase gold online, in some stores and, in the case of the ETFs, from an investment firm."
868,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions agents from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Justice Department interrogating Saddam Hussein.,True,The article discusses the trial and prosecution of Saddam Hussein.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Where will former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein be put on trial, who will prosecute and defend him, and if found guilty will he face the death penalty? Those are some of the questions specialists in international law are debating about what is likely to be one of the most watched trials in modern history.

Since Saddam Hussein's capture on December 13 last year, agents from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, and the Justice Department have been interrogating the former Iraqi dictator.

In addition to whatever information comes from this questioning, there is a large amount of evidence and many witnesses that could support charges of atrocities by Saddam's regime over many years.

Laurence Rothenberg, a specialist in international law at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, says the circumstances of the crimes allegedly committed by Saddam Hussein are well known.

""Saddam was responsible for at least 300,000 murders and hundreds of thousands more tortures and perhaps as many as a million people were ultimately killed by his regime,"" he said. ""Those include people who were victims of genocide, the Kurds, the Shiite marsh Arabs in the south of the country and also smaller minority groups.""

Mr. Rothenberg argues that despite the huge amount of evidence against Saddam, it is important to put him on trial in Baghdad.

He says this is essential for the people of Iraq and the world.

""The question, of course, is what is the purpose of trying Saddam and there are many purposes in holding a war crimes tribunal and it is not just to establish guilt,"" he said. ""It would also be things like providing catharsis for the victims, which I view as one of the most important issues and one of the main reasons for having it in Iraq itself. Another reason is to establish a record for history to expose what Saddam's regime was and that provides an element of catharsis not only for the victims, but also for the rest of the Arab and Muslim world and the international world.""

Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, argues that Saddam's prosecution should be led by Iraqis, but says local attorneys and judges need international expertise to properly handle a trial of this magnitude.

""Those who were in Iraq during Saddam's period, the lawyers and jurists there, include many people who I am sure are very, very decent, committed people who want to see this done right,"" he said. ""But they have no experience, in our interviews with these folks, of any trial that has lasted more than a day or two. That is simply the way things worked in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.""

If Saddam is found guilty should he be given the death penalty?

Mr. Malinowski says given the country's recent history the answer may be no.

""Keep in mind that for the last 30 years Iraq was governed by the death penalty,"" he noted. ""It was governed by a culture of death, and retribution and revenge. That was the solution to every problem in Iraq. I would argue that if you want this country to turn the corner, if the Iraqi people want to build an entirely new society that is different in a revolutionary way from what they had before, one of the best ways they can do that is to establish a government that no longer claims for itself the right to kill its own people, even under the most extreme circumstances.""

Laurence Rothenberg of the Center for Strategic and International Studies strongly disagrees. He says given the severity of the crimes allegedly committed by Saddam, the death penalty is the only appropriate sentence.

""In my opinion the only thing that comes close to an appropriate punishment for murdering 300,000 people and torturing others, throwing some people live into industrial shredding machines, cutting off people's ears and tongues and raping their wives and daughters in front of them, is the death penalty,"" he said. ""If it were up to me Saddam would be executed 300,000 times, once for every victim.""

The Bush administration has said Saddam will be turned over to a new Iraqi government, although it is still not clear when he will go on trial.

Secretary of State Colin Powell has indicated it could occur as early as July, when a provisional Iraqi government is scheduled to be established.

""The credibility of the new Iraqi government will be measured by how they handle this horrible dictator,"" Secretary Powell said."

CLAIM: Video shows people in China taking down 5G poles to “cure coronavirus.”



AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The video was filmed on August 24 during protests in Hong Kong. Protesters are taking down a so-called smart lamppost, which people allege contain cameras and sensors. 



THE FACTS: A video circulated on Facebook with the false claim that it shows people in China tearing down a 5G pole, implying China “found the cure” to coronavirus. 



In the video, people who are wearing masks and holding umbrellas are recorded while pulling down a lamp post. 



The video was also posted on Instagram with the false caption: “The Chinese are destroying the 5G poles as they are aware that it is the thing triggering the Corona syndrome. But international news not showing this.”



For months there have been conspiracy theories floating the idea that 5G was behind the virus. China was rolling out 5G cellular service around the same time that coronavirus cases spiked in the country. Fifth-generation cellular networks promise fast download speeds for smartphone users. The new technology also presents some security challenges since 5G sensors will be embedded into many devices like thermostats and medical sensors. 



In reality, the video was filmed in Hong Kong on August 24. According to AP reporting, protesters on that day targeted smart lamp posts, which people feared contained cameras and sensors. A search on Google Earth shows the video was filmed outside a large shopping mall called MegaBox, which is located on Lam Fung Street in Hong Kong.

AP photographer Kin Cheung was at the scene and captured the incident. Umbrellas captured in Cheung’s image match those in the video.

870,False,This article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions several actors, including Crocker, Talabani, Nouri al-Maliki, and regional powers like Turkey, Iran, and Syria.",True,"The article discusses the actions of the U.S. and Iraqi government, negotiating agreements, working with Nouri al-Maliki, and the Kurdish vote for an independent homeland.",False,There is no mention of threats in the article.,False,There is no mention of patterns in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"“Everybody knew that they were being played, that he was telling you a little bit of what you wanted to hear,” Van Heuvelen said, “but he did it with enough charm that you didn’t begrudge him for it.”

When Crocker returned to Iraq in 2007, as the U.S. ambassador, he said he and Talabani “picked up where we left off.” The U.S. and Iraqi government moved through several challenges, including the surge of U.S. troops that pushed back the largely Sunni insurgency, negotiating agreements among Iraq’s disparate interest groups, working with Nouri al-Maliki, the controversial Iraqi prime minister of the time, and negotiating the strategic framework agreement, which covered the U.S. relationship with Iraq.

“He would host meetings at his residence. Everybody would come. There really was not another figure that could do that, up to and including the prime minister,” Crocker said. “It was invaluable to efforts to get at compromises on those agreements and on other things.”

But the conditions, including its vast oil wealth, that made Kurdistan a success story also led to wariness among not only its fellow Iraqis, but also Iraq’s neighbors in Turkey, Iran, and Syria, each with its own significant Kurdish populations. They feared that the KRG’s success could embolden their own Kurdish populations to seek greater autonomy—or worse, independence. Talabani himself claimed to oppose Kurdish independence because, as he told Jon Lee Anderson, the New Yorker reporter, in 2007: “Let us imagine that Iraqi Kurdistan declared independence, and Iran, Syria, Turkey, and Iraq didn’t fight it but just closed their borders. How could we live? Let us say, we’ve got our oil—how could we export it?” He went on, “And you can be sure that if Kurdistan declares independence Iran will attack, Turkey will attack, Syria will attack—and Iraq will not accept it. We cannot resist all these countries.”

Crocker, who told me he’d never directly spoken to Talabani about Kurdish independence, explained the Kurdish leader’s worldview in this way: “He was keenly aware that, while there could be some debate on what the worst of times was in the modern period—because the Kurds in Iraq had an awful lot of bad times—there was no question in his mind that the post-’03 situation was the best of times for the Kurds—and he wouldn’t take action that would jeopardize it.”

Talabani’s prediction to the New Yorker a decade ago is now prophetic. The overwhelming Kurdish vote last month in favor of an independent homeland was met with equally overwhelming criticism not only from the countries Talabani mentioned, but also the United States, perhaps the Kurds’ greatest ally. As regional powers take steps to punish the Kurds for their actions—the Iraqi central bank said Tuesday it would stop sending foreign currency to the KRG—the absence of a figure like Talabani will be felt. Van Heuvelen said the current political climate benefits both Arab and Kurdish hardliners and any moderating influence could be painted as weak.

“Talabani had such a larger-than-life persona, both privately, among other members of the political class, and publicly, beloved in Kurdistan, that he was in some ways immune to those concerns,” Van Heuvelen told me. “In a situation like this, when you have Kurdish nationalism and Arab nationalism clashing ... he’s a figure who would have been able to moderate the tense climate without sacrificing his own political stance.”"

The whole affair stems from Virginia’s 5th Congressional District race, where Democratic candidate Leslie Cockburn tweeted on Sunday that her opponent — Republican candidate Denver Riggleman — is “a devotee of Bigfoot erotica”.

While perhaps humorous for anyone who does not take every twist and turn of a political race in the US completely seriously, the tweet has nonetheless caught fire online, and has led to a huge jump in interest in the mythical woodland creature’s sexual life.

“My opponent Denver Riggleman, running mate of Corey Stewart, was caught on camera campaigning with a white supremacist. Now he has been exposed as a devotee of Bigfoot erotica. This is not what we need on Capitol Hill”, Ms Cockbrun wrote in a tweet that included a photograph of a nude Bigfoot that was apparently pulled from Mr Riggleman’s Instagram account.

Mr Riggleman has denied the accusation and told CNN that he wrote a couple books about Bigfoot. During that interview, Mr Riggleman acknowledged writing an unpublished text with the title of “The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him”. He added that the books were parodies.

But the clash has sparked interest online. On Google, for instance, searches for “Bigfoot erotica” spiked on July 30, far surpassing any previous search spike in the history of the company for the pairing of words (previously the most interest in the term came in January of 2014, although it is unclear why people were so interested then.

The Congressional race in Virginia has also led to a spike in, well, let’s say, “private” interest in Bigfoot. Searches for “Bigfoot erotica” on the popular pornography website Pornhub, for instance, increased 8,000 per cent following the claims against Mr Riggleman

Whatever the case, the two congressional candidates will face off in the upcoming midterm elections in November. They will be replacing Representative Thomas Garrett, who decided not to seek reelection this ear in an announcement in which he declared that he is an alcoholic."

For him, the stakes are high and the attacks and casualties are real. Wanting readers to know how to fight back — for freedom, for liberty and for the way of life that all Americans cherish, Corder wrote his new book, ""War for Your Worldview: What Every American Needs to Know in the Age of Fake News, Social Engineering, and Mind-Controlling Propaganda"" (published by Archway Publishing).

The book is a nonfictional political treatise that focuses on how social engineering and mind control are being used to steer the nations of the world into a single world government. It presents academic research to unmask those responsible for what Corder has found to be insidious, century-long plot by the elite cabal to undermine the founding principles of the United States of America. The book also describes what average citizens can do to resist their efforts to ""destroy our civilization.""

""In this book, you will learn how divisive rhetoric and emotionally charged propaganda are presenting direct threats to our civil liberties, and how blatant attacks on patriotism, Christianity, and the U.S. Constitution are erasing our national identity,"" Corder says. ""You will also discover how deadly drugs, mass immigration and socialist policies are all being promoted to weaken us as a nation — to destroy our people by bringing chaos and disorder to our lives and our communities and you won't get these explosive truths from the mainstream media, or anywhere else.""

The publication of ""War for Your Worldview: What Every American Needs to Know in the Age of Fake News, Social Engineering, and Mind-Controlling Propaganda"" reminds readers that the war is real and that it is being waged through the manipulation of their minds. However, they can conquer evil with the power of knowledge, common sense and by remaining true to their founding principles.

But here’s a start: The richest three people in the United States — Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett — together have more wealth than the entire bottom half of the country combined.

To put an even finer point on it: That’s three people versus about 160 million people.



To really comprehend just how insane the wealth concentration has become, consider Bezos, the head of Amazon. Worth about $90 billion, he recently was declared the richest man in the world. In October alone, his wealth jumped by $10 billion — or more than $13 million per hour.

Given his massive wealth, one might imagine that his company has enough to pay its warehouse workers a minimum of $15 an hour. But apparently it doesn’t. Amazon pays some of its workers as little as $12.84 an hour.

That’s pretty much the trend we’re seeing play out over and over across the U.S. economy— wealth funneling to a tiny group at the top while everyone else scrambles for crumbs.

On the other end of the spectrum from Bezos, tens of millions of families are trying desperately to make their paychecks last through the week. One in 5 households has zero or negative wealth today, meaning they have as much debt as they do assets. (That’s why the three-versus-160 million figure is so stark: Many people have nothing.)

Having no savings or wealth means having no cushion to fall back on when you’re hit with the unexpected — an illness or medical emergency that results in large hospital bills, say, or the loss of a job. With no buffer, even a broken-down car can wreak financial havoc on a family, turning a stable situation into quicksand. We see this domino effect play out all the time, as our social media feeds are filled with crowdfunding requests by people who need help covering basic life expenses.

Not surprisingly, these zero-wealth households are disproportionately African American or Latino, a result of our country’s long history of discrimination. Three in 10 black households are underwater. Nearly the same proportion of Latino households are too.

The problem is getting worse, not better. Today, the poorest member of the Forbes 400 has $2 billion. This represents a tenfold jump from when the magazine first started its list in 1982. And that’s after adjusting for inflation.

In fact, with a combined wealth of $2.68 trillion, the billionaires of the Forbes 400 have more wealth than the entire GDP of the United Kingdom, the world’s fifth wealthiest country. This marks yet another tenfold increase from the 1980s.

The rest of the country has not shared in the economic gains of the past three decades. In 1983, the first year the Federal Reserve started collecting consistent data, the median family had $83,000 in today’s terms. That number has now fallen to $80,000.

In other words, while today’s 400 richest Americans are 10 times richer than 1983’s richest Americans, the median family is worse off than the median family 34 years ago.

The few at the top of the ladder have captured a massive share of the nation’s wealth, and they’re quickly translating that wealth into political power — pushing for more tax cuts for themselves, to be shepherded through the legislative process by politicians who are indebted to them for their campaign contributions. This is a moral disgrace.

We urgently need to close, not expand, our wealth divide. And we need to start by saying no to more tax cuts for the wealthy and growing economic opportunities for everyone else. Enough is enough.

You may think of helium as the stuff in party balloons, or the gas that can make your voice squeaky. But helium has revealed itself to have an array of more practical uses, from essential equipment in science labs to common medical scanners and even scuba tanks.

While this wonder gas is the second most abundant element in the universe, it's a slippery thing to grab ahold of on Earth. Combine that with a meager supply chain, and you end up with a global helium market that's shockingly fragile. From 2011 to 2013, the helium industry faced shortfalls of 20 percent, leading to crippling shortages.

With a boiling point at -452 degrees Fahrenheit, helium's liquid state is the coldest of any element, and it doesn't freeze at everyday pressures, making it the world's best coolant. Superconducting magnets, such as the ones in MRI scanners or crucial pieces of chemistry lab equipment, don't work unless they're bathed in liquid helium. (Here's how scientists are using MRI scans to try and see our dreams.)

For hundreds of millions of years, the decay of radioactive elements deep inside the planet spawned helium, which meandered its way upward until getting caught in geological formations. The gas is constantly bubbling up; for every 191,000 particles of air swirling around you, one is helium. But the gas is so light, it's one of the few parts of our atmosphere that can easily escape Earth's gravitational pull.

At present, it's unfeasibly expensive to pull it from the air itself, so the helium industry rides fossil fuels' coattails. Practically all of the helium sold today is a byproduct of the natural gas industry, since some of the rock formations that catch hydrocarbons also can stop helium in its tracks. Each year, the world goes through about 6.2 billion cubic feet of helium: enough to fill more than 10,000 giant balloons like the ones you'd see at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

Not every deposit of natural gas bears helium, though, and it doesn't always make financial sense for companies to refine their byproduct helium, so we end up with a surprisingly tiny group of key suppliers. Phil Kornbluth, a longtime helium industry consultant, says that only 14 plants on Earth refine helium into liquid form, and they're found in just six countries: Seven of the plants are in the U.S., and the rest are spread across Qatar, Algeria, Russia, Poland, and Australia.

It doesn't take much to send the helium market into a tailspin. Last summer, a coalition of Arab countries blockaded Qatar, ratcheting up diplomatic tensions in the Middle East. It turns out that thanks to its massive liquefied natural gas industry, Qatar has a lot of byproduct helium—so it's now one of the world's biggest helium suppliers. The blockade temporarily knocked out a full 30 percent of the world's helium supply.

The helium market's core currently lurks underneath Amarillo, Texas. Since the 1920s, the town has been home to the Federal Helium Reserve, a massive underground geological formation that acts as the U.S. strategic supply. Amarillo calls itself the Helium Capital of the World; there's a monument to the element in town, a six-story steel spire with a model of a helium atom at its center.

At its height, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management facility held 30 billion cubic feet of helium, enough to meet 15 years of global demand at the time. But now, the reserve is winding down, after Congress passed laws that will eventually take the U.S. government out of the helium business. In 1996, Congress required the BLM to sell off its helium stores at a fixed rate and then abruptly close in 2013. But instead of closing the reserve, Congress smoothed out its descent in 2013, giving it until September 30, 2021, to sell its helium stores in a series of auctions.

“In the past, we were considered a flywheel—whenever there were impacts in the delivery system, we could ramp up and produce and keep enough helium in the system, where the shortages were short-term,” says Samuel Burton, the field manager at the BLM field office in Amarillo. “Now, as we wind down our program, there really needs to be more helium found, more production created, and more secure delivery systems in place.”

The move to close the reserve worries U.S. scientists. In the last decade, the price of helium has gone up more than 250 percent, dealing a blow to some research budgets. In a 2016 report assembled by three scientific societies, some researchers described forfeiting their summer salaries just so they could afford the helium to do their experiments.

New helium plants in Russia and Qatar are coming online in the next few years, but Elsesser and other experts also note that helium is, in some applications, irreplaceable—which makes the need to use it wisely all the more important.

“Industry and scientists are going to be really creative,” says Kornbluth, the industry consultant. “If we get to the point where we just can't keep up with demand, either prices will go up to create new incentives to find more, or we're going to develop substitute technologies that don't rely on helium.”"
876,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,There are no explicit or indirect mentions of actors responsible for a threat or malicious actions.,False,There are no mentions of powerful actors intentionally pursuing malicious motives or schemes.,False,There are no mentions of threats caused by actors' actions.,False,There are no connections made between events or observations to form a pattern.,False,There are no indications of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"At the moment, the U.S. public sector budget deficit is on the way to 5 percent of GDP, the public debt is running well over 108 percent of GDP, and this year's deficit on trades in goods and services with the rest of the world is currently estimated at more than half-a-trillion dollars, or about 3 percent of GDP.

And here is the upshot: Failure to stem America's decades-old rise of external deficits has led to a systematic borrowing of world savings to make ends meet. As a result, the country's net foreign debt position at the end of the second quarter of this year reached a record-high $8.6 trillion, marking an astounding $891 billion increase in net international liabilities from the previous three-month period.

That is the picture of a structurally unbalanced and a very vulnerable U.S. economy facing an unsettled political situation at home and growing security challenges abroad.

Predictably perhaps, foreign creditors are responding with a declining interest in American public debt instruments. During the 12 months to last October, non-resident holdings of U.S. Treasury securities fell by $124.5 billion.

Over that period, China and Japan, the largest investors in U.S. government bonds, trimmed their portfolios by a combined total of $128.8 billion, while running a $400.5 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in the first 10 months of this year.

A very intriguing gesture indeed: China and Japan not only declined to recycle back to the U.S. some of the dollar income from their large trade surpluses, but they also continued to actively sell their Treasury holdings.

There is a twofold message there. First, those sales could be seen as hedges against America's widely expected interest rate increases. Second, one can also see there a political subtext without falling into an exaggerated reading of unfriendly behavior.

Japan has been increasingly concerned about the forthcoming trade negotiations with the U.S., and could have been venting some of its displeasure by selling Treasury securities while pocketing a $56 billion surplus on its American goods trades.

China is a more complex case because Beijing's difficult trade negotiations with Washington are bound up with hostilities concerning China's maritime borders, arms sales to Taiwan, relations with Tibet and divergent views about peace and nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula."
877,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions actors such as the Treasury Department, Secretary Geithner, George Soros, and Henry Paulson.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by the Treasury Department, Secretary Geithner, and Henry Paulson.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"The argument over the Treasury Department's use of new TARP funds and other stimuli focused a great deal on putting $500 billion into propping up banks and another $1 trillion into freeing up credit. Some media outlets put the total number closer to $2 trillion. The truth is there are so many moving parts in the programs that it is easy to see how even the most sophisticated observers might miss a detail.

The Treasury plans got a lot of incoming fire because they assume participation by the private sector in the process of buying assets from banks. Secretary Geithner made a very big mistake by not bringing one of these private investors to the press conference where he presented his plan. Either George Soros was not available or he turned the opportunity down. (See pictures of the global financial crisis.)

Analysts are also upset because the presentation did not come with a Gantt chart showing the details and timing of each aspect of every program in the bailout. They are afraid that it is simply written on a cocktail napkin, which is exactly what Henry Paulson did with the diagram of how he intended to spend the $350 billion that he wanted to put into the banking system.

Paulson may not be remembered kindly by many who thought he told the Congress he would buy toxic assets from financial firms and then bought preferred shares in them instead. But, Paulson was in a race, which may have lasted only days if it had failed, to save the largest money center firms from collapsing.

Paulson's lesson is that there is always more money. That is true at least in a panic when the Congress and Administration have convinced themselves, perhaps appropriately, that pushing huge amounts of capital into the economy is the only way to halt the recession.

What was not considered at any length in the Treasury presentation is how fast the money can be moved onto bank balance sheets and into facilities that can free up consumer and business spending. The phase used is always ""immediately"", but that may be a long time depending on the flexibility of the bureaucracy that has to handle the funds.

Nearly everyone believes one thing and it is at the core of any consensus about keeping the economic system out of a depression. Time is more important than money, if the money is enough to make a good start. It would have been uncomfortable for Secretary Geithner to say out loud that he might well have to come back to Congress for more money. If the damage to credit markets gets worse, Congress will probably be cooperative even if it results in more fighting.

The only thing Geithner could have said that was almost certainly accurate is that he has a good plan, he is working on details which are hard to pin down because the crisis is spreading so quickly, and he will be back for more money once he understands where the problems are getting much worse. He is being asked to ride a bicycle in a hurricane. It may not be reasonable to ask how many times he might fall.

Its impact on the global economy has been equally catastrophic, as governments have been forced into imposing strict lockdown measures. As economists face a generation-defining challenge on what to do next, all around the world focus is beginning to shift towards finance ministers – like Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the UK – rather than health ministers such as Matt Hancock.

But a warning from Mr Soros – the famed financier and philanthropist who was once credited with ‘breaking the pound’ – appears worryingly relevant today. Speaking to Newsweek in 2012, the billionaire warned of economic collapse and riots on the streets in light of the eurozone crisis of the time. Having bought $2billion (£1.6billion) in European bonds, he said: “The euro must survive because the alternative – a breakup – would cause a meltdown that Europe, the world, can’t afford. “The situation is about as serious and difficult as I’ve experienced in my career. We are facing now a general retrenchment in the developed world.”

His warnings came as US stocks plummeted amid talks intended to resolve Greece's debt crisis faltered. “The worst-case scenario is a collapse of the financial system.” The now 89-year-old also compared the crisis to the fall of the Soviet Union in the early Nineties, claiming a euro collapse could “revive the political conflicts that have torn Europe apart over the centuries”.

His fears appear just as relevant today as they did in 2012, as EU member states have been embroiled in a bitter row over how to split up the financial costs of the pandemic. Italy, for example, has consistently argued for more help from its European partners, as the current crisis was impossible to predict. While Germany and the Netherlands are opposed to the idea as they fear the political implications of having their taxpayers foot the bill for other nations. DON'T MISS

These divisions have opened up old wounds from the 2008 financial crisis. And former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis believes he can explain why – because the wounds never healed in the first place, they were merely hidden from view. In a video posted on his YouTube channel DiEM25 earlier this year, he said: ""Don't let anyone tell you the 2008 crisis ended and that now you have a new one. ""That crisis never ended. It just moved in different forms, travelled from one continent to another. ""But nevertheless it has always been with us. ""The world never went back to some kind of equilibrium after 2008. ""What coronavirus has done, it has deepened and accelerated this never-ending non-stop crisis that began in 2008.""

Mr Varoufakis also shed light on why he thinks the world was presented with the illusion of a recovery after 2011. He added: ""They printed trillions and trillions of notes and threw them at the 0.1 percent at corporations that were already full of money. For example, Apple, Google and so on. ""They boosted inequality massively and stabilised financial markets. But at the same time, they depleted all serious investments in good quality jobs in labour, health, education. ""This is why there has been so much discontent even before COVID-19 arrived on the scene."
879,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions several actors, such as Jacques Chirac, Saddam Hussein, Tony Blair, and Dominque de Villepin.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by various actors, such as selling nuclear reactors, supporting Saddam Hussein, and giving speeches at the UN Security Council.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"In truth, though, this is not one of the British author’s better works. It is an undemanding, unchallenging read which offers very little in the way of new insights and fails to present anything like a rounded picture of the war and its causes.

At times, Allies reads like a hastily-assembled piece of neoconservative propaganda. Those who opposed the war are dismissed out of hand for their “glib and hypocritical slogans” and for closing their minds “to the real dilemmas that the proliferation of WMD raised”. (What WMD?).

Although the subtitle refers to the ‘US, Britain and Europe’, the latter hardly gets a look in – apart from France and, in particular, Jacques Chirac, whom Shawcross attacks savagely throughout.

He traces Chirac’s relationship with Saddam Hussein back to 1974 and the signing of an agreement to sell French nuclear reactors to Iraq. As part of the deal, France agreed to train 600 Iraqi nuclear technicians and scientists. “Even the Kremlin turned down Saddam’s request,” sneers Shawcross.

Chirac is ridiculed for his flattery of Saddam as “a personal friend and a great statesman”and for trying to later deflect criticism of this misjudgement onto the then president of France, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.

In contrast, Shawcross – the son of Nuremberg war crimes prosecutor Hartley Shawcross – glosses over America’s support for Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war.

Instead, the author returns again and again to what he sees as the dishonest and duplicitous approach of France both before, during and after the war.

“Effrontery might well have been Jacques Chirac’s middle name in the fall of 2002 when he had the temerity to ask Tony Blair how he would justify a war in Iraq to his two-year-old son Leo. A preposterous question – it would be much easier for Blair to do this than it would for Chirac to justify to his own grandchildren his own long and shabby relationship with Saddam Hussein,” he writes.

Nor is he a fan of Dominque de Villepin, the French foreign minister. Shawcross describes him as “a man who seemed to adore himself rather more than was appropriate”.

De Villepin’s impassioned speech to the UN Security Council on 14 February, calling for an extension of the weapons’ inspectors mandate, was greeted by applause in the chamber – virtually unheard of. Shawcross, however, sees the speech as a “bald-faced attempt to play to the gallery of the world” and one that “guaranteed the fracturing of UN consensus”.

Warming to his anti-Franco/anti-EU theme, he insists that “France’s ambition, endorsed by many senior EU officials, that Europe should make itself a ‘counter weight’ or rival to the United States is a vanity, a delusion that can only weaken the defences of the world”.

Shawcross is, however, on stronger ground when he argues that the pressure from France and Germany for a quick handover of power to the Iraqis might be “unwise and dangerous”.

“Why should such speed be forced upon Iraq? The UN had occupied Bosnia for seven years before giving the locals power; it has been occupying Kosovo for four years; and Sergio Vieira de Mello [the UN representativewho was tragically killed in a suicide bomb attack on Baghdad’s Canal Hotel on 19 August] had ruled East Timor for two years before the territory won its independence,” he points out.

Put that way, it does seem a reasonable argument. Moreover, if the Iraqis were in full control now, Saddam Hussein would have probably been tried and executed within 48 hours of his capture.

Shawcross doesn’t let the US totally off the hook for its mistakes before and after the war.

Early in the book, he describes how General Norman Schwarzkopf blundered during the ceasefire talks at Safwan in March 1991, after the first Gulf War, when he acceded to a request by the Iraqi representative, General Sultan Hasim Ahmad, for permission to allow Iraqi officials to be ferried around the country in armed helicopters. The Iraqis claimed they needed air transport because the coalition forces had destroyed so many roads and bridges. Schwarzkopf “unwittingly allowed the terror to begin” because the helicopters were used by Saddam’s henchmen to put down the Shia uprising in the south.

Shawcross also criticizes the Pentagon, saying it was clear from mid-May that it had put far too little thought into the postwar administration of Iraq.

That aside, if the White House were a publishing house, the president would be happy enough for Allies to carry its imprint."

Pioneering whistleblower laws were passed by the Continental Congress in 1778, and by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, at the height of the Civil War.

Who should be TIME’s Person of the Year for 2019? Cast your vote in the reader poll.

But as important and effective as whistleblowing has become today, its rise is actually bad news for American society in the long term– a symptom of the breakdown of internal checks and balances on our corporations and our government. This current spate of high-level disclosures by whistleblowers coincides with the spread of cultures of secrecy, of outsourcing public goods and services to private contractors, of increasing normalization of conflict of interest and other unethical practices as clever business models, and the weakening of the very concept of public service itself. Watchdogs are disappearing, as regulators are captured, defunded or drowned out by lobbying, as local newspapers cut their staffs, and with fewer attorneys at the Department of Justice willing or able to prosecute white collar criminals. Corporate and government insiders realize that if they don’t speak out, no one will ever learn of the wrongdoing they see.

We publicly celebrate whistleblowers in the news and in films as heroes, but in real life we allow most of them to be permanently blackballed in their chosen fields. This two-faced view toward people with the rare courage to speak truth to power suggests why whistleblowing is so alarmingly easy to politicize. And since the basic currency of whistleblowing is a respect for facts and the rule of law, the act of whistleblowing, like democracy itself, is at hazard in today’s postfact world.

The words will remain, but in a different calligraphic form. That may not seem like a big change, but for many Iraqis it makes a world of difference.

The old calligraphy was based on Saddam Hussein's own handwriting, and for many who suffered most under his iron fist  especially the Kurds  the flag came to symbolize his repressive rule. As I look at the Iraqi flag hanging on the wall in my office in New York, I can understand their resentment. Even holy words can seem profane when they are uttered (or, in this case, written) by the embodiment of evil.

I remember how I came into possession of the flag: it had a great deal to do with Kurdish resentment, and it nearly got a young American soldier in deep trouble.

It was April 10, 2003, the day after Baghdad fell. Late in the afternoon, I made my way to Saddam's main palace in the city: There had been some silly rumors that the Americans were preparing to blast it into rubble. I found a small group of American soldiers combing through the vast palace (it would later house the U.S. embassy), looking for documents. Many Iraqis  who were never allowed near the palace during Saddam's reign  had gathered at the main entrance. Many were there out of idle curiosity, and some were cheering the Americans.

I was in Saddam's own office when an American soldier grabbed one of the flags hanging next to the dictator's desk and, pointing on the lettering, asked his Kurdish translator, ""What does this say?"" The translator replied, with obvious disgust, ""It says 'Saddam Hussein.'""

He wasn't being literal, of course, but the soldier didn't know that. He took the flag out to the main entrance of the palace, where a group of Iraqis had gathered. He held the flag up high with one hand, and reached into his pocket with his other hand and pulled out a Zippo lighter. He had a triumphant look in his face as he announced, ""This is what we'll do to Saddam!""

The crowd was aghast  none of them understood English, so all they could see was an American soldier about to set alight their national flag. Some of them shouted at the soldier, but he seemed to mistake their anger for enthusiasm. He held the flag up higher, and fired up the Zippo.

I reached out and grabbed the soldier's hand, and pulled the lighter away from the flag. ""What are you doing?"" I asked.

""Frying Saddam's ass,"" he said, still smiling broadly. He pointed to the lettering and said, ""It says 'Saddam Hussein.'""

I told him what the lettering really said, and he looked over at the crowd of now hostile Iraqis. He turned pale. ""Oh s--t man, I didn't know"" he said. ""Can you explain that to them?"" He thrust the flag into my hands and ran back indoors. So there I was, holding Saddam's flag and facing an angry Iraqi mob. I could sense that their resentment at the soldier was being transferred to me.

Luckily, my translator had a booming voice, and he shouted at the crowd to calm down. He explained that it had all been a big mistake, the soldier had not intended to insult their national flag, he had merely been misinformed by his Kurdish translator. To my relief, the Iraqis were mollified. Some laughed, others made wisecracks about Kurds.

Relieved, I handed the flag to an old man in the crowd  he was dressed like a tribal sheikh and had a kindly, weathered face. Through my translator, I told him that the flag belonged to Iraq, not Saddam. The old man turned to his neighbors and had a quick, whispered conversation. Then he gave the flag back to me. ""You saved the flag,"" he said, in Arabic. ""So you should have it.""

That's how Saddam Hussein's flag came to be on my wall. It may bear the dictator's evil imprint, but it reminds me of a brief moment when Iraqis were able to put Saddam behind them and look forward to a better life."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

The armed North Carolina man who traveled to a Washington D.C. pizzeria this weekend while self-investigating an wild internet conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton surrendered to authorities when his search yielded no evidence, according to court documents released Monday.

Edgar Welch, 28, was arraigned Monday on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license and other crimes, the documents say.

The documents allege that Welch, whose address is listed 250 miles south, in Durham, N.C., arrived at the pizzeria, Comet Ping Pong, armed with an AR-15 rifle and a .38 caliber handgun just after 3 p.m. to help “rescue” child sex slaves that he believed were possibly being held there.

At the pizzeria on Sunday, a worker told police that he was outside when Welch apparently arrived. Identified only as CW-1 in the documents, the worker said that he stepped out to grab pizza dough when he heard three loud bangs coming from inside.

“CW-1 re-entered the restaurant and observed a white male holding an AR-15 type rifle,” the documents say, adding that when Welch allegedly swung the rifle towards him he immediately ran outside.

There, another person who had been in Comet was shouting: “He’s in there and he has a gun,” the documents say.

No one was injured in the incident, and by 3:15 p.m., a police barricade had been set up outside of Comet. Nine minutes after that, Welch set his guns down and walked outside with his hands raised, the documents say.

When a sergeant asked about motive, Welch “stated that he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that the wanted to see for himself if they were there,"" according to the documents.

The documents say that Welch then “surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant.”

On Sunday, Alefantis offered up Welch's actions as the logical but grim conclusion of fake news, telling reporters: ""What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theory does come with consequences.""

The roots of the so-called “PizzaGate” fake conspiracy theory can be traced to the email hacking of Hillary Clinton’s former presidential campaign chair, John Podesta, the New York Times reported last month.

Podesta casually knows the restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, the Times reported, and an email between the two about a fundraiser became the source of rampant, unfounded speculation among users of the message board 4Chan, who believed that high-level Democrats were operating a child abuse ring there.

Even though there was no evidence to support those claims, which Alefantis has emphatically denied, the theory was peddled on Reddit, Facebook and elsewhere."

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, entered the crowded Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Dec. 4, fired an AR-15 rifle several times and pointed it in the direction of an employee who fled in fear, according to authorities.

The indictment charges him with assault with a dangerous weapon, interstate transportation of a firearm to commit a crime and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence.

A lawyer for Welch could not immediately be reached for comment.

Welch, of Salisbury, North Carolina, is scheduled to appear in court on Friday, a spokesman for prosecutors said.

Welch told authorities he wanted to free children from a pedophilia ring that conspiracy websites said 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ran out of the restaurant.

He planned the raid for days and tried to rally friends to the attack, asking them to watch a YouTube video about the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, according to federal court documents filed on Tuesday.

No one was hurt in the shooting, although the stories about Comet Ping Pong have prompted threats against the business and its employees."

Around 1960 the Sunday Express mentioned it again and then again between 1980 and 1986. This time there was mention of Ford cars being interested and even declaring there would be a water-powered car engine by 1996. Then the story disappeared again - permanently.



It could well be such a discovery would spell ruin for Big Oil and their many billions in profits. Perhaps a water-powered engine was simply a discovery too far.

""We remove misinformation that could cause harm to an individual's health or wider public safety. We also remove content distributed by disinformation campaigns,"" TikTok, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, wrote in new guidelines which expand and add detail to its earlier rules.

TikTok, as a relative newcomer to the social media landscape, has yet to wrestle publicly with the persistent content moderation scandals that have dogged larger and more entrenched competitors.

However, the company has grown rapidly over the last year and come under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers concerned that it may be censoring politically sensitive content, following reports it blocked videos on protests in Hong Kong.

U.S. officials have also raised national security concerns about TikTok's handling of user data, prompting reviews by the U.S. Army and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. TikTok says it stores U.S. user data outside China.

According to data from research firm Sensor Tower, TikTok and its Chinese counterpart Douyin have been downloaded more than 1.5 billion times, including 680 million downloads in 2019.

TikTok's previous rules around ""misleading content"" appeared to focus mostly on scams, barring users from creating fake identities or posting false information to make money, but did not mention misinformation or disinformation campaigns.

By contrast, the new rules explicitly ban ""misinformation meant to incite fear, hate, or prejudice,"" ""misleading information about medical treatments,"" and ""content that misleads community members about elections or other civic processes.""

The guidelines did not explain how TikTok would determine what constitutes ""misleading"" content and appeared to leave leeway for interpretation in enforcement decisions.

A spokesman said the new policy would likely prompt the removal of content featuring conspiracy theories like Pizzagate, a fictitious story involving child exploitation and a supposedly Clinton-linked Washington pizzeria which went viral on social media in 2016 and prompted a man to fire an assault rifle at the pizzeria.

The spokesman said TikTok would also consider a heavily edited video that attempted to make U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi seem incoherent to be misinformation. Facebook and Twitter weathered intense criticism from Democrats over the video this year after declining to take it down.

On Monday, Facebook announced a new policy banning deepfakes and other manipulated media, but said the change would not result in the removal of the doctored Pelosi video."

The core symptoms are distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience. These symptoms can undermine the work of an otherwise gifted executive.

As our minds fill with noise—feckless synaptic events signifying nothing—the brain gradually loses its capacity to attend fully and thoroughly to anything.

The symptoms of ADT come upon a person gradually. The sufferer doesn’t experience a single crisis but rather a series of minor emergencies while he or she tries harder and harder to keep up. Shouldering a responsibility to “suck it up” and not complain as the workload increases, executives with ADT do whatever they can to handle a load they simply cannot manage as well as they’d like. The ADT sufferer, therefore, feels a constant low level of panic and guilt. Facing a tidal wave of tasks, the executive becomes increasingly hurried, curt, peremptory, and unfocused, while pretending that everything is fine.

The technology has soared in popularity over the past year as the price of Bitcoin soared to almost $20,000.

Part of the appeal of the digital cash is the anonymity it grants holders. It uses decentralised technology for secure payments and storing money that doesn't require banks or people's names.

Yet “QAnon: An Invitation to the Great Awakening,” a book pushing wacky conspiracy theories, has become an Amazon AMZN, best seller, cracking the top 75 among books sold on the site in recent days, according to NBC News.

The book, which says it was written by a dozen “anonymous Q followers, decoders and citizen journalists known collectively as Where We Go One We Go All (WWG1WGA),” claims that Democrats murder and eat children and that the government created AIDS, polio and Lyme disease. Then there’s the belief that the world is run by a Satanic cabal led by Hillary Clinton.

There’s more. So much more. But we’ll leave it there.

QAnon emerged from the dark corners of the internet and into the national spotlight thanks primarily to supporters of Donald Trump who would show up at his rallies wearing clothes and holding signs referencing the “Q” conspiracy.

Mike Rothschild, a conspiracy-theory expert, told NBC that the book is just another way for the QAnon movement to cash in on its gullible followers, calling it “a bold new step in the endless grift at the heart of Q.”

Nevertheless, the book keeps selling and racking up questionable glowing reviews, which Jason Kint, CEO of the trade association Digital Content Next, chalks up to manipulation and the lack of oversight on Amazon’s part.

“To be clear, they absolutely shouldn’t be censoring the availability of books like this,” Kite explained to NBC. “But the fact we’re left only with the publisher’s own description of the book and a clearly gamed set of 5-star reviews — how is the average shopper supposed to know this is toxic garbage?”"

On the morning of June 17, 1972, five men were arrested after breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. The media, led by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, doggedly pursued the story, exposing wiretaps, secret documents, and hush money. President Richard Nixon denied involvement in the scandal, declaring, “I am not a crook,” in a nationally televised press conference. But the White House cover-up failed. Faced with almost certain impeachment, Nixon resigned from his second term in office on August 9, 1974.

The White Sox shocked the nation when they threw the World Series. Nearly a century ago, some members of the Chicago White Sox baseball team accepted a bribe—as much as $100,000 (about $1.4 million today)—to deliberately lose the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. Suspicions arose in the first game after uncharacteristically sloppy pitching by the White Sox, who were heavily favored to win. “I don’t know why I did it,” pitcher Eddie Cicotte testified before a grand jury. “I must have been crazy.” He and seven other players, including “Shoeless” Joe Jackson, were indicted on nine counts of conspiracy but acquitted by a jury. They were banned from the game for life.

Many made claims to be the grand duchess of Russia, but all of them were frauds. It was a gruesome crime: In 1918 Bolshevik revolutionaries executed Russian tsar Nicholas II, the empress, and their five children. But did Anastasia, the youngest daughter, escape? Several impersonators exploited this hope, most famously Anna Anderson, an Anastasia look-alike who filed an unsuccessful suit in 1938 to try to prove her identity—and claim an inheritance. Anderson, who had supporters as well as detractors, died in 1984. A posthumous DNA test found she was unrelated to the Romanovs and appeared to confirm she was a Polish factory worker named Franziska Schanzkowska.

A famous swindler lends his name to a fraudulent scheme that still endures. In 1919 Italian immigrant Charles Ponzi built a pyramid scheme around international postal reply coupons. Ponzi, who brought in $250,000 a day at the peak of his scheme (about three million dollars today), conned investors into sending him millions of dollars, promising eye-popping returns. Ponzi’s scam—paying one investor with money from others—unraveled in August 1920, when he was charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. In 2008 modern-day Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff was arrested after bilking investors—including Steven Spielberg, Sandy Koufax, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Elie Wiesel—out of billions.

A gifted showman, P. T. Barnum exploited the public’s desire to be amazed. At his first spectacle, in 1835, showman Phineas Taylor Barnum touted Joice Heth as George Washington’s 161-year-old nursemaid. Crowds came gawking to see “the greatest natural & national curiosity in the world.” Barnum profited from the public’s hunger for entertainment by planting embellishments and lies in newspapers. His fabrication about Heth blew up after her death, when an autopsy found her to be no more than 80 years old. Barnum’s flair for fake news culminated when, in ill health, he arranged for the publication of his own obituary so he could read it before he died.

Piltdown man, a clever fabrication of a human ancestor, created a sensation. In 1912 fossil enthusiast Charles Dawson and his collaborator Arthur Smith Woodward, a geologist at the British Natural History Museum, announced the unearthing of humanlike skull fragments and an apelike jawbone from a gravel pit near Piltdown, England. Just a few years earlier, Dawson had written to Smith Woodward, saying he was “waiting for the big ‘find.’ ” But Piltdown man, initially hailed as the missing link connecting ape to human, was a fraud: The bones were stained to resemble ancient fossils, and the teeth, from an orangutan, had been filed down to appear human."

Nor, it seems, did God spare Billie Eilish.

The 17-year-old pop star’s unsettling new video finds her a fallen angel, ejected from Heaven and landing on Earth to find it a deserted, fiery hellscape. “Peter’s on vacation, an open invitation,” she sings, against jaunty keys, suggesting that “even God herself … will want the Devil on her team”.

Tarred and feathered, Eilish eventually goes up in flames herself as, in the background, silhouetted women dance sexily, like the singers she has deliberately positioned herself against. The video for the single all the good girls go to hell (the insistently nonchalant lower-case formatting is hers) has amassed 37m views in just five days, reflective of the controversy the clip has caused in corners of the internet.

On the Q&A website Quora, a conflicted fan fretted: “Can I be a good Christian and like Billie Eilish’s new music?” On Twitter, a woman responded to Eilish’s share of the video, saying: “Prayers sent.” “Nobody asked for your prayers, Tina” came another fan’s retort.

Pop stars playing with religious iconography is hardly a new idea: in March, Madonna marked the 30th anniversary of the Like a Prayer video, wherein she danced in front of burning crosses, kissed a black saint and caused so much controversy she claims it cost her a multi-million-dollar deal with Pepsi.

More recently, Lady Gaga portrayed herself as Mary Magdalene in the video for Judas, released close to Holy Week and Easter 2011, though Gaga said it was not a purposeful attack on religion: “The only controversial thing about this video is that I’m wearing Christian Lacroix and Chanel in the same frame,” she joked to E!.

In July, the SoundCloud rapper Lil Uzi Vert invoked the Rapture during his set at Wireless festival in London, telling his fans that they were “going to Hell” with him and that his hit XO Tour Llif3 was “what it’s going to sound like for eternity”.

Far from becoming immune to the shock tactics, however, some Christians seem to find Eilish’s embrace of Satanic imagery especially concerning in light of her tender years. To quote from the Everyday Christian Parent blog: “Satan no longer hides, and kids think its [sic] cool. … Contrary to Billie Eilish’s songs of hopelessness, we have hope in Jesus.”

A closer reading of Eilish’s lyrics suggests the outrage is misplaced: hills are burning in California, sea levels are rising, the Pearly Gates are a picket fence – far from idolising the devil, Eilish has confirmed the song is largely about the threat from the climate crisis.

“The world’s being ruined by us, you know – it’s literally us,” she said of the song in an interview. And all the good girls will find themselves in Hell along with the bad girls when it eventually comes to Earth.

Those looking for hope after watching Eilish’s video on YouTube might have found it in the description, where she has posted a personal note urging fans to take part in the global climate strikes on 20 and 27 September. The top tag is #climatestrike.

And so Eilish’s glory is revealed – praise be to Billie."

However, experts say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh this small risk.

In the study, researchers examined information collected from the administration of 1.2 million doses of RotaTeq, the most common rotavirus vaccine used in the United States, and more than 100,000 doses of Rotarix, another rotavirus vaccine licensed for use in the U.S. (The rotavirus vaccination is given as a two- or three-shot series to infants ages 2 to 6 months.) [5 Dangerous Vaccination Myths]

The researchers found that during the three weeks after vaccination, the RotaTeq vaccine was linked with about 15 extra cases of intussusception per 1 million vaccinated infants, or one case per 65,000 doses given, the study found. There were not enough infants vaccinated with Rotarix to adequately determine whether that vaccine was linked with an increased risk of intussusception.

Intussusception is a condition in which one part of the intestine slides over another part in a ""telescoping"" manner, resulting in bowel blockage.

A previous version of the rotavirus vaccine, called RotaShield, was withdrawn from the market in 1999 after it was linked with an increased risk of intussusception (about one to two cases per 10,000 people vaccinated).

In the mid-2000s, RotaTeq and Rotarix were licensed following large clinical trials that found no increased risk of intussusception linked with the vaccines. But health officials continued to monitor outcomes of vaccination, and some other recent studies have suggested an increased risk of intussusception after vaccination with these vaccines.

Study researcher Katherine Yih, of Harvard Medical School, said parents should be aware that ""the chances of their child getting this outcome is small.""

Yih said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reviewed the latest research and determined that the benefits of the rotavirus vaccine still outweigh the risks. A 2011 study found the rotavirus vaccine prevented 65,000 U.S. children from being hospitalized with rotavirus since 2006.

Still, Yih noted for intussusception, ""the risk isn't zero."" Parents should watch for signs of severe abdominal pain in their children during the first week after vaccination, Yih said.

The study is published online (Jan. 14) in the New England Journal of Medicine."

Doctors previously recommended the two vaccines be given weeks apart. But a new, six-year study published Wednesday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology reports that getting the shots at the same time is just as safe as spacing them out.

The researchers analyzed data on 36,844 women, ages 14 to 49, who received flu and whooping cough vaccines during pregnancy between 2007 and 2013. In 23 percent of pregnancies the vaccines were given at the same time and in the other 77 percent the vaccines were administered at separate times.

Vaccine research scientist and study co-author Marlene Lugg said they found no significant increased risk of fever or other adverse effects to mother or baby.

""There was no difference in early birth, low birth weight, in any of the babies' outcomes,"" said Lugg.

Dr. Richard Beigi, Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Medical Affairs at Magee-Womens Hospital at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, told CBS News there was no reason to believe getting the two vaccines together would be unsafe in pregnant women, but it had never been addressed before in research.

""This study is reassuring in that it involved thousands of women at multiple centers,"" said Beigi, who is also a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. ""It validates what we've already known for years but it's really nice to see this. It provides reassurance that when you give them together it's very safe. There's no signal in study that would be of concern for an OB care provider.""

Beigi said this study doesn't delve into how the vaccines impact the unborn baby after birth, but he said, ""There's no reason to believe there would be an issue.""

He said research suggests that if you immunize a mother with the flu vaccine it protects the baby as well. ""Numerous studies show immunizing the mother protects the baby.""

Pregnant women who catch the flu are at risk for serious complications and hospitalization, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Beigi said it's not clear why they're more vulnerable but it may be linked to immunological or anatomical changes during pregnancy.

Lugg said pregnant women need to ""understand that it's extremely safe and it protects them and the baby.""

Protection against whooping cough is also important for pregnant women and others who spend time around newborns since the illness can be extremely serious for infants.

Expectant mom Emily Whitehead, 32, is due in seven weeks and said she plans to get vaccinated against flu and whooping cough. The DTaP vaccine includes tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough.

""We definitely are mindful about vaccinations. I've heard that the whooping cough is, like, a really good one to get,"" she said."

Ordinary hardworking Joes (and Josefs) watched as one company after another got bailed out by governments while they got little, if any, help with their own economic struggles. ""I've had lots of conversations with very, very senior bankers in the last couple of years who said, 'Look, we didn't suffer enough pain. We did wrong, but we didn't get punished,'"" said Arif Naqvi, CEO of the investment firm Abraaj Capital, based in the United Arab Emirates.

That's a sentiment large sectors of the developed world understand very well, which is why politicians across the rich world are finding an appeal in populism and why bankers need to understand where it comes from. Those in the banking community who opposed the proposed reforms of the Obama Administration, megainvestor George Soros told a lunch later that day, were ""tone-deaf.""

Anger and resentment, however, are rarely sensible drivers of policy  especially in an area as complex as financial-market reform and regulation. Taking back fat-cat banker bonuses plays well on Main Street, but it's not a particularly meaningful structural change if what you're going for is preventing the next near collapse of the financial system. Bringing transparency to the shadow banking system is more difficult to wedge into a sound bite  Heizo Takenaka of Keio University in Japan said the need to regulate the shadow banking system was one of the key lessons of his time as a policymaker  but it would be a wiser goal.

Or consider the movement now afoot, thanks to the so-called Volcker rule, to impose size limits on banks as well as prohibit deposit-taking banks from trading on their own accounts. At first blush, that seems like a simple and sensible policy solution, said Rajan. The problem: a quick look at history shows that the sheer size of banks isn't necessarily the culprit. In the 1930s  a time when thousands of small, local banks were going under across the U.S.  the problem was not ""too big to fail"" but ""too many to fail."" The right policy solution almost certainly exists deep in the weeds. Yet the more policy is driven by politicians trying to appeal to the (rightfully) outraged crowd, the less room there's likely to be for nuance. ""In the democratic process, the support of the general public is very much needed,"" said Takenaka. ""The education of the general public is indispensable.""

And here's one of the more difficult lessons to teach: how to coordinate an international response for regulatory change. ""In the long run,"" said Soros, ""you can't have global markets without global regulation."" That doesn't mean getting there is easy. International cooperation can quickly fall afoul of national politicians anxious to preserve  or at least appear to preserve  sovereignty. And as we have been reminded in the wake of crisis, institutions like the G-20 find it difficult to make even the simplest proposals stick. ""At the World Economic Forum,"" said Rubenstein, ""you should always say, 'Yes, multilateralism is possible, and we should come together.' But getting national solutions is difficult enough.""

Those difficulties suffused the mood in Davos. It's a certain type of person who comes to this spectacular valley  surrounded by steep mountains, bitterly cold at night. And even those hardy souls this year kept a lucky rabbit's foot in their pocket. ""I think most people who find their way to Davos are just naturally optimistic,"" said Naqvi. ""But we've been through such a massive shock in the global system that we can't expect to recover from it overnight.""

All of Disney's ""cast members,"" as it calls park employees, have been offered immunity tests and vaccinations since the company first heard of the outbreak Jan. 7, Hymel said. Those who have been in close contact with infected employees are put on paid leave until their immunity can be established.

Of the five employees at Disneyland and Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, three have fully recovered and returned to work, and two remain off, said Dr. Pamela Hymel, the chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

A recent measles outbreak traced to Disney theme parks in California includes five park employees who were infected, officials said Tuesday.

Oregon became the latest state affected Tuesday when state officials confirmed that a Eugene man in his 40s had contracted the disease after visiting Disney parks.

Orange County has confirmed 18 cases there in the past month, though six were not connected to the theme parks, said its health agency spokeswoman Deanne Thompson.

At nearby Huntington Beach High School, at least 23 unvaccinated students have been sent home after a student was confirmed to be infected with measles.

Students without a measles vaccination were told to stay home until Jan. 29 to avoid a spread of the disease that has symptoms including fever and a blotchy body rash.

State law requires schoolchildren to get vaccinated to protect against measles, mumps and rubella, but parents can get an exemption by signing a personal belief waiver.

Many parents who reject vaccines or delay them fear there are links between the vaccines and medical conditions such as autism. Numerous studies have dismissed an autism link.

""It is at large in the community now, and particularly infants too young to be immunized, people with other health conditions and, of course, people who aren't immunized need to be very concerned,"" Thompson said.

She added that unvaccinated people ""really should rethink that and consider getting vaccinated."""

The new figures are up from the statistics reported this time last week, with 135 fatalities reported last Thursday.

⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates

And the Department of Health today confirmed there had been 1,118 new infections recorded in the past 24 hours.

England today recorded another 55 deaths, including patients aged between 49 and 98-years-old.

Scotland reported another two corona deaths, bringing the total to 2,482.

Meanwhile in Wales, the death toll rose by six to 1,497.

Figures yesterday revealed 154 more people had died from the deadly bug.

It comes as...
• Brits will be able to jet off to safe holiday spots next week
• Families are booking UK holidays ever 11 seconds after the easing of lockdown was announced
• The coronavirus R rate could be above crucial one in England
• There are plans to double the pupil ""bubble cap"" to 30 and scrap social distancing inside classrooms

And despite hopes that millions of antibody tests bought by the British government will be ""game changing"", some doctors have flagged concerns they ""can't be trusted"".

Last month the government purchased 10 million of the test kits from Abbott and Roche after studies from Public Health England found they were effective.

Now in a letter to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) a group of physicians and senior clinical academics have claimed there is no valid clinical reason for the large scale testing which is being carried out.

Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the NHS test-and-trace-programme said not enough is known about the level of protection such tests provide.

This is while Professor Jon Deeks, who led the first systematic review of studies on Covid antibody tests said: ""We don't have much data and we can't trust any of it.""

Meanwhile, leaked documents have suggested the coronavirus R rate could be above the crucial threshold of 1 in England.

Sage said last week that across the UK, the average Covid reproduction number is 0.7 to 0.9.

When the value is below one, it means transmission of the virus is no longer high and the epidemic is shrinking.

But an ""officially sensitive"" PHE document, seen by HuffPost UK, suggests officials aren't convinced the R rate is below one across the country.

It states: ""Current estimates of R is currently estimated to be below 1, in most regions at around 0.9, although there is uncertainty around these and thus and thus we cannot preclude R being above 1."""

The European Central Bank just announced it will be expanding its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion and kept interest rates unchanged. This is €100 billion more than investors were expecting. The duration of PEPP has also been extended to at least the end of June 2021 and purchases will continue ""until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over."" The central bank has ramped up its other bond-buying programs and usual lending to banks by €630 billion since March, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics﻿﻿.

The European Central Bank also said headline inflation was expected to be 0.3% in 2020 and 0.8% in 2021 — well below the bank’s mandate to drive inflation “close but below 2%”. GDP is expected to decline by 8.7% this year, before rebounding to 5.2% growth in 2021 and 3.3% in 2022. ECB President Lagarde last week ruled out the ""mild"" scenario (5% GDP decline) for 2020 and said we're likely to see output reduce according to the ""medium"" or ""severe"" scenarios (8-12% decline).

The pandemic poses a unique threat to the European Union and the Eurozone. A recovery fund proposed by the executive branch of the EU is being opposed by certain less-affected, ""frugal"" countries that don't want to share debt or give grants to the needy ones instead of loans. The ECB's bond-buying program faced flak from Germany's highest court last month. It demanded that the German government and central bank force the ECB to prove it is necessary and does not violate the principle of proportionality (weighing the costs and benefits). While it has no jurisdiction over the ECB, the court can affect the Bundesbank's participation. It can also inspire other nation's judiciaries in the euro area to question the ECB's credibility in a similar way.

Brexit trade talks aren't going so well. The two regions have until the end of the year to strike a new deal, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure to extend the deadline. According to Germany’s ambassador to the EU, Michael Clauss, negotiators have made ""no real progress."" ""Is a deal possible? Yes, definitely,"" he said at a European Policy Centre event yesterday. ""But I think it also means that the U.K. needs to have a more realistic approach. To put it short: I think we cannot have full sovereignty and at the same time full access to the internal market. So this Brexit issue is going to absorb a lot of political or most of the political attention we expect in September and October."" A current big issue being discussed is fish quota i.e. whether European companies can access U.K. waters to fish."

Most U.S. public-policy debates, on matters including education reform and social mobility, occur in a bizarre vacuum, as if the encounters (good and bad) of the large majority of humankind with these same challenges yield no useful insights for the United States. On the rare occasions that politicians do invoke the policies of other governments, they often wield them as political props during highly polarized debates over issues such as health care and gun control.

And many American politicians, especially those on the right, have in recent years paradoxically doubled down on American exceptionalism (we have a president who ran on an “America first” platform, after all) even as American power has declined relative to other countries’.

This kind of insularity might have been “relatively harmless when America bestrode the world like a colossus, but it’s dangerous when the country faces a raft of global challenges from China, to climate, to COVID-19,” Dominic Tierney, a political-science professor at Swarthmore College (and a former contributing editor at The Atlantic), told me by email.

Pandemics are, in fact, particularly ripe moments for cross-cultural learning. Consider, for instance, the face mask. As Christos Lynteris, a medical anthropologist at the University of St Andrews relayed to me, face masks were invented during a 1910 outbreak of the pneumonic plague in Manchuria, by a Chinese doctor named Wu Liande, who was inspired by surgical masks he’d seen while studying in England. They caught on, in Wu’s telling, because of a fateful refusal to learn from others: Only after a French doctor who had declined to cover his face while treating patients died were the masks widely adopted.

Today, in the case of COVID-19, “all states face the same essential threat, and each government’s response is a kind of laboratory experiment,” Tierney said.

“The United States had the advantage of being struck relatively late by the virus, and this gave [us] a priceless chance to copy best practices and avoid the mistakes of others,” he noted.

Instead, the United States squandered that advantage on many fronts. The Obama administration had developed a playbook for pandemic response that drew in part on lessons from other countries’ experiences, but the Trump administration disregarded it. When China began confining millions of people to their homes in January, the U.S. government should have gotten the message that the Chinese were grappling with a grave threat to the wider world, the Yale sociologist and physician Nicholas Christakis told me in March. “We lost six weeks” in the United States to prepare—“to build ventilators, get protective equipment, organize our ICUs, get tests ready, prepare the public for what was going to happen so that our economy didn’t tank as badly. None of this was done adequately by our leaders.” By one estimate, from the epidemiologists Britta L. Jewell and Nicholas P. Jewell, if social-distancing policies had been implemented just two weeks earlier in March, 90 percent of the cumulative coronavirus deaths in the United States during the first wave of the pandemic might have been prevented."

""Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery,"" Obama said.

Obama praised Biden for his efforts during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, helping ""to prevent the Ebola epidemic from becoming the type of pandemic we're seeing now.""

While Obama's lengthy statement never addressed President Donald Trump by name, the remarks centered around the need for strong, principled leadership in the White House – especially in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic .

""Choosing Joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made, and he became a close friend. And I believe Joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now,"" Obama said in a video posted to Twitter.

Former President Barack Obama endorsed Joe Biden, his two-term vice president, on Tuesday morning in the race for the White House.

Biden said in a tweet that Obama's endorsement ""means the world to Jill and me. We're going to build on the progress we made together, and there's no one I'd rather have standing by my side.""

""There is no better partner in the battle for the soul of this nation, and no one I'd rather have standing by my side,"" Biden said in a statement later Tuesday. ""We need to restore the qualities of presidential leadership President Obama provided — and that is what I intend to do.""

The endorsement came only after Biden emerged as the last candidate left standing in the Democratic primary to take on Trump in November. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist from Vermont and Biden's final opponent, dropped out last week and endorsed his former rival on Monday.

In his speech, Obama extended an olive branch to Sanders.

""Bernie's an American original – a man who has devoted his life to giving voice to working people's hopes, dreams, and frustrations,"" Obama said. ""He and I haven't always agreed on everything, but we've always shared a conviction that we have to make America a fairer, more just, more equitable society.""

Obama's decision to steer largely clear of the primary fight raised eyebrows among some political watchers, who questioned why the 44th president did not immediately offer his endorsement when Biden launched his campaign.

Biden said at that time that he asked Obama ""not to endorse"" him.

""Whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merit,"" the former vice president said.

Biden was considered the clear frontrunner. But his momentum slowed as the competitive nominating contest wore on, and he fell well behind Sanders in the polls following the first few primary elections.

A crucial endorsement in February from Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, the influential House majority whip, marked a major shift back to the top of the field for Biden, who won the South Carolina primary with resounding support from the state's highly diverse electorate.

""Now that Biden is the only candidate left in the Democrat field, Obama has no other choice but to support him. Even Bernie Sanders beat him to it,"" campaign boss Brad Parscale said in a statement.

In the 2016 election, Obama did not endorse Hillary Clinton – his former secretary of State – until June, when she had secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. Clinton lost to Republican nominee Trump in November 2016.

But Obama's popularity has grown since leaving the White House – a fact evident in polls and in the rhetoric of many former Democratic presidential candidates, who regularly praised Obama's achievements in office.

In his endorsement, the former president advocated for a progressive approach to the 2020 election

""If I were running today, I wouldn't run the same race or have the same platform as I did in 2008. The world is different; there's too much unfinished business for us to just look backwards. We have to look to the future,"" Obama said.

""Bernie understands that. And Joe understands that. It's one of the reasons that Joe already has what is the most progressive platform of any major party nominee in history,"" Obama said. ""Because even before the pandemic turned the world upside down, it was already clear that we needed real structural change.""

Obama said that the Affordable Care Act, the signature legislative achievement of his presidency, should be expanded to provide a public and expand Medicare. He also said that America should return to the Paris climate agreement, from which Trump withdrew the U.S.

""Our country's future hangs on this election. And it won't be easy,"" Obama said. ""The other side has a massive war chest. The other side has a propaganda network with little regard for the truth.""

Since Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have maintained a consistent, and tightly controlled, public presence.

Obama's official Twitter account remains wildly popular, boasting more than 30 million more followers than Trump's handle despite the current president's more frequent use of the platform.

The Obamas have branched out into other popular media, as well. In May 2018, they signed a multiyear Netflix deal with the stated goal of promoting ""greater empathy and understanding between peoples.""

""American Factory,"" the first film produced by Barack and Michelle's Higher Ground Productions, won an Oscar for best documentary."

The Rapture was supposed to come in 2011, with US preacher Harold Camping first saying it would come in May then readjusting his sights to October. Last year, of course, brought us predictions of the Mayan Apocalypse, which passed with lots of parties but no lasting fireworks.

With solar activity expected to reach a cyclical peak in 2013, this year was shaping up as another big year for apocalyptic fears, however NASA have recently downgraded their predictions for solar storms. So does this mean that we can have a year off apocalyptic frenzies?

A look at Hollywood’s release list for this year tells us that 2013 will be anything but apocalypse free.

Diabolo Cody’s remake of the Sam Rami classic The Evil Dead continues the zombie explosion of recent years, while Brad Pitt also gets to run from a zombie apocalypse and go all out to protect his family in World War Z.

Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, Tom Cruise, Will and Jaden Smith and Guillermo del Toro all have post-apocalyptic blockbusters scheduled and this year we even get apocalyptic comedy. The Shaun of the Dead team are back with The World’s End where five mates unite for a pub crawl that could literally end all pub crawls.

The National Geographic Channel’s new season of Doomsday Preppers begins this week. Their episode guide promises stories of a tornado-fearing farmer building an underground Noah’s Ark for his animals and a family man preparing for a nuclear-powered terrorist attack. The series brings us weekly stories from the survivalist movement who are going all out to prepare for the worst.

When Doomsday Prepper’s first season launched last year, it fitted the 2012 zeitgeist but the new season has a more eerie resonance with the widely reported news that Sandy Hook school shooter Adam Lanza’s mother Nancy was a prepper.

As J. M Berger [pointed out](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/17/newtown_and_the_doomsday_preppers](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/17/newtown_and_the_doomsday_preppers) in Foreign Policy, it is far too easy to blame Nancy’s enthusiasm for guns or her survivalist beliefs for the horrific events in Newtown. However, survivalist doomsday beliefs have been associated with a number of other terrorist and shooting deaths.

Berger points out that there is very little research about the mental state of preppers. But he believes “anecdotal observations” point to a higher incidence of mental illness among hardcore preppers than in the general population. He adds:

World ending, conspiratorial beliefs are easy to dismiss as symptoms of possible mental illness but sociologists, psychologists, theologians and literary scholars who have studied apocalyptic narratives and beliefs are more inclined to speak of them as a form of sense making.

Apocalypse is the Greek name of the last book of the Christian Bible and colloquially it has come to mean a world-ending catastrophe because of the fiery visions of plaques, famines, earthquakes, wars and global slaughter described. But the word is Greek for “revelation” or “unveiling”. The proliferation of apocalyptic myths are in fact trying to reveal something. And their message is just as much about a possible golden future as it is about a gloomy end.

The apocalyptic myth is uniquely associated with the utopian: they are two sides of the one coin. The Bible’s Book of Revelation is filled with horrible world-ending visions, but it ends with the promise of 1000 years of peace.

Even Hollywood’s slate of apocalyptic disaster films aren’t as black and white as they seem. Western Australian academic Mick Broderick has suggested that rather than analyse these films, which undoubtedly celebrate a dazzling array of cataclysmic moments, under the rubric of the “aesthetics of disaster,” as Sontag famously did, they ought more rightly be seen as being primarily about survival.

The apocalyptic myth, which seems to exist in one form or another in all cultures, is doing what all classic myth does. It is trying to hold in tension two opposite possibilities and visualise what might emerge.

It is a fragile posture of hope, that stands firmly in the swirl of apocalyptic omens predicting bad endings and dreams of the future."

They have reached this point kicking and screaming, under great public pressure, after clinging for years to the fiction that they are just public utilities and that people can use their pipes for pretty much anything.

But now they have united, for a brief moment at least, against a major conspiracy theorist.

Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify have all taken action against Alex Jones.

They are deathly afraid of being accused of political bias, sometimes for good reason. Both Facebook and Twitter have both grappled with incidents of discrimination against conservatives, which may have made them gun-shy about banning (as opposed to shadow-banning) some folks.

But almost in unison, the tech giants teamed up against Jones, who runs Infowars.

Candidate Donald Trump appeared on Jones' online show in 2015, and yesterday Jones tweeted a video defense with the headline: ""EMERGENCY: President Trump Must Defend the First Amendment.""

Facebook said it has taken down some Jones pages ""for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.""

Apple said it removed the ""Alex Jones Show"" and other podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app. The company said it ""does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users.""

Google’s YouTube dropped the ax on Jones' channel, telling The Washington Post that it terminates users who violate ""our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures.""

And Spotify banned Jones altogether after earlier removing some podcasts, telling the Post: ""We take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community.""

I know Jones has a lot of fans—remember the controversy swirling around his interview with Megyn Kelly—but he's also a guy being sued by Sandy Hook parents for saying that the horrible massacre at that Connecticut school was a hoax.

Jones apologized last year, in careful language, for spreading the phony Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying he'd been given inaccurate information.

That’s not ""conservative."" That's at odds with reality.

Jones texted the Post that being banned by the tech companies was ""a counter-strike against the global awakening.""

""We've seen a giant yellow journalism campaign with thousands and thousands of articles for weeks, for months misrepresenting what I've said and done to set the precedent to de-platform me before Big Tech and the Democratic Party as well as some Republican establishment types move against the First Amendment in this country as we know it,"" he said.

Separately, Jones called The New York Times a ""globalist intelligence agency"" and said that the ""evil, wicked sociopaths"" who work for major media outlets were teaming up to take down Infowars.

I confess I'd like to know how the four tech companies happened to take action on the same day. Perhaps they concluded there was safety in numbers. They seemed to have an ally in Drudge, whose banner headline was ""APPLE REGULATES HATE.""

But this is just a skirmish. Just recently, Mark Zuckerberg got himself into trouble by saying he saw no reason to ban pages by Holocaust deniers.

There is a fine line between banning hate and bullying on one hand and censoring controversial political opinions on the other. These battles will play out in a hyperpartisan political atmosphere. But for now, Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify have all agreed there is one person who falls on the wrong side of that line."

The respected billionaire investor warned the global economy is to slip into meltdown amid China's struggle to maintain mammoth growth. 



The American financier told an economic forum that today's problems reminds him of the ""crisis we had in 2008"", which triggered years of depressions and job losses among the world's developed countries. 



He added: ""China has a major adjustment problem, I would say it amounts to a crisis.""



Mr Soros also said the developed world would struggle to return to rising interest rates. 



China's stock market automatically closed for the second time this week, after values tumbled by seven per cent.

The falls led to further panic in global markets. 



Britain's FTSE 100 plummeted by around 2.6 per cent at the open this morning, equating to a loss of around £40billion. Oil and commodity companies, which are particularly exposed to China's slowdown, fared worst.



 The crash has echoes of last year's stock market crash when the FTSE 100 recorded one of the largest one-day losses of the past decade in September, in a trading session dubbed 'Black Monday'. At the time, a former adviser to ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown also warned China would cause worldwide economic carnage on the scale seen in 2008. Damian McBride advised people to prepare for the turmoil by stocking up on bottled water and tinned goods. 



The ex-Head of Communications at the Treasury added that financial levers, such as cutting interest rates and Quantitative Easing (QE), which the Government was able to use in 2008, are no longer available.

And it's not the first time Mr Soros has warned about the threat of China's economy. Last year the investor warned Greece was not the biggest threat for econnomies, but instead China. He said: ""The major uncertainty is not the euro but China. The growth model responsible for its rise has run out of steam."" Mr Soros famously bet against the British pound in 1992 - netting a £690million profit - and became known as 'the man who broke the Bank of England'."

In foreshadowing an open-ended military and diplomatic offensive, secretary of state Colin Powell plainly expects unquestioning cooperation from all countries, great and small. This blunt message to all and sundry is: now we cut the crap. You are either for us or against us. We are going to win. Back us - or you, too, will lose.

These propositions demand urgent scrutiny - for despite Mr Bush's initial caution, here is the looming, daunting prospect of superpower unleashed, of Prometheus unbound. And America's friends must think hard and fast about what they are getting into. Did the world really change this week? For the American people, yes, without doubt. They discovered in the most awful fashion that they were vulnerable, en masse, to foreign enemies; and that their government could not protect them. For other nations that have long lived with terrorism, only the scale changed. But for Americans, the illusion of safety shattered. A culture of impunity in which US governments act abroad with little fear of direct consequences at home was smashed as utterly as Manhattan's doomed towers.

Is the US now justified in demanding unstinting support? Yes, but that support cannot be unthinking, too. It is incumbent upon Mr Bush to define the threat he would eradicate and the scope of the measures he might employ. The options in the shadowy world he is about to enter range from a full-scale, Gulf war-style mobilisation against Afghanistan to aerial attacks and special forces incursions. In prospect too, perhaps, is a return to Reagan era covert operations, snatch squads, secret funds, state subversion, and even political assassination. And as far as can be ascertained now, such activity may not be confined to crushing Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaida network. This uncontained American campaign potentially leads to the very gates of Damascus, to Tehran and even more likely, to Saddam Hussein's Baghdad.

The danger that others will exploit America's war for their own purposes is also apparent. Russia, for example, says it is happy to help crush terrorists, especially the Chechen variety. Israel is already acting as if it had received a green light for intensified repression in the Occupied Territories. Pakistan, pivotal in any Afghan operation, will doubtless want a quid pro quo, perhaps over its links to Kashmiri terrorism. And what will China's price be? Silence on Tibet? In Washington, meanwhile, another woeful prospect is the predicted collapse of congressional opposition to Mr Bush's rogue-bashing missile defence plans.

That Nato, the UN, G8, and the EU have rallied to America's banner is only right. The US deserves every sympathy and should be supported in taking all reasonable measures to find and punish this week's culprits. But international institutions, like governments, have a broader duty in the dangerous days ahead to deflect and mitigate the wilder lunges of this wounded superpower. Whether they can do so, given America's present mood, will give us a first measure of Mr Bush's crusading new world."

The idea is that if a market should be headed in one direction due to its fundamentals but has pressure in the opposite direction, it will eventually make a strong move in the course of the original fundamental direction. This coiled move will often be more substantial than what might have been the case if it had continued in the normal direction without interference.

Coiled markets happen when the market has been held artificially held down. Commonly, coil market snap-back occur in the commodities markets, such as gold and silver, but can befall any market.

Technical analysts refer to triangle patterns on charts as coils. In this chart pattern, as the upper and lower parts of the triangle move closer towards one another, more price pressure builds up. Like with tectonic plates in the earth, eventually the built up pressure will look for a release. As pent-up energy increases, theoretically, the more massive the breakout will be. At some point, prices will move outside of the triangle's boundaries. The question is, whether they will move higher or lower.

An excellent example of a coiled market is with a government that intervenes in its currency. Market observers often point to China when talking about the potential for a coiled Yuan market. The Chinese government has a penchant for placing controls on the Yuan, namely keeping it artificially low relative to its fair market value (FMV). If the government were to lift the controls suddenly, the currency would likely increase at a rapid rate.

However, the rebound on a coiled market is not always higher. The market for the pound sterling (GBP) became coiled in the other direction leading up to September 16, 1992, otherwise known as Black Wednesday. That day, a collapse in the pound sterling forced Britain to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).

The ERM was introduced in the late 1970s to stabilize European currencies in preparation for the Economic and Monetary Union and the introduction of the euro. Countries seeking to replace their money with the euro were required to keep the value of their currency within a specific range for some years."

In one of the longest, most passionate and sweeping speeches of his pontificate, the Argentine-born pope also asked forgiveness for the sins committed by the Roman Catholic Church in its treatment of native Americans during what he called the “so-called conquest of America.”

Quoting a fourth century bishop, he called the unfettered pursuit of money “the dung of the devil,” and said poor countries should not be reduced to being providers of raw material and cheap labor for developed countries.

Repeating some of the themes of his landmark encyclical “Laudato Si” on the environment last month, Francis said time was running out to save the planet from perhaps irreversible harm to the ecosystem.

Francis made the address to participants of the second world meeting of popular movements, an international body that brings together organizations of people on the margins of society, including the poor, the unemployed and peasants who have lost their land. The Vatican hosted the first meeting last year.

He said he supported their efforts to obtain “so elementary and undeniably necessary a right as that of the three “L’s”: land, lodging and labor.”

His speech was preceded by lengthy remarks from leftist Bolivian President Evo Morales, who wore a jacket adorned with the face of Argentine revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara. He was executed in Bolivia in 1967 by CIA-backed Bolivian troops.

“Let us not be afraid to say it: we want change, real change, structural change,” the pope said, decrying a system that “has imposed the mentality of profit at any price, with no concern for social exclusion or the destruction of nature.”

“This system is by now intolerable: farm workers find it intolerable, laborers find it intolerable, communities find it intolerable, peoples find it intolerable … The earth itself – our sister, Mother Earth, as Saint Francis would say – also finds it intolerable,” he said in an hour-long speech that was interrupted by applause and cheering dozens of times.

Since his election in 2013, the first pope from Latin America has often spoken out in defense of the poor and against unbridled capitalism but the speech in this Bolivian city was the most comprehensive to date on the issues he has championed.

Francis’ previous attacks on capitalism have prompted stiff criticism from politicians and commentators in the United States, where he is due to visit in September.

The pontiff appeared to take a swipe at international monetary organizations such as the IMF and the development aid policies by some developed countries.

“No actual or established power has the right to deprive peoples of the full exercise of their sovereignty. Whenever they do so, we see the rise of new forms of colonialism which seriously prejudice the possibility of peace and justice,” he said.

“The new colonialism takes on different faces. At times it appears as the anonymous influence of mammon: corporations, loan agencies, certain ‘free trade’ treaties, and the imposition of measures of ‘austerity’ which always tighten the belt of workers

and the poor,” he said.

Last week, Francis called on European authorities to keep human dignity at the center of debate for a solution to the economic crisis in Greece..

He defended labor unions and praised poor people who had formed cooperatives to create jobs where previously “there were only crumbs of an idolatrous economy”.

In one of the sections on colonialism, he said: “I say this to you with regret: many grave sins were committed against the native peoples of America in the name of God.”

He added: “I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offences of the Church herself, but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America.

“There was sin and an abundant amount of it.”

The audience gave Francis a standing ovation when he put on a yellow miner’s hat that was given to him at the end of his speech.

The pope made his speech at the end of his first full day in Bolivia, where he arrived on Wednesday. On Thursday morning he said a Mass for hundreds of thousands of people and said that everyone had a moral duty to help the poor, and that those with means could not wish they would just “go away.”

Francis praised Bolivia’s social reforms to spread wealth under Morales. On Friday, he will walk into Bolivia’s notoriously violent Palmasola prison.

The pope looked bemused on Wednesday night when Morales handed him one of the more unusual gifts he has received: a sculpted wooden hammer and sickle - the symbol of communism - with a figure of a crucified Christ resting on the hammer.

Francis leaves on Friday for Paraguay, the last stop on his “homecoming” trip."

Immediately the news was seized upon by proponents of toppling Saddam Hussein. But, by the spring of 2002, the Iraq-Al Qaeda connection was being dismissed in news articles in The Washington Post, Newsweek, Time and The New York Times. The reports quoted administration officials and CIA and FBI analysts--almost all unnamed--who said that on closer scrutiny, ""there was no evidence Atta left or returned to the U.S. at the time he was supposed to be in Prague."" FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III went on the record at a San Francisco meeting in April 2001 saying the evidence wasn't there: ""We ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads and checked every record we could get our hands on, from flight reservations to car rentals to bank accounts..."" But a Prague connection linking Al Qaeda and Iraq remains very much alive for New York Times columnist William Safire, among others. Within the week that media reports were discrediting the story, Safire--a hardliner on U.S-Iraq policy--fired off a column (5/9/02) laying out how the reports were part of a campaign by Bush administration officials to shoot down a troublesome story that would force the U.S. to act against Hussein. Safire chastised U.S officials who refused to be named in the news accounts, and quoted a reported statement by the Czech interior minister who says his intelligence chief stands by their evidence of a meeting between Atta and an Iraqi agent. Safire concluded his column by noting he can play the unnamed source game too, citing a conversation with a ""senior Bush administration official"" who told him: ""...we're still in the process of pursuing [the allegation of the Prague meeting] and sorting out the timing and venue. There's no doubt Atta was in Prague in 2000, and a subsequent meeting is at least plausible."""

Robert Oppenheimer served as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during the development of the atomic bomb. After the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, Oppenheimer was selected to administer a laboratory to carry out the Manhattan Project, the program that developed the first nuclear weapon during World War II. After resigning from his post in 1945, he became the chairman of the General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission. Prior to his assassination in 1963, President John F. Kennedy announced Oppenheimer would receive the Enrico Fermi Award for his achievements in physics. He was presented with the award by President Lyndon B. Johnson in December of that year. The “Father of the Atomic Bomb” died from cancer at the age of 62 in Princeton, New Jersey in 1967.

Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, to German Jewish immigrants. After graduating from Harvard University, Oppenheimer sailed to England and enrolled at the University of Cambridge, where he began his atomic research at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1925. A year later, he teamed with Max Born at Göttingen University, where he met a host of prominent physicists, including Niels Bohr. He received his doctorate at Göttingen while also developing what became known as the ""Born-Oppenheimer method,"" an important contribution to quantum molecular theory.

Oppenheimer became politically active in the 1930s and agreed with Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard that the Nazis could develop a nuclear weapon. Following the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, Oppenheimer was selected to administer a laboratory to carry out the Manhattan Project, a U.S. Army experiment aimed at harnessing atomic energy for military purposes. He led the scientific end of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, beginning in 1942.

The project was populated by many scientists who had escaped fascist regimes in Europe, and their mission was to explore a newly documented fission process involving uranium-235, with which they hoped to make a nuclear bomb before Adolf Hitler could develop it. The project was initially allotted $6,000 by the U.S. government, but by the time the work culminated in 1945, the budget had grown to $2 billion. That year marked the first test of the bomb, and with its success, two more bombs were deployed in the following month: one in Nagasaki, Japan and the other in Hiroshima. These actions essentially ended WW II.

After seeing the bomb's devastation, however, Oppenheimer argued against its further development, and he resigned from his post that same year."

• John Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff and a retired Marine general, wouldn't disclose who had his vote, but he did say that he wished ""we had some additional choices,"" according to The Times.

President Donald Trump may be losing the support of members of his own party already, with some GOP officials considering a vote for Joe Biden.

Sooner than expected, growing numbers of big Republican names are debating how transparent to be about their decision not to back his re-election, or may even vote for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.

According to The New York Times, Former President George W. Bush and Senator Mitt Romney won't support Trump's re-election, Jeb Bush isn't sure how he'll vote, and Cindy McCain, the widow of Sen. John McCain, is almost certain to support Biden but is ""unsure how public to be about it because one of her sons is eying a run for office.""

Former Republican leaders like the former Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner are still tight-lipped about who they'll vote for, and some Republicans are reportedly weighing their options between backing a third-party contender or openly endorsing Biden, risking the ire of Trump. Some say they'd possibly prefer a Biden victory if the GOP managed to preserve its Senate majority.

Dissenters are reportedly feeling a renewed urgency due to Trump's incendiary response to the protests against police brutality and a mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to anonymous sources. Retired military leaders, typically private about their personal political views, have grown increasingly vocal about unease with the president's leadership, but are still undecided about embracing an opponent.

Those considering Biden include unlikely surprises — including Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida, who has donated millions of dollars to Republican candidates over the years and served as President Bush's ambassador to the Vatican. Rooney reportedly hasn't voted for a Democrat in decades. But, according to The Times, Rooney is considering supporting Biden, ""in part because Trump is 'driving us all crazy' and his handling of the virus led to a death toll that 'didn't have to happen.'""

Eighty-nine former defense officials said they were ""alarmed"" by Trump's threat to use the military to end unrest, and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis issued an intense rebuke of Trump, saying he's turning Americans against each other during nationwide protests. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has also said that she is ""struggling"" with whether to vote for Trump. ""This fall, it's time for new leadership in this country — Republican, Democrat or independent,"" William McRaven, the retired Navy admiral who directed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, was quoted saying. ""President Trump has shown he doesn't have the qualities necessary to be a good commander in chief.""

While many of the big names mentioned by The Times did not vote for Trump in 2016, the lack of support is more meaningful when it concerns an incumbent president and his shared agenda with Senate leaders than when no ongoing conservative agenda would be affected.

But, The Times notes that polls today indicate Republicans generally are behind the president, and far more GOP elected officials are publicly backing Trump than did four years ago, including steadfast supporters such as Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Lindsey Graham.

John Kelly, Trump's former chief of staff and a retired Marine general, wouldn't disclose who had his vote, but he did say that he wished ""we had some additional choices.""

And while some Republicans are unlikely to go public, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware (one of Biden's closest allies in Congress) has become an emissary of sorts to Republican lawmakers. According to Coons, a number of GOP senators, regardless of what they say in public, won't vote for Trump in privacy.

""What he's always been is not scary,"" Rooney was quoted as saying. ""A lot of people that voted for President Trump did so because they did not like Hillary Clinton. I don't see that happening with Joe Biden — how can you not like Joe Biden?"""

His lawyer said it was written on Nov. 5, the day the deposed Iraqi dictator was convicted of ordering the killings of scores of citizens in 1982.

To the great nation, to the people of our country, and humanity:

Many of you have known the writer of this letter to be faithful, honest, caring for others, wise, of sound judgment, just, decisive, careful with the wealth of the people and the state … and that his heart is big enough to embrace all without discrimination.

You have known your brother and leader very well, and he never bowed to the despots and, in accordance with the wishes of those who loved him, remained a sword and a banner. This is how you want your brother, son or leader to be … and those who will lead you … should have the same qualifications.

Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if He wants, He will send it to heaven with the martyrs, or, He will postpone that … so let us be patient and depend on Him against the unjust nations.

Remember that God has enabled you to become an example of love, forgiveness and brotherly coexistence…

I call on you not to hate because hate does not leave a space for a person to be fair and it makes you blind and closes all doors of thinking and keeps away one from balanced thinking and making the right choice…

I also call on you not to hate the peoples of the other countries that attacked us and differentiate between the decision-makers and people … Anyone who repents — whether in Iraq or abroad — you must forgive him …

You should know that among the aggressors, there are people who support your struggle against the invaders, and some of them volunteered for the legal defence of prisoners, including Saddam Hussein …

Some of these people wept profusely when they said goodbye to me …

Dear faithful people, I say goodbye to you, but I will be with the merciful God who helps those who take refuge in him and who will never disappoint any faithful, honest believer. … God is great … God is great … Long live our nation … Long live our great struggling people … Long live Iraq, long live Iraq … Long live Palestine … Long live jihad and the mujahideen.

The details, which revealed positions going back to 2012, were quickly removed, the report said, but not before the newspaper and others saw a list of some of the short bets, which are wagers that the value of an asset will decline.

Among the previously unreported positions was a bet by Soros’s family office against Dutch bank ING ING, INGA, , a trade the FT said chimed with the billionaire’s publicly disclosed wager against German lending giant Deutsche Bank DBK, DB, . The ING short position was opened in June and increased to as much as 0.3% of the lender’s shares before being scaled back a month later, the data showed.

Shares of ING fell sharply in late June but have subsequently rallied. A spokesman for AFM, the country’s markets regulator, told the FT that it had made a mistake and moved quickly to correct it.

European market rules require hedge funds to report short positions to regulators, but only if they are more than 0.5% of the target company’s shares outstanding. Short bets can be part of a hedging strategy, offsetting other long positions. U.S. market regulators don’t require investors to reveal short positions, though long positions by certain large investors must be disclosed in filings after the end of each quarter.

Other trades revealed by the Dutch regulator included bets by the computer-driven Medallion fund ran by Renaissance Technologies, the U.S. hedge fund founded by mathematician James Simons. The list showed that the fund took out bets against small Amsterdam-listed companies since 2012, the report said.

Soros, the world’s richest hedge-fund manager, according to Forbes, rose to fame in 1992 as “the man who broke the Bank of England,” with a famous bet against the British pound, which was credited with leading to the currency’s devaluation and ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism.

Soros, 86, a major Democratic donor, saw his personal positions lose nearly $1 billion back in November as stocks rallied sharply in the wake of Republican Donald Trump’s election victory, thought the broader portfolio held by Soros Fund Management performed better, The Wall Street Journal reported. The firm manages around $30 billion for Soros and his family.

Soros has called Trump a “would-be dictator” and has predicted that uncertainty and disarray surrounding the new administration will eventually undercut global markets."

You see, when an aurora lights up the Northern Hemisphere skies over the Arctic, the same pattern should erupt in the Southern Hemisphere skies over the Antarctic. But scientists noticed the two didn't match up after they compared simultaneous images of north and south auroras in 2009.

Why would we expect them to be symmetrical in the first place?

The aurora is a visible reminder of the epic interplay between the sun's magnetic field and Earth's global magnetic field, aka the magnetosphere. The sun constantly pumps out massive quantities of energized particles, such as protons, helium nuclei and trace heavy ions. Together, these particles are released into interplanetary space, washing over the planets as the solar wind.

Other solar phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections (or CMEs), erupt, blasting magnetized clouds of these particles into space at high speed. The solar wind, solar flares and CMEs, and the effects they have on our planet, are collectively known as ""space weather."" All this space weather can have powerful effects on our planet — and our technology — once it encounters our planet's magnetosphere.

One such effect is a geomagnetic storm. It can happen if the sun's magnetic field interacts with the magnetosphere in a certain way, injecting the magnetosphere with solar particles that create auroras. Auroras develop when these particles follow our planet's magnetic field to the poles, raining through the atmosphere. Depending on which atmospheric gases they hit, a beautifully colorful light display will occur.

Now, let's step back and imagine those textbook diagrams of bar magnets, with a north (N) and south (S) pole printed at each end. The magnetic field lines they create will trace out symmetrical loops connecting the north and south poles. This is an oversimplification of our planet's magnetic field, but the physics is the same.

Next let's place our planet's simplified magnetic field into a steady stream of particles from the sun. This stream, aka the solar wind, is carrying the solar magnetic field — known as the interplanetary magnetic field (or IMF) — creating pressure on our planet's magnetosphere, sweeping it back. The day-side of our magnetosphere will be compressed, whereas the night-side of the magnetosphere becomes elongated, like a stretched water droplet. If the solar wind was steady, not a lot would happen; the stream of particles would flow uneventfully over Earth's magnetosphere. However, we know that space weather is anything but steady.

As the sun rotates, it washes solar winds of different speeds over our local space neighborhood, and eruptions like flares and CMEs can create very dramatic and dynamic changes in interplanetary space. If the magnetic conditions are right, the sun can fling a bubble of magnetized particles at Earth that will be injected into the layers of the magnetosphere (imagining the layers of the magnetosphere like layers of onion skin isn't far from its actual structure). These particles are then swept back into the tail of the magnetosphere (aptly named the ""magnetotail"") where they are stored until the magnetotail undergoes reconnection events, releasing pressure and forcing the stored solar particles to flow along the magnetic field lines to Earth's atmosphere. Magnetic reconnection is a phenomenon where magnetic fields are forced together, snap like elastic and then reconnect, releasing energy, along with a massive surge of particles.

All things being equal, and remembering our simple bar magnet diagram described earlier, the field lines leading to the North and South poles of Earth should look the same, and equal amounts of particles should rain down in identical patterns over the Arctic and Antarctic. And this is where two new and complementary studies, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics and the journal Annales Geophysicae, come in.

In 2009, space weather experts compared the patterns of auroras erupting during a geomagnetic storm. What they saw was confusing; the patterns created were in different locations and had different shapes than predicted. At the time, they assumed this asymmetry was caused by the complexity of reconnection events in the magnetotail, sending differing quantities of charged particles to the North and South poles, thus creating the mismatch. However, these new studies indicate that the asymmetry may actually be caused by the orientation of IMF embedded in the streams of solar wind first encounters our planet's magnetosphere — something that the researchers call ""asymmetric geospace.""

Confused? The American Geophysical Union produced an excellent video explaining this:

We can imagine the sun's magnetic field as a series of lines randomly oriented, washing over Earth like shallow waves would wash over a pebble on a beach. If they have a magnetic north-south orientation that matches the north-south orientation of the magnetosphere, they will connect to Earth's magnetic field and sweep back, merging with the magnetotail, along with the solar wind particles they contain. In this case, the magnetotail will appear symmetric, and any auroras generated will also be symmetric. Patterns matched!

But what if the sun's magnetic field is oriented east-west relative to Earth's north-south field? According to these new studies, this can cause the magnetotail to become twisted and asymmetric. As you can probably guess, this will have an effect on the auroras that are produced, funnelling the solar particles in an asymmetric pattern and creating asymmetric auroras. Patterns not matched!

Over time, as increasingly more energy is released via reconnection in the magnetotail, it will untwist and these auroras slowly return to their symmetrical shape. This is counterintuitive. Space weather experts once assumed that the asymmetry used to be caused by magnetic reconnection. In reality, it seems that reconnection releases magnetic pressure to return the auroras to symmetry."

How about at a military outpost in Afghanistan, or at a clinic in Zambia? Thousands of people do every year, and in the world's most resource-poor areas, medical personnel need a way to sterilize their equipment quickly and completely.

The World Health Organization reports that 10 percent of patients hospitalized in developing countries contract at least one healthcare-associated infection. In Intensive Care Units, the number is closer to 60 percent.

A new solar-powered device created by researchers at Rice University in Houston, Texas, uses the sun's energy to super-heat millions of tiny metallic nanoparticles. The particles, submerged in water, create scorching hot, disinfecting steam in about five minutes.

The system uses no electricity or fuel and little water, and it generates steam hot enough to kill even the most resilient microbes.

Rice researcher Naomi Halas presented her team's prototype today in a keynote address at the 246th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Indiana.

Traditional autoclaves, the machines surgeons in the U.S. use to disinfect their equipment, rely on electricity. But a World Bank report from May of this year says that 1.2 billion people in the world aren't connected to the power grid.

""We have developed a solution, our solar steam technology,"" Halas said. ""It is completely off-grid, uses sunlight as the energy source, is not that large, kills disease-causing microbes effectively and relatively quickly, and is easy to operate. This is an incredibly promising technology.""

Halas has made one solar-powered autoclave prototype, and another model designed to sterilize human waste for families without access to plumbing or running water.

She's hopeful that the technology could also be adapted for cooking, purifying drinking water, and generating power on its own by using steam to spin small turbines.

The autoclave looks like a small satellite dish, with a concave mirror that concentrates sunlight onto a container of water and metal or conductive-carbon nanoparticles. The particles are so tiny that it would take 1,000 of them to reach the width of a human hair, but they absorb light across the solar spectrum.

When the particles—dubbed “nanoheaters”—get hot, a layer of steam forms on their surfaces and they rise to the top of the water container, releasing steam into a collection tube. Then they sink back to the bottom to begin the process again.

""Nanoheaters generate steam at a remarkably high efficiency,"" Halas said. ""More than 80 percent of the energy they absorb from sunlight goes into production of steam. In the conventional production of steam, you would have to heat the entire container of water until it boils, with the bubbles rising to the top to release steam. With nanoheaters, less than 20 percent of the energy heats the neighboring liquid.""

The device is the first practical application of nanoparticle technology described last year in the journal ACS Nano. Funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation helped make the prototype possible.

The technology is not currently small enough, durable enough, or inexpensive enough for widespread deployment, but Halas has formed a company to develop the device for commercial use.

For example, let’s assume an investor purchases a $10,000 bond at par. The bond has a 10% coupon paid semiannually and matures in three years. If market yields stay at 10%, the following would occur at the end of the first two years:

As the table shows, the investor would receive $2,000 in coupon payments, which he would reinvest as he receives them at the market rate of 10% per year, earning him another $155. When the coupons and the interest on interest are added to the bond principal, the accumulated value of his investment is $12,155, for a 10% annual return.

Now consider what happens if market yields increase, say to 15%, right after the investor purchases the bond.

The higher reinvestment rate increased the amount of interest the investor earned on the coupon payments. However, the price of the bond fell more than enough to offset this gain. The net result was a decrease in total return. Now compare this to what would have happened if reinvestment rates fell to 8% instead.

In this example, the low reinvestment rate reduced the interest earned on the coupon payments. But the bond price rose, offsetting some of this loss. The net result was an increase in total return. Thus, the yin-yang relationship between interest rates and bond prices also creates a tradeoff between reinvestment risk and interest rate risk.

The trick to immunization therefore is to find bonds where the change in interest on interest exactly offsets the change in price when rates change. This can be done by setting the duration of the portfolio equal to the investor’s time horizon and making sure the initial present value of the bond equals the present value of the liability in question. In our previous example, we assumed the investor intended to hold the bond for two years, presumably because he intends to use the money to fund some obligation. Thus, to immunize the portfolio, the investor should set the duration to two years. Six months later, the investment horizon will be 1.5 years, and the investor should rebalance the portfolio’s duration to equal 1.5 years, and so on. The intended result: an income portfolio that has an assured return for a specific time horizon regardless of changes in interest rates."

The stock market is moving higher on optimism about reopening the economy in spite of a perfect storm of bleak developments, including the global coronavirus pandemic, record unemployment numbers and often violent upheaval over racial inequality. Amid escalating protests, the S&P 500 is still up over 1% so far this week—and up almost 3% since the unrest began on May 26. The market’s subdued reaction to widespread protests over the death of George Floyd is “consistent with the very sharp disconnect between markets and the economy,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser for Allianz, told the Financial Times. A crucial factor lifting stocks in 2020 is the unprecedented intervention of the Federal Reserve to support the economy: The Central Bank has injected nearly $3 trillion into financial markets since the end of February. The Fed has enacted a slew of emergency initiatives including rate cuts, lending programs and credit facilities that are giving investors reassurance the Central Bank will step in to save the financial system if needed. For instance, the Fed began buying up short-term corporate debt and municipal bonds for the first time ever, promised to buy an unlimited amount of government debt for the duration of the coronavirus crisis and is also launching a Main Street lending program for small- and medium-size businesses. The Fed’s actions have “without question” helped prop up the economy, says Mark Freeman, chief investment officer at Socorro Asset Management. The combination of proactive monetary policy with historic government stimulus efforts has been an “exceptionally powerful force in driving the market.” Historically, the market tends to look past most civil unrest, with many analysts pointing to precedents like President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination, the 1965 civil rights march in Selma, the 1967 Vietnam War protests, the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the 1992 riots sparked by the police beating of Rodney King. In each of those years, the S&P 500 still posted annual gains ranging from 4% to 20%.

“As painful as this is right now, it hasn’t gotten to the point where it changes the market’s outlook for a recovery—it’s that simple,” says Freeman. The protests are “not viewed as significant from an earnings standpoint, and that’s ultimately what the market comes back to” time and time again. The only way to justify current price levels, he adds, is that “the market isn’t looking at 2020, but instead ahead to 2021 and beyond that.”

The market has pushed through turmoil in recent decades as well, Nicholas Colas, cofounder of DataTrek Research, noted in a report. Stocks still posted gains in 1999, after President Bill Clinton was impeached, and in 2011 during the Occupy Wall Street protests. “What matters to markets right now is how/when the U.S. economy restarts from Covid Crisis shutdowns,” Colas argues. “If protests or political spillover start to hurt consumer confidence, that would spell lower stock prices.”

What to watch for

If protests continue for longer than expected and cause more economic damage in cities, that could pose a threat to the market’s recent rally, investors say. Not only that, consumer confidence (a key driver of stock market performance) could be pressured by continued civil unrest, warned RBC Capital Markets. Some analysts are also worried about President Trump’s warning that he would send in the military to help quell protests, while others fear that large groups of protesters could lead to a second wave of coronavirus infections. “Not only does the violence and damage to property hinder the reopening of the economy, but it surely also creates a hotbed for renewed infection,” Robert Carnell, head of Asia-Pacific research at ING, told the Times.

Stocks are rallying—even after several days of escalating protests across the country—because the market is blind to social justice, CNBC anchor Jim Cramer said on Monday. “The market has no conscience,” he added. “Investors are simply trying to make money.” That’s just the nature of the stock market, Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, similarly told CNBC. “The market always seems heartless,” she said, adding, “the algorithms almost certainly have no shred of empathy.”

The chemtrail conspiracy theory, that aircraft contrails secretly contain chemicals which are being pumped into the atmosphere, is one of the most supported on Earth. At its most bizarre extreme, conspiracy theorists believe that the contrails which form behind jet aircraft due to a drop in temperature are actually streams of toxic “mind-control” chemicals, which dilute before they reach the ground, leaving a gas we breathe in that keeps the general population in check. But there are a growing number of chemtrail believers, who claim the conspiracy is actually a secret global plot to change Earth’s climate in the hope it will reverse the effects of climate change. Believers of the conspiracy theory include Hollywood hardman Chuck Norris and the late pop legend Prince. There have been claims the video is a CGI hoax, but others believe it is genuine.

Scott C Waring, who runs www.ufosightingsdaily.com, discussed the footage, said to have been filmed over the French capital last Wednesday, on his blog. He wrote: ""This cloud orb was seen over Paris last week moving slowly though a chemtrail, possible analysing its make up to come to some conclusions about how humanity pollutes its air."" The video was uploaded by YouTube channel WTFflow, which is run by a UFO and chemtrail investigator based in France. He said it was filmed at 7.41pm local time. He wrote in a promotional blurb for the video: ""I caught an extraordinary UFO sighting. I was watching an odd looking light crossing the sky at variable speeds around my house, during the sunset. ""To me it was just some sort of helicopter, or maybe a drone, but after five or 10 minutes, I began suspecting the object not to be man-made.

""It was performing weird maneuvers, accelerating and decelerating randomly."" The investigator said when the orb accelerated towards the chemtrail, he began filming. He added: ""The object stopped in front of the chemtrail, and slowly destroyed it. ""Indeed, the trail was being consumed progressively. ""I still can't believe what I caught. The chemtrail got literally perforated. ""I can't be 100 per cent sure it's due to the object itself, but I'm sure there's a link between it and the chemtrail. ""Such a huge trail can't just disappear like that, for no reason! And only a small portion of the trail gets erased, just around the object.

""What was that object? A man-made prototype to delete Chemtrails? Some extra-terrestrial technology made to protect us? I just don't have a clue of what this is."" YouTube viewer Daniel Halley posted: ""It could have either dissolved or collected the chemtrail material. ""Either way, I'd like to witness this phenomenon myself. Keep looking up guys."" Daniel Ing Schalk added: ""Thank you so much for documenting this. Two weeks ago we did watch the same above Austria."" But Igor Kostelac posted that he believed it was fake. He said: ""Watch carefully the footage, this is a CGI. ""The chemtrail is untouched, but the grey cloud is covering a part of the chemtrail. ""If you watch carefully you can see that after he unzooms the scene that the chemtrail is behind the grey cloud which is covering the part of the trail and remains behind that cloud."""

Former United States President Barack Obama attributed many of the world's problems to ""old people ... not getting out of the way"" at a recent leadership event in Singapore, the BBC Asia reported.

When asked if he would consider stepping back into public life or politics, Obama emphasized that he believes in passing the torch to a younger generation of leaders.

""If you look at the world and look at the problems it's usually old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way,"" Obama said at the Singapore event.

""It is important for political leaders to try and remind themselves that you are there to do a job, but you are not there for life, you are not there in order to prop up your own sense of self-importance or your own power,"" he added.

Since leaving the White House in 2017, the Obamas have taken a step back from directly participating in politics themselves and focused on fostering new leaders, as a recent in-depth report in Politico on Obama's post-presidency documented.

Currently, three of the leading frontrunners for the 2020 Democratic primary nomination are in their 70s. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is currently 70 years old, Obama's former Vice President Joe Biden is 77, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is 78.

Politico reported that Obama, who will likely not endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary, is looking at the current field with cautious optimism and some trepidation.

While Biden's campaign team is stacked with many former Obama officials, Obama himself is avoiding ""putting his thumb on the scale,"" even when it comes to former officials in his own administration.

Politico reported that Obama naturally has a more ""familial"" relationship with Biden, but the former president has told people around him that he would not automatically endorse Biden and that the former vice president would have to ""earn it.""

In 2019, a whistleblower revealed startling facts about President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, triggering impeachment proceedings.

Whistleblowing is based on celebrated American ideals, such as the freedom of expression, the right and duty of citizens to warn of public wrongdoing, and the importance of the individual conscience. Pioneering whistleblower laws were passed by the Continental Congress in 1778, and by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, at the height of the Civil War.

But as important and effective as whistleblowing has become today, its rise is actually bad news for American society in the long term– a symptom of the breakdown of internal checks and balances on our corporations and our government. This current spate of high-level disclosures by whistleblowers coincides with the spread of cultures of secrecy, of outsourcing public goods and services to private contractors, of increasing normalization of conflict of interest and other unethical practices as clever business models, and the weakening of the very concept of public service itself. Watchdogs are disappearing, as regulators are captured, defunded or drowned out by lobbying, as local newspapers cut their staffs, and with fewer attorneys at the Department of Justice willing or able to prosecute white collar criminals. Corporate and government insiders realize that if they don’t speak out, no one will ever learn of the wrongdoing they see.

We publicly celebrate whistleblowers in the news and in films as heroes, but in real life we allow most of them to be permanently blackballed in their chosen fields. This two-faced view toward people with the rare courage to speak truth to power suggests why whistleblowing is so alarmingly easy to politicize. And since the basic currency of whistleblowing is a respect for facts and the rule of law, the act of whistleblowing, like democracy itself, is at hazard in today’s postfact world.

It’s not only an essential in Japanese cuisine, but it may also soon help us devise more effective painkillers, and it’s the secret behind a new kind of fire alarm for the hearing impaired. And by the way, most of us in the United States have never tasted real wasabi. We’ve all been deceived. More on that later.

Wasabi—the innocent-looking green paste that accompanies sushi and sashimi, a too-big bite of which can make your sinuses explode—may soon provide us with the key to creating new and better painkillers. So predicts physiology professor David Julius and his colleagues from the University of California, San Francisco, whose recent research has revealed the structure of the wasabi receptor.

The wasabi receptor, a complex protein located on the surface of sensory nerve cells, plays a crucial role in pain perception. When an irritating substance—such as wasabi, onion, mustard oil, tear gas, cigarette smoke, or automobile exhaust—comes into contact with the receptor, it prods the cell into sending a distress signal to the brain, which responds by causing the body to variously sting, burn, itch, cough, choke, or drip tears.

Now, thanks to a technique called single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (nicknamed cryo-EM), we know exactly what that annoying receptor looks like in 3-D. Until recently, cryo-EM, which involves freezing a tiny protein sample and then bombarding it with electrons, produced fuzzy and unhelpful pictures of proteins (discouraged researchers sometimes referred to it as blob-ology).

Now, however, with new improvements, cryo-EM is capable of providing a stunning resolution of 4 angstrom—that is, it can distinguish between objects as little as one four-billionth of an inch apart, which is about the diameter of a water molecule.

This degree of precision allows scientists to see just where and how various kinds of irritants bind to the receptor molecule, information that may in turn help pharmaceutical companies design drugs to interfere with the process and block the pain response.

The wasabi receptor, officially known as TRPA1, is one of a family of receptors collectively known as transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. It’s a relative of TRPV1—commonly known as the capsaicin receptor. The capsaicin receptor responds to thermal heat, as when you burn your tongue on a mouthful of baked potato; capsaicin, the chemical in hot chili peppers that just makes you feel as if your mouth is on fire; and—oddly enough—to spider venom. (If you’ve ever bitten into a hot pepper, you know what a spider bite feels like. See Peppers: Can You Take the Heat?)

TRPA1 receptors, however, are even more versatile than capsaicin receptors. As well as pungent foods and environmental pollutants, TRPA1 is set off by pain-triggering chemicals produced by the body itself—for example, in response to inflammation or to diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis—and TRPA1 may be responsible for the relentless itch we develop in response to poison ivy or to conditions such as eczema, liver failure, and various nervous disorders.

The TRPA1 receptors that respond to wasabi are concentrated in the nasal passages, which is why a healthy dab on your California roll gives you the sensation of a searing goose up the nose. The chemical responsible for this effect is a sulfur compound called allyl isothiocyanate, which also puts the kick in horseradish.

A whiff of allyl isothiocyanate is powerful enough to rocket you out of a sound sleep. That’s why Seems, a company based in Tokyo, is now manufacturing and distributing wasabi-based fire alarms. The wasabi alarms are intended for use by the deaf, who can’t hear the wail of conventional smoke detectors. According to researchers at Japan’s Shiga University Medical School, who tested a wide range of potential wake-up odors (among them rotten eggs, banana, coconut milk, and peppermint), a jet of wasabi jolts hearing-impaired slumberers awake in less than two minutes.

The nose-searing punch of allyl isothiocyanate is so distinctive that it’s tempting to believe that we couldn’t possibly mistake it for anything else—but it turns out that we can. In fact, when it comes to wasabi, most Americans have never tasted the genuine article.

Real wasabi (Wasabia japonica, or Japanese horseradish) is native to Japan, where it has been cultivated for at least a thousand years. It’s notoriously tricky to grow, since it thrives only in clear running water, and the rhizomes—which are grated to make wasabi powder—can take two years or more to reach maturity. For these reasons, genuine wasabi is expensive and is rarely seen outside of Japan.

Luckily, wasabi has a lot of spicy relatives. It’s a member of the Brassicaceae family, along with broccoli, kale, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, mustard, and (European) horseradish. And it’s this last—European horseradish (Amoracia rusticana)—that we ordinarily get with our sushi platters, ground into a nose-tingling paste, with an added dash of mustard and a splash of green food coloring.

Wasabi and European horseradish are similar. A prime constituent of both is the sinus-zapping allyl isothiocyanate, but they’re not identical twins. For one thing, the ingredients of true wasabi are volatile. Wasabi powder, added to water, loses its zing in about 15 minutes (though it can be stabilized somewhat with vinegar or lemon juice). Horseradish, on the other hand, stays hot for hours.

And, say those in the know, wasabi and horseradish simply don’t taste the same. Horseradish, for example, contains a hefty dose of 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate—a compound totally missing from wasabi—and wasabi in turn features a number of sulfur-containing compounds not found in horseradish.

Want to see what you’re missing? Pacific Coast Wasabi, which now has growing operations in British Columbia, Michigan, Washington, and Oregon, is now doing its best to produce genuine wasabi for the North American market. The bad news: Half a pound costs $70."

Even before he arrived the trip provoked fury, with reports that US security officials wanted to create a three mile ‘exclusion zone’ around him, effectively shutting down central London and stopping legitimate protesters from getting anywhere near the President.

Angry at what he sees as using the “threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose”, Thom Yorke e-mailed NME last week, urging people to protest against the visit.

When asked why he’d chosen to speak out, Thom told NME: “To make Blair squirm over his decision to take us into a illegitimate war (In Iraq) and follow this religious lunatic (Bush) toward a dangerous future for the whole planet.

“Both of these men are liars. We have right to call them such, they are putting our children’s future in jeopardy. They are not controlling the terrorist threat, they are escalating it. Blair will not be allowed off the hook by his pathetic pleading for us to ‘move on’, neither shall Bush.”

Thom continued: “(The visit) will be heavily staged I think. I expect they will use the threat of terrorism to suppress whatever they choose, intimidate and arrest whoever they wish. The majority of British people were against this war, and Bush’s visit will just taint Blair even further.”

While in the UK Bush will be staying in Buckingham Palace. Yorke urged the Royal Family to “do something useful” and protest too. He continued: “This is a royal invitation isn’t it? How about one of the little heirs to throne doing something useful with their lives and speaking out? Refusing to shake hands for example?

Albarn added: “We are still at war. We are still good at watching war. What does watching war tell us about ourselves? How does war lead to peace? How does watching war lead to peace? Two million people asked a question on February 15 – Why War? We haven’t had an answer yet.”

928,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Vice President Mike Pence and his press secretary Katie Waldman as the actors responsible for the claims.,True,The article discusses the actions of Vice President Mike Pence and his press secretary Katie Waldman in making claims about Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani's involvement in 9/11.,False,The article does not discuss any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not discuss any secrecy.,"Vice President Mike Pence's office knocked the media after he faced criticism for claiming that Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani allowed 9/11 terrorists to pass through Afghanistan.

“Some reporters are making excuses for terrorists who are murderers in order to diminish the incredible achievements of President Trump,"" Katie Waldman, Pence's press secretary, told Fox News on Saturday.

Waldman's statement didn't mention any outlets by name, but her comment came as publications such as The New York Times cast doubt on Pence's claim. However, it's unclear where some details in Pence's claim originated. The episode represented another flashpoint in the media's coverage of Soleimani's death.

In a thread defending President Trump, Pence tweeted that Soleimani ""assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.""

NBA COACH FACES BACKLASH AFTER ACCUSING MIKE PENCE OF LYING ABOUT SOLEIMANI'S INVOLVEMENT IN 9/11

""No one knows where Mike Pence got his Soleimani 'facts' from,"" a Vanity Fair headline read. The Independent shared a video titled: ""Mike Pence shares 9/11 conspiracy theory about Qassem Soleimani in attempt to justify killing."" And an Times headline similarly read: ""Pence Links Suleimani to 9/11. The Public Record Doesn’t Back Him.""

On Twitter, many accused the vice president of lying. ""Pence is lying about Iran/Soleimani's supposed involvement in 9/11,"" Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr tweeted. Kerr linked to an article by The Week that claimed Pence ""crammed 3 inaccuracies about 9/11 into 1 tweet.""

""Vice President Mike Pence may want to check a middle-school history textbook for this one,"" the article stated.

It referred readers to a tweet from Charlotte Clymer, press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign. ""Wow, where to start with how wrong this is...,"" Clymer tweeted Friday. Clymer proceeded to claim that 9/11 involved 19, not 12, hijackers, that Soleimani was a Shiite and therefore wouldn't have assisted Sunni terrorists, and that Soleimani helped the U.S. with post-9/11 intelligence.

But according to Waldman, Pence was referring to 12 specific terrorists who transited through Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks.

""For those asking: 12 of the 19 transited through Afghanistan. 10 of those 12 were assisted by Soleimani,"" she tweeted.

NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED MADE EERIE HYPOTHETICAL ABOUT SOLEIMANI BEING KILLED IN BAGHDAD HOURS BEFORE IT HAPPENED

In a statement to Fox News, Clymer maintained that Pence lied about Soleimani's involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks, as well as the number of terrorists involved.

""As much as Mike Pence and his spokesperson wish they could create reality simply by stating something, that is not the case,"" Clymer said.

Waldman also pointed Fox News to a State Department fact sheet claiming that the Treasury Department found Iran ""had knowingly permitted [Al Qaeda] members, including several of the 9/11 hijackers, to transit its territory on their way to Afghanistan for training and operational planning."" That claim came as part of the Treasury's 2016 decision to sanction three Al Qaeda operatives residing in Iran.

When The Times addressed this claim, they noted that the ""finding did not directly link the hijackers to any forces overseen by General Suleimani [sic], or specify how many may have been granted passage.""

""The notion that General Suleimani abetted the attackers at all also appears dubious,"" The Times' Zach Montague said. Montague added that Soleimani wasn't mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report, which also reportedly claims that the Iranian government didn't know about the attacks. The report did, however, cite “strong evidence that Iran facilitated the travel of Al Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11, and that some of these were future 9/11 hijackers.”

It's unclear where Pence's team got the 10-12 figure for terrorists moving through Afghanistan. Waldman told Fox News she wasn't sure if there was a public source for those numbers.

According to Waldman, neither The Week, The New York Times (NYT) nor the Los Angeles Times (LAT) reached out to her office. (A Los Angeles headline claimed ""Pence falsely links Iranian general to 9/11 attacks."") While The Week's story didn't include Waldman's clarifications, both The New York Times and Los Angeles Times did.

Neither The Week, LAT nor NYT immediately responded to Fox News' request for comment.

Not every media outlet criticized Pence.

Writer David Harsanyi argued in National Review, a conservative publication, that Pence was likely referring to figures from the 9/11 commission report. He also criticized journalists for suggesting the ""myth"" that Shiite forces like Soleimani wouldn't support Sunni terrorists -- pointing specifically to Iran funding Hamas.

""Really, it’s remarkable that so many journalists are seemingly unaware that the 9/11 Commission Report found that 8 to 10 hijackers -- of 19, not 12 -- traveled through Iran to Afghanistan with the help of the Islamic Republic. Let’s not forget: Iran still owes the families of victims of 9/11 billions of dollars for its role in the attacks,"" he said.

Harsanyi also addressed the lack of evidence surrounding Iranian involvement in 9/11.

""In a report teeming with wrongdoing, this is the one assertion that Iran apologists love to highlight. But we know that before 9/11, Iran had ties to Al Qaeda terrorists, offered them safe passage and helped train them. Perhaps the Iranians never imagined the extremists they were aiding would be as successful as they were on 9/11, but that doesn’t mean they don’t bear any responsibility,"" he wrote."

That’s according to a new digital health check-up from Worldcom Public Relations.

The report ranked Bayer, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and AstraZeneca, in that order, as the top pharma social channel users around the world, while Shire—now part of Takeda—and Gilead Sciences languished at the bottom of the 25 companies evaluated.

The study looked at the pharma companies’ blogs, apps, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Twitter and YouTube. By platform, Bayer took the crown on both Facebook and Twitter, while Novartis led on LinkedIn and Pfizer ranked No. 1 on YouTube.

Overall, corporate-level efforts are “fine” across the board, Serge Beckers, chairman of Worldcom’s Healthcare practice group, said. LinkedIn is well-used by most pharma companies for corporate news and sharing, while Facebook is preferred for “nice-to-know and engagement content.” Still, everyone in the category could be doing better, he pointed out—particularly on YouTube.

“One thing that was surprising is that most don’t make sufficient use of YouTube,” he said. “Video material has become much more important than it was just two years ago. … My advice would be to take some of the focus off Facebook or LinkedIn and put it on YouTube. Because as a search engine, YouTube is becoming increasingly important—it’s right up there with Google. If you want to be found as a pharmaceutical, you should be on YouTube.”

Another fairly simple step pharma companies can take is using local languages. Translating existing corporate messages, campaigns and posts for each country or region can make a big difference, Beckers said. It shows that pharma brands care about local markets, and besides, “if you already have the channels, which most do, why not put some effort into it and be on those channels in the local countries? It can be as simple as repurposing the content that comes from the U.S.,” he said."

""God willing, a new order will come together and we'll do away with everything that distances us,"" Mr Ahmadinejad said, speaking through a translator. ""I do believe the system of empires has reached the end of the road. The world can no longer see an emperor commanding it.""

""Now even elementary school kids throughout the world have understood that the United States government is following an international policy of bullying,"" he said.

President Barack Obama warned Iran earlier Tuesday that time is running out to resolve the dispute over its nuclear program. In a speech to the General Assembly, Obama said the United States could not tolerate an Iran with atomic weapons.

Mr Ahmadinejad would not respond directly to the president's remarks, saying he did not want to influence the US presidential election in November.

But he argued that the international outcry over Iran's nuclear enrichment program was just an excuse by the West to dominate his country. He claimed that the United States has never accepted Iran's choice of government after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

""Everyone is aware the nuclear issue is the imposition of the will of the United States,"" he said. ""I see the nuclear issue as a non-issue. It has become a form of one-upmanship.""

Mr Ahmadinejad said he favored more dialogue, even though negotiations with world powers remain stalled after three rounds of high-level meetings since April.

He said some world leaders have suggested to him that Iran would be better off holding nuclear talks only with the United States.

""Of course I am not dismissing such talks,"" he said, asked if he were open to discussions with the winner of the American presidential election.

Israeli leaders, however, are still openly contemplating military action again Iranian nuclear facilities, dismissing diplomacy as a dead end. Israel and many in the West suspect that Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and cite its failure to cooperate fully with nuclear inspectors. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.

Mr Ahmadinejad also proposed forming a new group of 10 or 11 countries to work to end the 18-month Syrian civil war. Representatives of the nations in the Middle East and elsewhere would meet in New York ""very soon,"" he said.

Critics have accused Tehran of giving support to Syrian President Bashar Assad in carrying out massacres and other human rights violations in an attempt to crush the uprising against his rule. Activists say nearly 30,000 people have died.

He said the so-called contact group hopes to get the Syrian government and opposition to sit across from each other.

""I will do everything in my power to create stability, peace and understanding in Syria,"" Ahmadinejad said.

Earlier this month, Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi announced the formation of a four-member contact group with Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. But Saudi Arabia so far has not participated.

He denied Iranian involvement in plotting attacks on Israelis abroad, despite arrests and accusations by police in various countries. He also vehemently disputed the U.S. claim that Iranian agents played a role in a foiled plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States last year.

Mr Ahmadinejad will leave office next June after serving two four-year terms. He threw out numbers and statistics during the interview to show that Iran's economy and the lives of average Iranians have improved under his watch. Since his 2005 election, he claimed, Iran went from being the world's 22nd-largest economy to the 17th-largest; non-petroleum related exports increased sevenfold; and the basic production of goods has doubled. Median income increased by $4,000, he said.

""Today's conditions in Iran are completely different to where they were seven years ago in the economy, in technical achievement, in scientific know-how,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""All of these achievements, though, have been reached under conditions in which we were brought under heavy sanctions.""

Iran has called for the U.S. and its European allies to ease the sanctions that have hit its critical oil exports and left it blackballed from key international banking networks.

Mr Ahmadinejad said he had no knowledge of the whereabouts of Robert Levinson, a private investigator and former FBI agent who vanished in Iran five years ago. He said he directed Iranian intelligence services two years ago to work with their counterparts in the US to locate him.

""And if any help there is that I can bring to bear, I would be happy to do so,"" he said.

He also claimed never to have heard of Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine who is imprisoned on espionage charges in Iran. Hekmati was arrested while visiting his grandmothers in Iran in August 2011, and his family has been using Ahmadinejad's visit to New York to plead for his release."

Vaccine opponents have made several unsubstantiated and often discredited claims about the coronavirus - which many have dubbed a 'plan-demic' - including allegations that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, is blocking cures to enrich vaccine makers and that the pandemic has been ""exaggerated"" by the media.

They've also falsely claimed that Microsoft founder Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to inject microchips into people - or to cull 15 per cent of the world population.

In recent weeks, Facebook groups supporting anti-vaxxers have downplayed the risks of the COVID-19 and criticized efforts to control the spread of the virus.

One anti-vaccination group, the Arnica Parents' Support Network, have hone as far as to claim the flu jab was contaminated with coronavirus.

Some went on to claim COVID-19 is not a pandemic at all - despite at least 3,231,701 confirmed cases worldwide, and 229,447 recorded deaths.

Other dangerous theories that have emerged since the pandemic was declared include a rumour the 5G network was responsible for the coronavirus.

The rumours have led to phone masts used for critical communication being torched and damaged.

Others have suggested Bill Gates seized on the pandemic to implement the New World Order, citing a 2015 Ted Talk in which he predicted an unnamed virus could kill up to 33 million people.

While the Ted Talk is real, and saw the Microsoft billionaire warn that the world was not ready to combat a virus similar to the 1918 Spanish flu, he clearly urged governments to invest in research.

Others have speculated that the flu vaccine is contaminated with coronavirus, claiming the virus is being used as a ploy to move to “a police state,” and that a vaccine was patented before the outbreak, suggesting the crisis was planned.

Despite the over a million confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US, vaccine opponents continue to endorse unapproved treatments, second-guessing medical experts and pushing fears about mandatory vaccinations.

They've also latched onto protests against stay-at-home orders in the US.

Last week, an anti-vaccine activist was arrested in Idaho after repeatedly refusing police orders to leave a playground closed because of the pandemic.

The woman, who was there with other families, is affiliated with two groups that protested at the Idaho Statehouse against stay-at-home orders.

Health professionals have warned vaccine misinformation could have deadly lethal consequences amid the pandemic, if it leads people away from traditional medicinal.

Dr. Scott Ratzan, a physician and medical misinformation expert at the City University of New York and Columbia University has disputed the anti-vaxxer claims, defiant that only a coronavirus vaccine can truly protect us from future outbreaks.

Dr Ratzan said: “But what if the effort succeeds and large numbers of people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children?”

The World Health Organisation has also dismissed natural 'remedies' for the virus, including eating garlic and drinking hot water.

On Monday, during remarks recognizing World Immunization Week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticized vaccine skeptics for spreading misinformation at a time when many families are delaying or skipping routine childhood immunizations because they're afraid of COVID-19 exposure in doctors' offices.

He added: ""Myths and misinformation about vaccines are adding fuel to the fire.""

Campaigners have long protested against vaccinations, despite evidence that they have eradicated diseases like polio and diphtheria and had almost eradicated measles, citing a distrust of modern medicine and government.

Others say mandatory vaccine requirements violate their religious freedom.

Health experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence the coronavirus was intentionally created or spread. They also insist that vaccines are not only safe, but essential to global health.

936,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions senior officials at the C.I.A. and the White House as responsible for ignoring the findings from Mr. Nixon's interrogations.,True,The article discusses the actions of senior officials at the C.I.A. and the White House in ignoring the findings from Mr. Nixon's interrogations.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"The findings from Mr. Nixon’s interrogations of Hussein that cast doubt on the Bush administration’s original justifications for the war, Mr. Nixon says, were ignored by senior officials at the C.I.A. and the White House. “The policy makers at the White House and the leadership on the seventh floor at the C.I.A. didn’t want to hear that many of the reasons for going after Saddam were based on false premises,” he writes.

Mr. Nixon’s most scathing criticism is reserved for the C.I.A, which he describes as a haven for yes-men excessively eager to please the White House. When he joined the C.I.A., Mr. Nixon says, he was told that analysts should “dare to be wrong” — in other words, be willing to take chances when the evidence called for counterintuitive reasoning. But he says experience taught him that the C.I.A. didn’t really reward out-of-the-box thinking. “As I found out in the Clinton, Bush and Obama years, the agency’s real operating principle was ‘dare to be right.’”

Mr. Nixon, who left the C.I.A. in 2011 when, he says, the work no longer excited him, depicts a sclerotic agency not much different from the Agriculture Department or any other large bureaucracy, complaining that the agency “was governed by lines of authority that were often clogged by people who got ahead by playing it safe and who regarded fresh thinking as a danger to their careers.” Since he had to submit the book to the C.I.A.’s censors, he doesn’t identify the stultifying bureaucrats and timeservers, although he does reserve special wrath for one boss he names only as “Phil,” who, he says, “as a schmoozer, had few equals.”

Mr. Nixon thoughtfully argues that the C.I.A.’s overeagerness to please the White House has led to a serious degradation in the quality of its intelligence. Virtually the entire analytical arm of the C.I.A. is focused on quickly pumping out short memos on the issues of the day that are immediately read at the White House. But the agency has largely abandoned its tradition of freeing up analysts to engage in deeper, long-term research. As a result, Mr. Nixon writes, few analysts at the agency now know very much about anything. “Expertise is not valued, indeed not trusted.”

The C.I.A.’s brief memos have become like “crack cocaine for consumers of classified information,” Mr. Nixon says. It’s as if the C.I.A.’s analytical branch has been transformed from a college faculty into a cable news network.

The trend toward quick-hitting but shallow intelligence reports — which other former C.I.A. analysts have also criticized in recent years, particularly since 9/11 — makes the agency much more susceptible to manipulation and politicization, and to repeating the kinds of mistakes it made when it inaccurately concluded that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction."
937,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions multiple actors, including Former President Obama, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, George W. Bush, and Bernie Sanders.",True,"The article discusses the actions and approaches of President Obama, President Trump, and the Republican Party.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Former President Obama, in his first appearance on the 2020 virtual campaign trail with presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, promised that “help was on the way — if we do the work,” before tearing into President Donald Trump’s “shambolic” approach to government.

At an online “grassroots fundraiser” streamed online — which quickly became the campaign's highest-grossing event to date — the former president recalled how various challenges he walked into when he took office, including the Great Recession and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, were made slightly less difficult because he knew that his predecessor, George W. Bush, “still had a basic regard for the rule of law and the importance of our institutions.”

Trump, on the other hand,was practicing a “shambolic, disorganized, mean spirited approach to government” that put in existential danger American values, Obama said.

“What we have seen over the last couple of years is a White House enabled by Republicans in Congress and a media structure that supports them that has not just differed in terms of policy but has gone at the very foundations of who we are and who we should be,"" Obama said.

""That suggests facts don’t matter, science doesn’t matter, that suggests a deadly disease is fake news,"" he added, making a veiled reference to Trump’s comments in February that the coronavirus pandemic was a “hoax.”

“That actively promotes division. And that considers some American in this country more real than others,” Obama continued. “That, we haven’t seen out of the White House in a very long time.”

The former president said that “help is on the way — if we do the work,” adding, “There's nobody that I trust more to heal this country and get it back on track than my dear friend Joe Biden.”

But, Obama warned, Democratic voters must not take the race for granted just because Biden is currently leading Trump in the polls.

""We can't be complacent or smug or sense that somehow it's so obvious that this president hasn't done a good job because, look, he won once,"" Obama said.

""This is serious business,"" he added at another point. ""Whatever you've done so far is not enough.""

The event, however, ended with a tender moment between the two men, with Obama saying, ""Love you, Joe.""

The event marked Obama’s first appearance of the 2020 campaign with Biden on the virtual trail. Biden announced at the start of the fundraiser that it had raised $7.6 million from 175,000 small donors and another $3 million from big donors — his campaign’s highest-grossing event to date of the cycle thus far. The event lasted just under 90 minutes. Obama sported a black blazer and a black shirt.

The Trump campaign seized on the amount of cashed raised shared by Biden, releasing a statement during the event that noted that it had raised $10 million ""over the weekend of"" Trump's sparsely attended Saturday night rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma — a total ""far more than"" the Biden-Obama event.

Trump himself, also addressed Obama's joining Biden on the trail, telling reporters at a campaign event in Arizona that to point out the former president's campaigning efforts for Hillary Clinton in 2016 did not result in a win for the Democratic ticket.

""Don’t forget I am only here because of him and Biden,"" Trump said. ""I’m only here because of them, because if they did a good job we wouldn’t have been here, there would have been no reason.""'

Tuesday's fundraiser comes just days after news emerged that the Biden campaign out-fundraised the Trump campaign in May. Biden's overall fundraising total, however, still trails the Trump campaign's massive war chest. The Trump campaign said earlier this week it had $265 million in cash on hand.

Obama formally endorsed Biden in April after Biden’s only remaining rival in the race for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., bowed out of the race."

With the 1997 economic crisis, this view was stood on its head: it turned out that Asian values, a.k.a. crony capitalism, had made the region uniquely vulnerable to financial disaster. Now that some of the dust has settled, it seems clear that both views were utterly wrong. Instead of being some kind of alternative, Asia has been the proving ground for global capitalism, the place where both the potentials and the risks of the New World Order have been most fully revealed. True, the Asian Miracle of the 1980s was less miraculous than it may have seemed, but it did show that rapid economic development was possible, that you didn't have to be of European descent to join the modern world and that the global economy offered huge possibilities for export-led growth. To put it another way, the global economy was not, as so many dependency theorists had claimed, rigged against latecomers. On the contrary, it offered the opportunity for countries like South Korea to achieve two centuries' worth of economic progress in little more than a generation. And that discovery energized not only the Asians but capitalism in general. But while Asia's growth has restored capitalism's luster, its instability has revealed that capitalism has not lost its old self-destructive tendencies either. Leaving aside the dress rehearsal in Mexico two years earlier, in 1997-98 Asia experienced the first postmodern financial crisis: a high-tech, globalized version of the Great Depression. Many investors and officials are now declaring it a one-time event. I think they are whistling past the graveyard. The truth is that through a combination of globalization and technological innovation, markets have outflanked the defenses put in place 60 years ago. Bank regulators and central bankers still have no good answer to liquidity crises that crucially involve non-bank institutions, such as hedge funds, that transcend national borders. And there is a strong case to be made that this particular crisis ended too soon. Few of the factors that made the crisis possible--high leverage, herd behavior by investors, the whole problem of a global financial system without global regulators--have been addressed. So now what? Here's a parallel. Suppose that a thoughtful observer had looked at the United States in the early 20th century. An optimist would have been impressed by the dynamism of the economy, concluding that it represented a vindication of the capitalist system and that the world's economic center of gravity was headed for a major shift away from Europe to this new powerhouse. A pessimist would instead have focused on the observation that financial instability was even more conspicuous on this new frontier than in older industrial economies, and that it seemed to be getting worse over time; he might have worried that this instability could shake the world economy so severely as to threaten capitalism itself. Both the optimist and the pessimist would have been right: American dynamism saved capitalism, but first, in the 1930s, American instability very nearly destroyed it. It seems to me that the parallel works pretty well. However you look at it, Asia represents the future of capitalism--whether that future consists of unprecedented progress, financial instability on a scale not seen since the 1930s, or both. And nobody knows how it will turn out. Paul Krugman is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

The memo, which outgoing national security advisor Susan Rice sent to herself on her final day in office, memorializes a White House meeting several days earlier where Obama and top officials discussed potential risks posed by Flynn.

A portion of the document formerly classified as 'Top Secret' has now been revealed.

'From a national security perspective, Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kislyak,' Rice wrote about the January 5, 2017 meeting.

'Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information. President Obama asked if Comey was saying that the [National Security Council] should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn,' she continued.

Comey's response was that was 'potentially the case.' According to Fox News, Comey continued that there weren't indications Flynn passed on classified information to the Russina ambassador, but noted 'the level of communication is unusual.'

Also present at the meeting were then-Vice President Joe Biden and deputy attorney general Sally Yates.

The memo was partially declassified in 2018. In it, Rice states that Obama wanted the matter handled 'by the book.'

'President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the intelligence and law enforcement communities ‘by the book,’” wrote herself.

“The president stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book.”

Comey 'affirmed that he was proceeding ""by the book"" as it relates to law enforcement,' according to the memo.

'The President asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team. Comey said he would,' Rice concludes.

The network obtained the memo from Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's office.

U.S. intelligence intercepts had already picked up communications between Flynn and Kislyak. Numerous officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, sought to 'unmask' Flynn's name from intelligence reports, including to information declassified by the Trump administration last week.

Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell declassified the document, as well as the unmasking information.

'What a job. I think you’ll go down as the all time great acting ever at any position,' said Trump, after Grenell gave remarks calling for transparency.

One Trump ally concluded that the memo proves that Flynn was being targeted by Obama' inner sanctum.

But it has been previously reported that Obama warned Trump not to hire Flynn months before the meetin, and that Trump proceeded anyway. He would fire Flynn after just weeks on the job. He said he did so because Flynn was not truthful with Vice President Mike Pence about his own Russia contacts."

He was shocked by how few people were patronizing the Miami, Florida, resort. “I went there and it was so empty you could shoot a machine gun,” he told Rolling Stone last month. “In fact, the day I left someone did come in and sprayed the place with a machine gun and no one got hurt, because no one was there. I walked all over, and I saw one group.”

He said the same was true of Trump International, in Scotland; Trump International at Doonbeg, in Ireland; and Trump Ferry Point, in Queens, New York. “I think the presidency has really hurt his golf business,” said Reilly.

Reilly was right. On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that business at Trump Doral has been in “steep decline,” and that the resort’s operating revenue has plummeted by a shocking 69 percent in the past two years — or, since around when Trump took office. “There is some negative connotation that is associated with the brand,” Trump Organization tax consultant Jessica Vachiratevanurak told a Miami-Dade County official, according to video and documents obtained by the Post.

“This story is completely senseless,” Eric Trump, who runs the Trump Organization’s day-to-day business, said in a statement. “Our iconic properties are the best in the world and our portfolio is unrivaled by anyone.”

During his conversation with Rolling Stone, Reilly also happened to reference Eric Trump’s tendency to exaggerate the success of Trump properties: “Eric Trump lied at an opening and said, ‘Oh, we’re so busy here at Trump Ferry Point.’ And I said, ‘Oh really?’ So I went online Saturday night to get a Sunday tee time. I had my choice of the whole day. You know, $180 to play golf in the Bronx is not a big seller. His business is down, down, down.”

When the Post contacted the Trump Organization directly, the company blamed the decline at Doral on the Zika virus and hurricanes warding off tourists. But Vachiratevanurak, as well as statistics provided by the company to Miami-Dade County, make clear that Trump Doral is being outperformed by competing resorts.

It’s not just golf resorts. The Post notes that, according to internal documents, revenue fell at three Trump hotels in New York and Chicago after their namesake entered the presidential race. As with Trump Doral in Miami, the blame can’t be placed on the market, as competitive Chicago hotels did not experience the same decline as the one belonging to Trump. The Trump Organization, however, blamed “gun violence” as the reason the hotel, which is located downtown on the Chicago River, is suffering.

The Post‘s report comes a day after Bloomberg revealed that Trump’s 36-year-old flagship property, Trump Tower, is also in trouble. Those selling condos in the monolithic Midtown building are doing so at losses of up to 20 percent. Again, this isn’t a market issue, as Bloomberg points out that just 0.23 percent (57 out of 24,871) of homes sold in Manhattan in the past two years have been sold at a loss. “The luxury market is softening,” Matthew Hughes, a Manhattan-based broker at Brown Harris Stevens, told Bloomberg. “But it’s rare that someone owns an apartment here for 10 years and takes a loss.”

Trump Tower also features office space that has remained vacant despite being priced under market value, as well as an occupancy rate that has dipped from 99 percent to 83 percent over the past seven years, according to Bloomberg. Though the building still turns a profit, this is due in part to Trump’s campaign renting out space. Regardless, its income is 26 percent lower than what banks projected when they were sizing up Trump for a $100 million loan in 2012.

As the Post notes, there are some Trump Organization properties that are faring well. For the most part, they’re the ones that don’t bear the president’s name."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

An aide for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.

Imran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.

Awan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.

Officials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.

Awan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.

""Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,"" Damron said in a emailed statement.

Awan and his wife, who also worked as a House aide, applied for the loan in December last year and told the loan officer that their Virginia residence listed on the application to secure the loan was not used as a rental property, court documents said.

The credit union does not provide loans based on homes that are used for rental income because they are a ""riskier"" forms of collateral, according to court documents.

However, federal agents interviewed several unidentified people who had rental agreements with the couple at the residence, according to court documents.

The credit union also required that the home listed on the application to be the primary residence of Awan and his wife. However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.

Awan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.

His wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.

Officials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.

Awan was released after his arraignment and is under a ""high-intensity supervision program,"" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney’s office spokesman.

Awan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.

Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and ""began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.""

""For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,"" Gowen said in an emailed statement.

""Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter. To an extent, the situation speaks for itself."""

President Barack Obama was named Time‘s Person of the Year Wednesday morning, making him a rare repeat winner. He was similarly honored in 2008, after he won election as the nation’s first African-American President.

The magazine says Obama, 51, was chosen “[for] finding and forging a new majority, for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking, amid great adversity, to create a more perfect union.”

In addition, the newsmagazine (which, like PEOPLE is published by Time Inc.), states: “He will take the oath on Jan. 20 as the first Democrat in more than 75 years to get a majority of the popular vote twice. Only five other Presidents have done that in all of U.S. history.”

The runners-up are (in descending order): Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who was shot and nearly killed by Taliban insurgents for defending women’s rights; Apple CEO Tim Cook; Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi; and Fabiola Gianotti, one of the lead researchers working on the discovery of the Higgs Boson."
943,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions John McCain, President Trump, Republicans, Democrats, and several other senators as actors involved in the repeal of Obamacare.",True,The article discusses the actions of John McCain and other senators in opposing the repeal of Obamacare.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"CANCER-stricken John McCain has struck another blow against President Trump's bid to repeal Obamacare.

The Senator has said he cannot support the Republicans' efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.

The Arizona politician said he ""cannot in good conscience"" vote for the new plan, dealing it a potentially fatal blow.

The reform would have repealed a mandate that most individuals get health insurance and would have suspended a requirement that large companies provide coverage to their employees.

It would have also suspended a tax on medical devices and denied funding to Planned Parenthood for a year.

Democrats have applauded McCain's decision, and his calls to resume bipartisanship on major issues of national concern, and a return to the ""regular order"" of legislating by committee.

The Republicans need 50 votes in the 100-seat chamber they control 52-48 to succeed.

So there is little margin for error when the Democrats are united against the repeal.

In a statement on Friday, he said such a bill requires extensive hearings and debates.

He wrote: ""That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform, without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority.""

Adding that he could not support a rushed bill ""without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect [sic] insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it"".

Kentucky Republican Rand Paul is also against the bill and Maine senator Susan Collins indicated she too may join the opposition.

At least four other Republican senators are undecided: Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran.

It is the second time McCain has thwarted his party on the issue.

In July the maverick Republican returned to the Senate just days after having surgery for brain cancer to side with the Democrats to block the controversial ""skinny repeal"".

One of The Donald's key campaign catchphrases was to ""repeal and replace"" his predecessors flagship healthcare reforms.

On Twitter, McCain said the repeal bill ""fell short of our promise to repeal & replace Obamacare w/ meaningful reform I hope we can rely on humility, cooperation & dependence on each other to better serve the people who elected us."""
944,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Mr Gates as the actor who commented on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.,True,The article discusses the actions of cryptocurrencies causing direct deaths and being used for illegal activities.,True,The article mentions that cryptocurrencies have caused deaths as a result of the illicit drug industry.,False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey missing information or show intentions to mislead.,"Mr Gates has commented on Bitcoin several times throughout its existence and in the past he called it a “techno tour de force”. But during an “ask me anything” discussion on the social media platform Reddit, the tycoon blasted cryptocurrencies for causing “direct deaths” as a result of the illicit drug industry. He said: “The main feature of cryptocurrencies is their anonymity. “I don't think this is a good thing.

“The Government’s ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. “Right now cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. “I think the speculative wave around ICOs and cryptocurrencies is super risky for those who go long.” Fentanyl is an opioid which is used as a pain medication but has recently been linked to deaths after it has been found laced in street heroin.

It is much stronger than heroin and is considered to be much more lethal. One Redditor pointed out that physical US dollars are also used in the global drug trade. But Mr Gates said that anonymous e-cash has the potential to make criminal dealings more efficient.

He added: “Yes - anonymous cash is used for these kinds of things but you have to be physically present to transfer it which makes things like kidnapping payments more difficult.” Bitcoin has made it easier to profit from certain types of crime.

Despite this, for the past decade-and-a-half, industrialized countries around the world, from the United States to Germany and from Australia to Israel, have been confronted with specious panics about vaccine safety and efficacy, many of which center around claims that vaccines can cause autism. These fears can be traced to two events: a since-retracted paper published by a disgraced gastroenterologist claiming the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was linked to a gut disease which, in turn, was linked to autism; and the United States's decision to remove a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal from standard pediatric vaccines in the late 1990s. The effects of these scares are being felt worldwide. Each year for the past several years, the US has had more measles outbreaks than at any time since the mid-1990s, a fact which is especially frightening given that the WHO declared measles eliminated from North America in 2000. In France, a nationwide measles outbreak has caused thousands of hospitalizations and a number of deaths. I will address several issues central to this topic: Given the overwhelming amount of evidence showing vaccines are safe and the total lack of evidence showing they cause autism, why do these fears persist, and what can be done to combat them? Has the public health establishment's response to these fears been sufficient? To what extent do concerns about vaccines function as proxies for more opaque concerns regarding modern-day health care? And finally, what is the effect of a lack of evidence-based research on the best way to combat misinformation?"

Emerging markets (EM) are suffering two sudden stops – in economic activity and in capital flows – but only one of them is ‘unprecedented’, writes David Lubin, Head of Emerging Markets Economics at Citi.

“As far as capital flows are concerned, the news is bad but not catastrophic, and risk appetite towards EM seems higher today than it did at the same point of the Global Financial Crisis.

“The collapse in emerging market inflation will give central banks more scope for easing. We think emerging markets might see rate cuts in the coming months that, by normal standards, might seem shockingly low.

“A key question for emerging markets is whether investors, both domestic and foreign, have any confidence that these countries can grow out of their debt, and on this issue we are pessimistic. Low interest rates in developed markets might help push capital towards emerging markets, but that’s not a reason to be confident about the future of the asset class given the uncertainties that now afflict the global economy.”

HSBC’s head of equity strategy for Asia-Pacific, Herald van der Linde, has written in a blog that many countries are trying to look at suppliers outside of China in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, with some governments encouraging ‘re-shoring’ – bringing factories home.

“But highly complex production networks established over decades cannot be easily re-shored or relocated. Where products are highly specialised or where mainland China is dominant, as with 5G telephony or cosmetics, it is nearly impossible – or it will take considerable time – to move those supply chains.”

In addition, Van der Linde notes there are companies using the current situation to increase operations in China, with the Chinese government offering incentives to attract foreign investment.

Van der Linde also predicts that tensions between Beijing and Washington could accelerate plans for China to become self-sufficient in energy, power and technology."

Belmont County health officials said the infected teens were with a group of about 90 students from Ohio and neighboring West Virginia who visited the Grand Strand earlier this month.

The students said they started to develop symptoms about five days after they returned home on June 14, according to Robert Sproul, deputy health commissioner with the Belmont County Health Department.

Sproul said all 45 students on the Ohio side are being tested for COVID-19 and so far 14 results have come back positive while several are still pending.

The health department is also working with the students' families to determine whether they may have passed the virus to anyone else.

Ohio saw a record number of new coronavirus cases reported in a single day on Monday with 729, bringing the state total to 45,537.

Cases have increased 9.5 percent in the last week alone, while deaths increased 5.1 percent to 2,704 total.

Several states including Ohio and West Virginia have reported coronavirus outbreaks linked to visits to Myrtle Beach, a tourist hotspot where infections have surged in recent weeks.

Last week West Virginia Gov Jim Justice cautioned residents in his state against traveling to the area.

'I would think twice before I did that, West Virginia, right now because they got a real problem going on,' Justice said at a news conference on Friday.

Cases in Horry County, which includes Myrtle Beach, have skyrocketed in the month since hotels resumed reservations on May 15.

At that point, 283 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in Horry County. By June 22, that number had climbed to more than 2,000, and infections had doubled in nine days.

Those numbers include only people who live in the county, excluding anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 after returning home from vacation.

Business leaders estimate 20 million people visit the area each year, 60 times Horry County's population of about 330,000.

South Carolina health officials have repeatedly urged people to wear a mask in public and practice social distancing as cases continue to surge across the state, where more than 25,600 people have tested positive and 659 have died to date.

When Gov Henry McMaster effectively closed the state at the start of April, the rate of new cases flattened out.

It started climbing again after reopening began in early May, and the rate keeps rising.

South Carolina now has the fourth-highest new infection rate in the nation when adjusted for population, trailing just Arizona, Arkansas and Alabama.

The state sets records almost daily for the number of new cases, the percentage of positive tests and the number of people in the hospital with COVID-19.

Since reopening six weeks ago, the message from both local and state governments in South Carolina shifted from shutdowns to personal responsibility, like washing hands and wearing masks, although McMaster has said he will not require face coverings.

After giving televised COVID-19 briefings nearly every day when the virus first started to spread, McMaster and state health officials have not spoken in front of cameras for more than a week. When they do talk, they say shutting businesses again is out of the question.

'We understand that what we're continuing to ask of everyone is not easy and that many are tired of hearing the same warnings and of taking the same daily precautions, but this virus does not take a day off,' state epidemiologist Dr Linda Bell said in a statement.

Myrtle Beach needs visitors. Instead of a shutdown, the community now fears that bad publicity could keep people away. That would be terrible news after restaurants and many hotels were closed for two months.

From February to April, more than 1 in 4 workers lost their jobs, and nearly 45,000 jobs disappeared in the Myrtle Beach area, vaulting Horry County to the top of South Carolina jobless rate, according to unemployment figures.

Some of those businesses remain closed. Others that reopened are struggling with the extra cost of cleaning, food and other supplies, and the reduction in revenue because they cannot accommodate as many customers under social-distancing rules.

'Man, at this point I'm just praying we get back to normal. I want to keep people healthy, but businesses are hurting too,' Myrtle Beach City Councilman Michael Chestnut told the Associated Press outside his restaurant, Big Mike's Soul Food.

He paused and shook his head. 'I'm not sure what normal is ever going to look like,' Chestnut said."

It is very important that your child return to your doctor’s office at the right time if your child needs a second dose of the vaccine. Be sure to notify your doctor of any side effects that occur after your child receive this vaccine.

Do not become pregnant for 3 months after receiving this vaccine without first checking with your doctor. There is a chance that this vaccine may cause problems during pregnancy. If you think you have become pregnant, tell your doctor right away.

Children who have received this vaccine have developed a fever and in some cases a fever with seizures. Talk with your child's doctor if you have concerns about this.

Your child should avoid close contact with people at high risk for catching the varicella virus for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. People who are at risk for catching the virus are pregnant women, newborn babies, and anyone who has a weak immune system that keeps them from fighting infections.

Tell your doctor that you have received this vaccine:
• If you are to receive blood transfusions or other blood products within 3 months of receiving this vaccine.
• If you are to receive varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or other immune globulins within 3 to 5 months after receiving this vaccine.
• If you are to have a tuberculin skin test within 4 to 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine.
• If you are to receive any other live virus vaccines within 1 or 3 months of receiving this vaccine.

Do not take aspirin or medicines that contain aspirin (such as cold medicines) for 6 weeks after receiving this vaccine. Carefully check the label of any pain, headache, or cold medicine you give to your child to be sure it does not contain aspirin or salicylic acid.

This vaccine contains albumin, which comes from human blood. Some human blood products have transmitted certain viruses (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) to people who have received them. The risk of getting a virus from medicines made of human blood has been greatly reduced in recent years. This is the result of required testing of human donors for certain viruses, and testing during the manufacture of these medicines. Although the risk is low, talk with your child's doctor if you have concerns.

It's in your body, the food you eat and the beverages you drink. You use it to clean yourself, your clothes, your dishes, your car and everything else around you. You can travel on it or jump in it to cool off on hot summer days. Many of the products that you use every day contain it or were manufactured using it. All forms of life need it, and if they don't get enough of it, they die. Political disputes have centered around it. In some places, it's treasured and incredibly difficult to get. In others, it's incredibly easy to get and then squandered. What substance is more necessary to our existence than any other? Water.

At its most basic, water is a molecule with one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, bonded together by shared electrons. It is a V-shaped polar molecule, which means that it's charged positively near the hydrogen atoms and negatively near the oxygen atom. Water molecules are naturally attracted and stick to each other because of this polarity, forming a hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond is the reason behind many of water's special properties, such as the fact that it's denser in its liquid state than in its solid state (ice floats on water). We'll look closer at these special properties later.

Water is the only substance that occurs naturally as a solid (ice), a liquid and a gas (water vapor). It covers about 70 percent of the Earth for a total of approximately 332.5 million cubic miles (1,386 million cubic kilometers) [source: U.S. Geological Survey]. If you're familiar with the lines ""Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink"" from the poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" you'll understand that most of this water -- 97 percent of it -- is undrinkable because it's saltwater (see illustration on next page). Only 3 percent of the world's water supply is freshwater, and 77 percent of that is frozen. Of the 23 percent that is not frozen, only a half a percent is available to supply every plant, animal and person on Earth with all the water they need to survive [source: National Geographic].

So water is pretty simple, right? Actually, there ar­e a lot of things about it that scientists still don't fully understand. And the problem of making sure that enough clean, drinkable water is available to everyone and everything that needs it is anything but simple. In this article, we'll look at some of these problems. We'll also explore exactly what plants, animals and people do with water and learn more about what makes water so special.­"

It never loses value. Except in 1915-20, 1941, 1947, 1951-66, 1974-76 1981, 1983-85 1987-2000 and 2008. In inflation-adjusted dollars, gold cost $4,000 an ounce 30 years ago. Inflation is for dollars.

The world is a mess. We’ve never seen a time like this: the Middle East and North Africa are in upheaval. Japan has been battered by atomic energy. The U.S. economy is sluggish. The Book of Revelation was a picnic compared to modern times.

Your dollars are worthless. You can’t buy a flat-screen TV with them. You can’t send your kids to college with them. Money can’t buy you love or happiness, put food on your table, pay for a trip to see the grand kids, put gas in your tank or pay the bills.

The Federal Reserve is printing money like Amazon prints books. Money is everywhere and it’s worthless. Everyone is knee-deep in cash. Line your birdcages with it. Use it for toilet paper. The Fed will give you more. The dollar is so cheap it went on sale at Groupon and no one signed up. The deal is off. They can’t give money away.

Because the U.S. economy is finished. We don’t innovate. We don’t make anything. General Motors Co. GM, revival? Smoke and mirrors. Software? Who uses that? Biotechnology? No one’s interested in living longer in these times. Health-care stocks? Technology stocks? Bank stocks?

Our central bank has pumped $600 billion in dollars into the economy. That’s $2,000 for every person in the United States. Talk about worthless, you can’t even buy a couple of ounces of gold for that.

Homes are so 2006. U.S. housing prices continue to fall. They’ll never come back. People don’t like roofs and plumbing and a garage for their GM cars. Houses are for flipping. Gold is forever. Rent an apartment, put your gold on the floor and stare at it. It will keep you warm.

We’ve been out-Chinese-ed, out-German-ed and India-ed. Those economies are the envy of the world. Chinese banks haven’t made any bad loans and it’s a Shanghai-La as long as you can live on $6,000 a year and aren’t one of the billions of people who can’t speak or move about freely. And talk about opportunity: Who wouldn’t want their 10-year-olds working in a factory stripping copper from old computer monitors? Everyone works.

And how about the Germans. Germany’s export boom will go on infinitely even as the euro rises. The Germans are so rich, they’re bailing out the rest of Europe even though their own debt-to-GDP is 79%.

India is the best place in the world to do business, except for the overcrowding, corruption, dependence on agriculture, and the fact that 25% of its people are below the poverty line. India is running double-digit inflation and has a infant-mortality rate higher than Zimbabwe, Mongolia, North Korea and Namibia. Sad, but it means more farm jobs for the living.

It’s the only thing that will be valuable when the New World Order shows itself. Right now, the Illuminati, Trilateral Commission and the Freemasons are planning for the end and they won’t be satisfied until they have world. domination or a better public relations firm.

Because you’re a patriot. Gold hires people. It takes a chance on an idea. It believes that, for all of our politicians and corporate missteps, we have a dynamic country that can compete with anyone. Gold makes a statement. It says “I think the American people work as hard and are as resourceful as anyone on the planet,” and then adds “but for now, I’m just going to hide out in this bunker and eat Spam until someone else has the guts to create a new business with a great idea and gives me a job.”

Gold looks good and does nothing. And isn’t that how it should be? Look at all these people trying to “do” something: putting out fires, doing our taxes, teaching our kids, giving us check-ups, taking care of our elderly, serving us our meals, reporting the news, constructing casinos, delivering our packages, building our roads, making solar panels — what a bunch of morons. They should be buying gold!

Those idiots will know who’s boss when the economy comes crashing down and we’re left in a total state of anarchy. You can imagine the scene: busted businesses, poverty everywhere, road signs in Chinese. They’ll be the ones working for yuan and euros to pay for their government homes and the rest of us will be standing on top laughing at them. We were the ones who saw it coming, loaded up on guns and Oreos, and put our money to good use. Look who’s laughing at our ruined society now. Ha! We were smart enough to heed the words."

What’s more, the Pentagon can’t find documents to explain what it spent as much as $1.7 billion on from funds held on behalf of the Iraqi government by the New York Federal Reserve, the report says.

The missing records raise new questions about how the US government handled billions of dollars in Iraqi funds during the war.

The new report, the latest in a multi-year investigation by the inspector general into missing money in Iraq, paints a picture of Pentagon officials digging through boxes of hard copy records looking for missing paper copies of Excel spreadsheets, monthly reports and other paper documents that should have been kept detailing what the money was spent on and why those expenditures were necessary. Apparently, there are no electronic records to back up the spending.

The Inspector General’s report concludes that the problem is simply one of “records management.” But the report explains the missing records make it impossible to conduct a complete accounting of what happened to the funds.

The missing money came from the Development Fund for Iraq, a cache of billions of dollars in frozen Saddam Hussein regime assets that was held at the New York Federal Reserve on behalf of the Iraqi people.

After the Coalition Provisional Authority turned over sovereignty to the new government of Iraq in 2004 after the US invasion, the government of Iraq turned over about $3 billion of the money to the Pentagon to help pay for contracts the CPA had authorized before it ceased operations. Of that money, most was held in an account worth about $2.8 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the remainder, $217.7 million, was held in cash in Saddam’s palace.

While the New York Federal Reserve was able to provide the Inspector General with some information on electronic payments made from the funds it held, the Department of Defense was unable to provide documentation to explain why it had authorized that expenditure of $1.7 billion of the funds held at the New York Fed. And although the Pentagon spent $193.3 million of the cash at the presidential palace, officials there told the Inspector General that they could not find documents to support $119.4 million of that spending.

The Federal Reserve Board of New York told the inspector General that all it needed to make payments from the DFI account was authorization of certain officials at the Central Bank of Iraq. And the New York Fed also said it had written authorization for $2.7 billion that was spent from the DFI account. Much of that money may have been spent on US Army Corps of Engineers projects.

But the Department of Defense, (DoD) can’t say specifically because it can’t locate the records, the Inspector General said. According to the report, “DoD officials have Excel spreadsheets supporting about $1 billion of the $2.7 billion, or 37%, it used from the sub-account. These spreadsheets cover the first four months of payments from the sub-account following the CPA’s dissolution. DoD is looking for documentation supporting the remaining $1.7 billion in payments.”

The Defense Department told the Inspector General it had conducted an exhaustive search for the paperwork. “Comptroller officials told us they reviewed more than 100 boxes of hard copy files and conducted multiple electronic database searches of DFI documents in their attempt to locate the missing spreadsheets,” the report said. It added that Defense Department officials said there were no backup records.

In written comments responding to the new report, the Pentagon’s Deputy Chief Financial Officer Mark Easton wrote that the Defense Department acknowledges “the difficulty in locating DFI documents for the entire period (2004-2007) is due to a records management issue.”"

Just as FBI whistleblower Mark Felt called out Richard Nixon’s systemic criminality and Karen Silkwood disclosed the massive risks of nuclear power, so today whistle-blowers are explaining how Cambridge Analytica helped to corrupt our elections or how Big Pharma hooked our nation on opioids. In 2019, a whistleblower revealed startling facts about President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, triggering impeachment proceedings.

Whistleblowing is based on celebrated American ideals, such as the freedom of expression, the right and duty of citizens to warn of public wrongdoing, and the importance of the individual conscience. Pioneering whistleblower laws were passed by the Continental Congress in 1778, and by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, at the height of the Civil War.

Who should be TIME’s Person of the Year for 2019? Cast your vote in the reader poll.

But as important and effective as whistleblowing has become today, its rise is actually bad news for American society in the long term– a symptom of the breakdown of internal checks and balances on our corporations and our government. This current spate of high-level disclosures by whistleblowers coincides with the spread of cultures of secrecy, of outsourcing public goods and services to private contractors, of increasing normalization of conflict of interest and other unethical practices as clever business models, and the weakening of the very concept of public service itself. Watchdogs are disappearing, as regulators are captured, defunded or drowned out by lobbying, as local newspapers cut their staffs, and with fewer attorneys at the Department of Justice willing or able to prosecute white collar criminals. Corporate and government insiders realize that if they don’t speak out, no one will ever learn of the wrongdoing they see.

We publicly celebrate whistleblowers in the news and in films as heroes, but in real life we allow most of them to be permanently blackballed in their chosen fields. This two-faced view toward people with the rare courage to speak truth to power suggests why whistleblowing is so alarmingly easy to politicize. And since the basic currency of whistleblowing is a respect for facts and the rule of law, the act of whistleblowing, like democracy itself, is at hazard in today’s postfact world.

This appears in the December 02, 2019 issue of TIME."

The virus was ""highly active"" in Central and South America, the WHO's top emergency expert Mike Ryan said, highlighting problems in Brazil and Mexico. The current situation in Brazil, now one of the global hotspots for the virus, was of increasing concern, especially in heavily-populated cities, he told a news conference.
• Doctor's Note: Where are we in developing a coronavirus vaccine?
• Coronavirus: All you need to know about symptoms and risks
• Why 'physical distancing' is better than 'social distancing'

The country's health system was ""still coping"", although some intensive care units were at a critical stage and under heavy pressure with more than 90 percent bed occupancy rates, Ryan said.

Mexico meanwhile has nearly 130,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and more than 15,000 deaths, the WHO said.

Brazil is the second worst-hit country in the world, with more than 800,000 cases and 41,000 deaths, according to a tally by the Reuters news agency.

Both countries lag behind the United States, the worst-hit country, which has had more than two million cases and nearly 114,000 deaths.

""We are very much in the upswing of this pandemic, particularly in the global South,"" Ryan said. ""Some countries are having trouble exiting the so-called lockdowns as they are seeing an increase in cases.""

It was possible the disease was spreading again as societies reopened and people began meeting again, Ryan said, especially when there was inadequate testing and social distancing was insufficient. He acknowledged, however, the pressures on countries to get back to normal, especially to reduce the economic damage the crisis has wrought.

""There is a careful balance between keeping people at home ... and the untoward effect of that on economic and society. That is not an easy balance. There are no correct answers,"" Ryan said.

Ryan said although some countries appeared to be over the worst of the virus, clusters of the disease were still occurring.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gheybreyesus said that vigilance was required worldwide against the ""very dangerous virus"" even in regions where it appeared to be on the wane.

""Our fear is although it is declining in Europe, it is increasing in other parts of the world. Even Europe cannot be safe because the virus can be reintroduced to Europe,"" he said.

Tedros was also firm on the need for any vaccines had to be shared fairly between countries, amid concerns some could hoard any drugs they develop.

Vaccines should be made available as a global public good, to ensure everyone had fair access to any life-saving products that are developed, Tedros said."

Citing as an example of one of the most extreme, and potentially lethal, examples of fake news, the panel discussed an event on social media last December.

A fabricated quote attributed to the Israeli defence minister in a false report said that Israel has threatened Pakistan with nuclear weapons, prompting his Pakistani counterpart to warn that ""Israel forgets Pakistan is a nuclear state too"".

In the same month, a man who said he was investigating a conspiracy theory about US politician Hillary Clinton running a child sex ring out of a pizza place fired an assault rifle inside a Washington, DC, restaurant.

The Comet Ping Pong restaurant gained notoriety during the 2016 US presidential campaign after fake news stories stated that Clinton and her campaign chief ran a child sex ring out of the restaurant.

As the story spread online, fanned by right-leaning conspiracy theorists on discussion sites 4chan and Reddit, the restaurant owner received hundreds of threatening messages about the alleged scandal, dubbed ""pizzagate"".

Propaganda for political or economic gains is nothing new, but what constitutes fake news is contested.

For some, it is as simple as false information. For others, the term is dished out to media that broadcasts or publishes negative stories.

As Finnish editor Kari Huhta puts it, the argument often becomes ridiculous.

""[It becomes a contest of people saying] 'You're fake news!' 'No you're fake news!' 'No your mother is fake news!'"" he told the panel in Paris.

While old, established forms of propaganda are still largely the domain of wealthy institutions or governments working through traditional channels, fake news tends to be more associated with groups or individuals using social media platforms to spread sensational and outlandish stories.

""[It could be agreed that] a young man or woman sitting in their bedroom in Macedonia literally inventing stories such as 'The Pope backs Donald Trump' is part of the fake news phenomenon,"" said Ivor Gaber, professor of journalism at the University of Sussex.

Although the fake news phenomenon sprang to prominence after the election of US President Donald Trump, ""the Philippines was five or six months ahead of the US [with the May 2016 elections]"", said Maria Ressa, editor-in-chief of Rappler, a Filipino online media outlet.

""President Duterte came to power because of social media. He had the most sophisticated social media campaign ever."" she said.

The abundance of fake news ""has had a direct impact on the quality of democracy in the Philippines"".

A number of fake Facebook accounts were cooked up, attracting huge groups of followers, and were able to amplify a flood of false stories targeting Duterte's political opponents and critics, Ressa said.

However in the case of Trump, fake news was not behind his surprising election victory, said Serge Schmemann, a writer and editor with the New York Times.

Fake news ""is just a symptom of the crisis"" that traditional journalism is experiencing, such as the lowering of journalistic standards and quality due to financial pressures and time constraints, he said.

To stop the flow of misinformation, journalism ethics and guidelines should be brought to the fore, Schmemann added, recalling a particularly harsh punishment for making a mistake.

At his first job in a small New Jersey newspaper, young journalists who made a mistake that required a correction were made to eat a red hot pepper in the middle of the office to ""learn that a mistake is physically painful"".

Fact-checking tools and organisations are increasingly perceived as effective in disempowering fake news, among them Les decodeurs, a France-based team of journalists and social network specialists analysing and verifying news content.

But for fact-checkers to excel, it is necessary to provide readers with credible sources, said Evangeline de Bourgoing, director the Global Editors Network.

""It seems fairly obvious but if you want to refute an argument that is widely believed by a Republican supporter, you have to find a Republican to deny this statement. It's obvious but it's not something most news outlets do,"" she said.

""Misinformation is taking hold because it is communicated in a simple way, through powerful phrases, and your debunking must be equally simple to be efficient.""

In terms of public trust, journalists, along with politicians, are ranked at the very bottom of the ladder.

As Divina Frau-Meigs, professor of media sociology at La Sorbonne, said, large sections of society believe fake news in mainstream media is ""part of the establishment"".

Verashni Pillay, editor-in-chief of Huffington Post, South Africa, said that ""open disdain by some newsrooms towards their audiences"" might partially explain this public distrust.

Ginna Lindberg, a correspondent with Swedish Broadcast Radio, also argued that some of the challenges lay within newsrooms.

Reporters should return to the fundamentals of journalism, step outside the comfort of their newsrooms and privileged lives and speak to different audiences.

""We need to broaden our perspectives to make sure that we have diversity in our newsrooms, in our narratives. A multitude of voices [should be] heard in our media outlets,"" she said."

But she was nowhere near recovered, her cough and crippling fatigue nowhere near gone.

Five weeks later, on April 21, she returned to her job developing colors for a cosmetics company, but with shortness of breath and aching muscles, she found herself unable to take even short walks. Another test confirmed that she was no longer infected. But 11 weeks after testing positive, on the same day Italy first quarantined towns, she is still not back to normal.

“It takes a long time,” said Ms. Colombi, 59, who lives in Truccazzano, outside the northern city of Milan. “I can’t get back into my natural rhythms.”

Italy was the first European country to be hit hard by the pandemic — its intensive care units inundated and its elderly dying in droves before the tsunami reached Spain, France, the United States or Britain. And so Italy is also ahead in coming to grips with the long duration of the illness and the lasting consequences for some survivors."

“Tin foil hat brigade” is an expression used to dismiss virtually anyone who believes, without any evidence whatever, all the far out theories so beloved of modern social media users. Whether it’s oil fields in the North Sea that Whitehall wants to keep secret in order to convince Scots that we’re poorer than we actually are, or that the security services organised the 7/7 bombings on London’s transport infrastructure in 2005 to justify a draconian clampdown on civil liberties, “tin foil hats” is a useful shorthand expression that conveys exactly the right amount of derision and contempt for people who wish to broadcast their lower-than-average IQs, or at least their higher-then-average gullibility.

But now coronavirus has gifted us an actual, literal tin foil hat scenario. The myth being propagated is that somehow, presumably via a process of alchemy and magic, masts erected to transmit 5G phone signals are actually being used to spread a virus.

But, unlike his colleagues, who spread their alarm anonymously, Bolton issued his warning at a Federalist Society lunch, on Monday, that was broadcast live on C-SPAN.

960,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,False,There are no explicit or indirect mentions of actors responsible for a threat or malicious actions.,True,The article discusses the action of finding a way to destroy carbon-fluorine bonds in fluorocarbons.,False,There are no mentions of threats in the article.,False,There are no connections made between events or specific observations in the article.,False,There is no indication of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"The war on climate change just got a chemical weapon: a way to destroy the carbon-fluorine bonds that make a class of widely used industrial gases so dangerous in the atmosphere.

Gases made from carbon, fluorine and chlorine, called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), long used as refrigerants, were banned in the 1990s because they damage the ozone layer that protects the Earth from UV radiation.

But similar compounds that don’t contain chlorine, fluorocarbons, are still widely used today in products including waterproof clothing and Teflon cookware because their strong carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds make them highly water repellent. They are even a key component of artificial blood thanks to their high oxygen solubility.

However, fluorocarbons are also powerful greenhouse gases. “The real culprits of ozone depletion have been largely eliminated,” says Robin Perutz at the University of York, UK. “But the remaining fluorocarbons do have a lot of global warming potential.”

One fluorocarbon, tetrafluoromethane, is 6,500 times as potent a greenhouse gas as CO , although it exists in much smaller amounts, and is unreactive enough to persist in the atmosphere for 50,000 years.

Fluorocarbons’ inertness also makes them difficult to clean up. “It’s fundamentally difficult to do anything with these bonds,” says Oleg Ozerov at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. “So it’s an interesting challenge to find ways to break them.”

In 2005, Ozerov’s team found that it can be done using extremely powerful “Lewis acids“, which contain positively charged ions that can rip negatively charged fluoride ions from C-F bonds. But the reaction is difficult to sustain for long periods as the acid tends to become exhausted by reacting with other compounds.

Now, Ozerov and Brandeis colleague Christos Douvris have found a way to sustain the reaction for long periods. Under their reaction, one molecule of Lewis acid can neutralise up to 2700 C-F bonds. This means just 0.5 milligrams of the acid converts 180 mg of fluorocarbons into a safer form in 24 hours, and at room temperature.

The process uses a Lewis acid discovered by Christopher Reed’s team at the University of California in Riverside. This contains silylium – a reactive form of silicon with three, rather than the usual four bonds and a positive charge.

The silylium acts like an molecular bomb that blows a C-F bond apart. A second reagent, triethylsilane, is like a peacekeeper, coming in afterwards to tame and tidy up the highly reactive compounds produced.

The process starts when a silylium molecule rips a fluoride ion from its carbon partner. That produces a stable silicon atom bonded to fluorine, and a highly reactive naked carbon ion is left behind.

This is then neutralised when it grabs a hydrogen ion from the silicon in a triethylsilane molecule, producing a safer carbon-hydrogen bond and creating a fresh molecule of silylium to attack more C-F bonds.

The reaction is a “downhill” process, using very little energy, says Ozerov, and the end products have little impact on the atmosphere.

Perutz, who was not involved in the study, is impressed with the new approach. “I would say that this is a real step change in effectiveness over what was possible before,” he says. But he points out that the process is as yet untested at the kilogram scale needed for it to be industrially useful.

“This is important chemistry both for the beauty of its chemical logic and for its efficiency,” says David O’Hagan, a fluorocarbon expert at St Andrews University, UK. “The selective and efficient removal of fluorine in this way is an unexpected and interesting development, which is of immediate significance.”

Other proposed methods for neutralising fluorocarbons rely on collecting and storing the chemical rather than converting it into safer forms. “But the fluorocarbons effectively have to be stored in perpetuity,” says Ozerov. “If it’s at all economically feasible, it would be better to put the fluorocarbons through a chemical transition rather than store them.”"

Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen.

Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants.

The gates of the capital's parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors.

The Madrid and Barcelona regions, the most populated in the country, and a large part of Castile-Leon in the northwest are moving into the first phase of Spain's four-phase deconfinement programme, following what has been one of the strictest lockdowns in the world.

These regions have been on a slower deconfinement track as they bore the brunt of the pandemic in Spain, which has killed more than 28,700 people to date, one of the world's highest tolls.

Everyone must continue to wear a mask, which is already compulsory in buildings and on public streets when it is not possible to keep a distance of two metres (six feet).

The rest of the country meanwhile -- 22 million out of Spain's 47 million inhabitants -- is moving on to the second phase, which is expected to last until the end of June.

Restaurants may then reopen to a limited number of customers, and outings for walks or sports will no longer be limited to certain hours of the day.

As the summer heat arrives, beaches on the Atlantic Ocean coast and in much of Andalusia, as well as on the Balearic and Canary Islands, are open for swimming, subject to safety measures.

The health ministry recommends limiting the number of visitors to the beaches, creating boundaries and spacing umbrellas four metres apart.

Only locals will benefit for the time being. Travel between regions is still forbidden and foreigners arriving in Spain must quarantine for 14 days.

But the government plans to reopen the borders to foreign tourists in July.

The lockdown, in force since mid-March, has been among the most severe in the world.

In the first few weeks, Spaniards could hardly set foot outside and their children were kept indoors.

Many residents have become impatient over the government's slow and cautious process of lifting the restrictions.

Thousands of people protested on Saturday by car in major Spanish cities at the call of the far-right Vox party.

Drivers honked their horns, waved Spanish flags and banged on pots and pans to denounce the management of the coronavirus crisis by the left-wing government of Pedro Sanchez."

The study, conducted in Quebec, rekindles the still-controversial connection between Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and the 1976 swine flu outbreak, which halted that year's flu vaccination program in the United States. It also raises questions about vaccines for flu strains originating in swine.

This latest analysis, led by Philippe De Wals of Laval University, Quebec City, Canada, followed 4.4 million residents vaccinated against the H1N1 ""swine flu"" in late 2009. Over the next six months, 25 people who received the vaccine developed GBS. Across the Quebec province, however, another 58 people who were not vaccinated also developed GBS.

De Wals said that, regarding the entire population, the number of GBS cases attributed to the swine flu vaccine was about 2 per 1 million doses, but that the benefits of immunization outweigh the risks.

Health experts have long been nervous to speak about risks associated with vaccines. This is because the vaccine benefits are great and the risks are small, with adverse reactions usually occurring in vulnerable populations, such as those with certain allergies or pre-existing nervous system disorders. [5 Dangerous Vaccination Myths]

Flu vaccines, in particular, save millions of lives. Influenza will kill on average about a half-million people worldwide annually, including up to 40,000 in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Flu pandemics will kill millions.

Sometimes vaccine risks are real and high because of a bad batch of drugs. A prime example is the Cutter Incident in 1955, in which the polio vaccine accidentally contained a live virus that infected 40,000 children, leading to 55 cases of paralysis and five deaths. This nearly destroyed the public's confidence in vaccines at the dawn of polio eradication.

Sometimes, however, reports of vaccine risks turn out to be false and based on fabricated science, such as the link between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. Measles and also whooping cough have had resurgences as a result of low vaccination rates brought on by this scare.

Thus, many health experts do not readily concede to vaccine risks when confronted with them. And Guillain–Barré syndrome haunts many like a specter.

Guillain–Barré syndrome is a serious peripheral nerve disease that can cause partial paralysis, breathing difficulties and death. Most patients recover after several months to a year, although not always fully. GBS is associated with Campylobacter jejuni, the food-borne bacterium, and several viruses; but for most cases, the immediate cause is not known, according to the CDC. [Top 10 Mysterious Diseases]

During the 1976 swine flu outbreak in the United States, health authorities reported an unusually high number of GBS cases, nearly 1,100 — half of which occurred after immunization against the flu. Panic ensued, and the vaccine program ended by December that year.

Doctors debated the connection then, and it took nearly 30 years before the prestigious U.S.-based Institute of Medicine concluded in 2003 that there was a causal relationship and that one extra person out of a million contracted GBS as a result of the vaccination.

The results of the new Quebec study on the 2009 H1N1 flu strain of swine origin are eerily similar to the conclusions drawn from the dozens of studies on the 1976 swine flu outbreak. Is there something about vaccines for flu strains of swine origin that can trigger GBS?

A much larger study published in February 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine examined nearly 90 million doses of H1N1 vaccine in China and concluded that the answer was no. Doctors there found only 11 cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, which actually is far lower than the natural rate.

So, one debate will continue: whether there is a small but real link between swine flu vaccines and GBS. But few if any reputable doctors will argue that the flu vaccine is dangerous or not worthwhile for most people, from infants to the elderly. In fact, a study published in the same issue of JAMA finds the H1N1 vaccine is safe for pregnant women.

Researchers dug into the world of anti-vaccination people — better known as anti-vaxxers — by looking at data from six of the largest, public anti-vaxxer pages on Facebook. By analyzing two years' worth of data from these pages, the researchers determined that these communities are extremely active, negative in tone and primarily female.

""Social media plays an important role in making anti-vaccination beliefs durable and persistent,"" study lead researcher Naomi Smith, a lecturer in sociology at Federation University Australia, told Live Science. ""Sharing posts is an important way to spread this type of information, so be careful before you share any post that claims vaccines make people sick."" [5 Dangerous Vaccination Myths]

Over the past two decades, childhood vaccines have saved the lived of 732,000 U.S. children and prevented more than 300 million kids from getting sick, a 2014 study from the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) found, Live Science previously reported.

Yet despite these impressive statistics, vaccines have faced opposition from the time they were invented in the late 1700s. This opposition continues today, including from people who suspect the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine causes autism (it doesn't) or that the aluminum salts added to some vaccines are dangerous (these salts enhance the body's immune response, and studies show they're safe, according to the CDC). Other people delay vaccinations because they mistakenly believe that the recommended vaccination schedule can overwhelm a child's immune system, Live Science previously reported.

To get a better idea of how anti-vaxxer Facebook communities function, Smith and co-researcher Tim Graham, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Australian National University, who has a joint appointment in the Research School of Social Science and the Research School of Computer Science, dug into the groups' posts, likes, shares and comments. They found the following:
• Anti-vaxxer posts are highly shared, meaning that people frequently ""shared"" posts on their own Facebook pages or on their friends' pages, Smith said. In all, there were more than 2 million shares across the six groups during the two-year period, she said. ""This means that the page's reach is much greater than the number of people who 'like' it,"" Smith said.
• Participants were moderately active across several anti-vaccination Facebook pages, ""suggesting that users' activity on anti-vaccination is more than just a product of Facebook's recommender system"" — a system that recommends like-minded groups to people, Smith said.
• Despite their large size and high levels of activity, anti-vaccination groups are relatively loose-knit. ""That is, they do not necessarily function as close-knit communities of support with participants interacting with each other in a sustained way over time,"" Smith said. [Top 10 Golden Rules of Facebook]
• Even though they are ""loose,"" these groups show features of ""small-world"" networks. ""In small- world networks, information diffuses quickly and easily through the network, in this instance through user-generated comments,"" Smith said. However, it's difficult to say whether these small-world effects are due to the nature of the anti-vaxxer movement itself, or are an artifact of Facebook, a platform that can help spread information quickly, Smith said.
• The sentiments expressed in these Facebook pages were ""quite negative in tone, suggesting that users of the anti-vaccination pages feel not only morally outraged about the practice of vaccination, but structurally oppressed by seemingly tyrannical and conspiratorial government and media,"" Smith said. Moreover, many posts had conspiracy-style beliefs placing blame on the government and media, Smith said. A 2011 survey found that conspiracy-style thinking is common among the general public and more pronounced in anti-vaxxers, a 2014 study in the American Journal of Political Science found.
• Anti-vaxxers had concerns about state-sanctioned harm and interference with their autonomy. ""In particular, anti-vaccination Facebook pages commonly compare vaccination to the Holocaust, illustrating a strong sense of persecution,"" Smith said.

Despite the paucity of evidence supporting anti-vaxxer beliefs, ""it’s important to not make fun of anti-vaccination attitudes,"" she said. ""This will likely reinforce any sense of persecution they feel.""

The study was published online Dec. 27 in the journal Information, Communication and Society."

The World Health Organization advises people to keep a distance of “at least one meter,” while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommends that they stay “at least six feet,” or two meters, apart.

“It will be much riskier to go to one meter,” said Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, who is a member of the government advisory panel. “If the government were honest with the public, they would say, ‘This is a riskier strategy, but we’re taking it anyway because of economic reasons.’”

Indeed, other parts of Britain are diverging from England. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are making their own decisions on when to ease the lockdown, with Scotland and Wales moving more slowly than England.

Mr. Johnson is expected to announce further measures this week to loosen the country’s 14-day quarantine on visitors by negotiating quarantine-free travel corridors between Britain and several European countries. That comes after intense lobbying from the embattled airline and tourism industries.

Britain imposed its lockdown in late March, far later than its neighbors, and it has been more cautious about lifting it, in part because it suffered one of the worst outbreaks of any Western country. Nearly 43,000 people have died; Mr. Johnson himself survived a serious bout of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus."

Edgar Maddison Welch’s “ill-conceived plot” last year did “actual damage to the lives of real people,” a judge said before sentencing him to four years in prison.

Judge Ketanji B. Jackson said she’d never seen a case like Welch’s, and she gave him a punishment on the upper end of guidelines, in part to send a message to others. If Welch believed an internet conspiracy theory that children were being harmed at the restaurant, he should have notified law enforcement, not attempted to take the law into his own hands, the judge said during Thursday’s hearing in U.S. District Court in Washington.

Jackson said it was “sheer luck” that no one was physically injured when Welch entered Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant on Dec. 4 armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a revolver. He was there just about a month after the election of President Donald Trump to investigate unfounded internet rumors about prominent Democrats harboring child sex slaves at the restaurant.

As diners and staff fled, leaving half-eaten pizza and cups of soda, Welch went through the restaurant. At one point, he fired his AR-15 at a locked closet, but he discovered there were no children being held in the restaurant and surrendered peacefully.

Welch’s sentence was just below the 4 ½ years prosecutors sought and above the 1 ½ years Welch’s attorney asked for.

During the hearing, the 29-year-old Welch spoke briefly to apologize, saying he realized that his words “cannot undo or change what already happened.” In a letter filed with the court, he wrote that he is “truly sorry for endangering the safety of any and all bystanders who were present that day,” but he didn’t talk about the conspiracy theory that motivated him to act, saying just that he came to Washington “with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance.”

On Thursday, he sat quietly in an orange jail jumpsuit throughout most of the hearing as his mother, father, sister and fiancée sat in the front of the courtroom.

Welch’s attorney, Dani Jahn, said that Welch’s actions were “reckless” and “misguided,” but she said Welch, a father and former emergency medical technician, had acted with the intent of defending children.

Welch, who is from Salisbury, North Carolina, pleaded guilty in March to interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition and assault with a dangerous weapon. Though the rumors he went to investigate were unfounded, they have upended the lives of those who worked in the restaurant.

The restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, said in court that the “viscous web of lies” about his business has been traumatic for him and his staff. He still needs security there, he said, and has suffered both emotionally and financially. In letters to the judge and in court, employees described the terror of Welch’s actions, with some saying they have depression and nightmares and need trauma counseling.

But Alefantis also said he is hopeful.

“I am hopeful that those who provoke fear, traffic in lies and perpetuate conspiracy will awake to the tangible harms that result from their actions,” he said in court. “I am hopeful that one day reason will prevail before a shot rings out again in a place of warmth and love and communal gathering.”"

The WHO chief was addressing journalists listening in to his latest virtual briefing on the crisis, where he was joined by the head of the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, and a top official from the global vaccine alliance, GAVI.

Child mortality rates have dropped by half over the past 20 years, largely due to safe, effective vaccination.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic means routine immunization services are now substantially hindered in nearly 70 countries, with roughly 80 million children under a year old, likely to be affected.

As UNICEF chief Henrietta Fore explained, vaccination campaigns have dwindled for several reasons, including implementation of measures to contain coronavirus spread, redeployment of health personnel to treat COVID-19 patients, and “serious disruption” to supply chains and transport routes.

Parents have also been reluctant, or unable, to go to vaccination sites due to fears surrounding transmission, or because of movement restrictions.

“However, we cannot let our fight against one disease come at the expense of long-term progress in our fight against other diseases”, she said.

“We cannot exchange one deadly outbreak for another. We cannot afford to lose the decades of health gains that everyone has worked so hard to achieve.”

Despite the dire news, some countries such as Afghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire and Laos, are forging ahead with vaccine programmes, according to Seth Berkley, Chief Executive Officer at GAVI.

The Vaccine Alliance has helped lower-income countries save more than 13 million lives since its inception in 2000.

“Recent modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine shows that if you were to try to avoid getting COVID by stopping routine immunization, for every COVID death prevented you would have more than 100 deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases”, he said.

Globally, there were more than five million COVID-19 cases as of Friday, and more than 320,000 deaths.

GAVI stands ready to support what Mr. Berkley called “the mass vaccine catch-up campaigns”, to protect children unable to be immunized because of the pandemic.

The United Kingdom will host the Global Vaccine Summit on 4 June with the goal of securing $7.4 billion to cover GAVI’s work over the next five years.

The funding will be enough to vaccinate 300 million additional children worldwide, preventing at least another seven million deaths.

Pledges have been received so far from numerous countries including the UK, the United States, Norway, Germany, Canada, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Spain."

In a proof-of-principle experiment they created an ""air waveguide"" that could one day be used as an instantaneous optical fibre to any point on earth, or even into space.

The findings, reported in the journal Optica, have applications in long range laser communications, high-resolution topographic mapping, air pollution and climate change research, and could also be used by the military to make laser weapons.

""People have been thinking about making air waveguides for a while, but this is the first time it's been realized,"" said Howard Milchberg of the University of Maryland, who led the research, which was funded by the U.S. military and National Science Foundation.

Lasers lose intensity and focus with increasing distance as photons naturally spread apart and interact with atoms and molecules in the air.

Fibre optics solves this problem by beaming the light through glass cores with a high refractive index, which is good for transmitting light.

The core is surrounded by material with a lower refractive index that reflects light back in to the core, preventing the beam from losing focus or intensity.

Fibre optics, however, are limited in the amount of power they can carry and the need for a physical structure to support them.

Milchberg and colleagues' made the equivalent of an optical fibre out of thin air by generating a laser with its light split into a ring of multiple beams forming a pipe.

They used very short and powerful pulses from the laser to heat the air molecules along the beam extremely quickly.

Such rapid heating produced sound waves that took about a microsecond to converge to the centre of the pipe, creating a high-density area surrounded by a low-density area left behind in the wake of the laser beams.

""A microsecond is a long time compared to how far light propagates, so the light is gone and a microsecond later those sound waves collide in the centre, enhancing the air density there,"" says Milchberg.

The lower density region of air surrounding the centre of the air waveguide had a lower refractive index, keeping the light focused.

""Any structure [even air] which has a higher density will have a higher index of refraction and thereby act like an optical fibre,"" says Milchberg.

Once Milchberg and colleagues created their air waveguide, they used a second laser to spark the air at one end of the waveguide turning it into plasma.

An optical signal from the spark was transmitted along the air waveguide, over a distance of a metre to a detector at the other end.

The signal collected by the detector was strong enough to allow Milchberg and colleagues to analyze the chemical composition of the air that produced the spark.

The researchers found the signal was 50 per cent stronger than a signal obtained without an air waveguide.

The findings show the air waveguide can be used as a ""remote collection optic,"" says Milchberg.

""This is an optical fibre cable that you can reel out at the speed of light and place next to [something] that you want to measure remotely, and have the signal come all the way back to where you are.""

Australian expert Ben Eggleton of the University of Sydney says this is potentially an important advance for the field of optics.

""It's sort of like you have an optical fibre that you can shine into the sky, connecting your laser to the top of the atmosphere,"" says Eggleton.

""You don't need big lenses and optics, it's already guided along this channel in the atmosphere."""

But the ""Trump bump"" has stalled a bit as the new administration wraps up a rocky first 100 days.

Still, over the past six decades, stock-market rallies in the early days of a change of administration aren't necessarily a great predictor of investor returns over the full term of the incoming president. The stock market's jubilant response to Trump's election was initially compared to the reaction to Ronald Reagan's 1980 defeat of Jimmy Carter. Both Trump and Reagan campaigned on a platform that promised sweeping deregulation, a prospect that investors assume will help companies boost profits. Reagan's post-election rally fizzled within weeks, though, thanks to an aggressive series of interest-rate hikes in late 1980 aimed at snuffing out double-digit inflation. Between Election Day and the end of the year, short-term rates surged from 14 percent to just more than 20 percent.

Stock investors were ultimately rewarded by the Reagan administration, which followed through on its promises with major deregulation of industries such as telecommunications, among others. But those returns were sharply curtailed by the crash of 1987, which wiped out more than 25 percent of the market's value in a week. The biggest market rally for a change in administration followed the swearing-in of Lyndon Johnson after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963, which sparked a sharp sell-off. Within weeks, the market had recovered and continued to move higher. The Kennedy administration had gotten off to a strong start. In the first 100 days after the inauguration in January 1961, stocks jumped by 18.5 percent as the U.S. economy shook off the economic drag from a recession that ended a month after Kennedy took office. President Barack Obama had the worst first 100 days of any postwar president, as the stock market and the economy were in the throes of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

His predecessor, George W. Bush, also had a rocky start to his first term, after taking office in the middle of a major bear market sparked by the unwinding of the 2000s tech bubble. That bubble helped Bill Clinton chalk up the best stock-market performance of the last 11 presidents. During his eight years in office, the S&P 500 index soared from 433 to 1,343, a gain of more than 200 percent. Obama turned in the second-best stock-market performance, despite the financial crisis that was raging at the start of his presidency. The market lost another 15 percent during his first two months in office before bottoming out. As of Thursday, the S&P 500 was up 181 percent since he was first inaugurated in January 2009. The financial crisis left his predecessor with the worst stock market record of the last 11 presidents. The second Bush administration was briefly in positive territory during the second term, but those gains were more than wiped out by the crisis of 2008."

Why invest millions of pounds in developing a vaccine that will protect us from Covid-19 when the perfect protection from infection is right there in your kitchen cabinet? That’s right, it’s time to start sculpting tinfoil hats to ward off those Coronavirus-inducing 5G signals.

“Tin foil hat brigade” is an expression used to dismiss virtually anyone who believes, without any evidence whatever, all the far out theories so beloved of modern social media users. Whether it’s oil fields in the North Sea that Whitehall wants to keep secret in order to convince Scots that we’re poorer than we actually are, or that the security services organised the 7/7 bombings on London’s transport infrastructure in 2005 to justify a draconian clampdown on civil liberties, “tin foil hats” is a useful shorthand expression that conveys exactly the right amount of derision and contempt for people who wish to broadcast their lower-than-average IQs, or at least their higher-then-average gullibility.

But now coronavirus has gifted us an actual, literal tin foil hat scenario. The myth being propagated is that somehow, presumably via a process of alchemy and magic, masts erected to transmit 5G phone signals are actually being used to spread a virus. Assuming you’re unable to join the hordes of torch-wielding villagers hell-bent on setting fire to these masts before they can steal our very souls (and, ideally, burning human sacrifices inside a giant Wicker Man while they’re at it), then coating your skull with some form of tough but flexible metallic material is the very thing. I mean, if they work as well as they did to protect wearers from the effects of chemtrails, then we’ll all be A-OK."

Worse, if you don’t like the term “brainwashing,” then what will you call the violent conversion therapy currently practiced on hundreds of thousands of concentration camp detainees in Xinjiang?

Even if Mitchell is right that “the term is used frequently by ideologues of all stripes to define the opinions of those whom they disagree with as the result of external mind control rather than an independent thought process,” how is it remotely possible to even write on this topic without touching on the massive campaign forcing people at gunpoint, in the Xinjiang camps, to regurgitate CCP dogma and then denounce themselves and deny their identity day out and day in — as copiously documented by numerous witnesses — surely a full-throated contemporary revival of Maoist CCP torture-brainwashing?

The idea of “an independent thought process” as an alternate explanation for why people change their mind, whatever its usefulness elsewhere, cannot be a suitable framework for understanding the fate of Chinese dissenters paraded on TV when their CCP torturers have tormented them enough to be satisfied with their parroting performance, — or, worse, for understanding the fate of the thousands of people now being reduced to broken zombies in the Xinjiang camps.

I would have thought that it should be impossible for any scholar free to speak their mind, to touch on this topic of brainwashing today without touching on these dramatic current developments so obviously rooted in the undeniable – whatever you want to call it.

This article, in purposefully omitting what is happening today, and refusing to touch on how the massive crimes of today are so obviously built on the past torture practices under Mao, refashioned to target dissenters and ethnic minorities today – in effect sidelining such questions by suggesting it is all somehow about cold war residues – to me comes across as intellectually dishonest.

Sorry if I am blunt here, but we live today, and we must face the horrors of today, not hide from them – or hide them under a “Cold War” carpet."

This has become painfully clear as the Senate wrestles with whether to approve as new CIA director a highly qualified candidate who, nonetheless, is also a veteran of that dark period in our nation's past.

Gina Haspel has served 33 years with the agency, most of it clandestinely, and would be the first female director, certainly a welcome inspiration to other women in a male-dominated field.

OTHER VIEWS: Haspel's CIA career and our national security

Given her résumé of experience and achievements, Haspel might very well be, as Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said last week, the most qualified person nominated for the job in the CIA's 70 years. Glowing accolades have flowed from former agency chiefs under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Leon Panetta, who ran the CIA when it located Osama bin Laden in 2011, told us that Haspel would fearlessly speak ""truth to power"" for a president not always receptive to unvarnished fact.

Perhaps most important, she has promised — though it took persistent questioning during her confirmation hearing last week — that even if President Trump ordered her to resume waterboarding (simulated drowning) and other acts of torture, she would refuse.

The threat of such an order is no idle conjecture. Trump boasted as a candidate of reimposing waterboarding and ""a hell of a lot worse."" Among his first acts as president was drafting a sweeping order that, if he ever signed it, would start a process of reopening overseas ""black sites"" such as those where torture was carried out.

All of which might shed light on why he chose Haspel as his nominee — and also on why her selection is not, to quote former CIA director George Tenet in a different context, a ""slam dunk.""

Haspel operated one of those black sites in 2002, when more attacks were feared in the aftermath of 9/11. Congress has since banned the brutal interrogation practices, and she testified Wednesday that she supports this ""stricter moral standard."" But during that same hearing, she could not bring herself to characterize the waterboarding carried out under her command in 2002, and scores of other times by the CIA, as immoral.

The Washington Post has reported that in the past she was an ""enthusiastic supporter"" of the CIA's interrogation program. Haspel also played a role in the CIA's infamous ""extraordinary rendition program"" that allowed for captured militants to be turned over to foreign governments for torture.

In 2005, she participated in the destruction of video evidence of brutal interrogations. She drafted a cable sent out by her boss ordering the shredding of more than 90 videotapes. The action was done without the CIA director's approval and despite White House opposition. An internal investigation later found Haspel blameless.

And there is much more the public doesn't know. Haspel, as acting CIA director, has released few specifics about herself except for some flattering details. Americans are left to largely trust her supporters. Three committee Democrats who reviewed her classified background say they found disturbing details.

In the final analysis, the decision to approve Haspel as the next CIA director is fraught — a tough call for all but reflexive partisans. As a consequence, the USA TODAY Editorial Board, which reflects a diversity of viewpoints and operates by consensus, failed to reach one about her nomination.

It's anyone's guess who Trump might choose in the unlikely event that the Senate rejects her nomination. Given her vast experience, she would undoubtedly hit the ground running and have substantial support within the agency.

She remains, however, inextricably linked to a shameful period. ""The methods we employ to keep our nation safe must be as right and just as the values we aspire to live up to and promote in the world,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was tortured while he was a prisoner of North Vietnam, said last week in arguing against Haspel's nomination.

The Senate's duty is to carefully weigh her qualifications against the message her confirmation would send to other nations, to U.S. servicemembers who might face moral dilemmas in the battlefield and to future generations of Americans.

As the child of a pediatrician, I often went with my father on house calls. I’ll always remember the patient confined to an iron lung because of polio. She was a young woman, probably still an adolescent. When polio paralyzes muscle groups in the chest, a patient is unable to breath. She could have easily died.

During my own medical training, I cared for a child with encephalitis from measles and as an attending physician treated a boy who almost died from epiglottitis, which causes swelling that can block air from getting to the lungs. I’ve cared for children struggling with pertussis, better known as whooping cough. While assistant director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), I saw diseases ravage communities.

Polio, measles, epiglottitis, pertussis — all preventable by immunizations. As a pediatrician, I have experienced the supreme joy of seeing childhood diseases that had caused such suffering and loss in earlier generations become absolutely preventable, consigned to history.

Australia is about to eradicate cervical cancer, US is nowhere close. What'll it take?

But this amazing public health success story is being undercut by the modern anti-vaccination movement, which was built on discredited research published in 1998 that associated the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine with autism.

When the WHO certified the international eradication of smallpox in 1980, measles became the leading vaccine-preventable killer of children globally. In addition to being one of the world’s most serious infectious diseases, measles is also one of the most contagious.

The virus can linger for up to two hours in the air of an enclosed space where an infected person has been. If you carry the measles virus, 90 percent of those near you who have not been vaccinated will also become infected.

Nineteen years ago, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared measles eliminated in the United States because more than a year had gone by without continuous transmission of the disease. But we now face a renewed threat from a woefully familiar adversary.

Across New York state, the vaccination rate for two doses of the MMR vaccine among children is 96 percent. As health commissioner, I can assure you that this is a high and safe threshold. But when people who refuse immunization cluster geographically, communities become extremely vulnerable despite an overall high rate of vaccination. And because measles remains endemic in certain parts of the world, global travelers can expose those who are unvaccinated here at home.

According to the CDC, 2018 saw the second highest number of reported cases of measles in the United States since 2010, with 372 cases. The WHO has named vaccine hesitancy as one of the greatest threats to public health in 2019.

New York has taken unprecedented steps to ensure the health and safety of all its residents. We have high immunization rates overall, but recent outbreaks of preventable diseases illustrate the significant public health threat posed by willful disregard of the efficacy and science of vaccination.

Last fall, New York experienced one of its most significant measles outbreaks in decades, with more than 200 cases across the state. Cases in Rockland County and Brooklyn were concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities and traced to travelers returning from Israel, where measles outbreaks have been prevalent.

On the opposite side of the country, Washington state is working to contain a still-unfolding measles outbreak. In just the first month of 2019, the CDC has tracked measles cases in New York and Washington as well as in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon and Texas. The number of cases per state may be small, but it’s still 20 percent of our nation's states grappling with measles at the same time.

When the first measles cases were reported last fall, the New York State Department of Health (DOH) rapidly mobilized to help prevent secondary cases. But the outbreak showed us that it’s not just skepticism of legitimate scientific data that has fueled anti-vaccination behaviors. Other factors include disbelief in the seriousness of measles and other childhood diseases, as well as large families of unvaccinated children, who can amplify the potential for spread.

To eliminate the gaps and get New York’s immunization rates even closer to 100 percent, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and DOH are considering narrowing the state’s school vaccination exemptions. California, Mississippi and West Virginia have a narrow range of exemptions. We have been carefully analyzing the community health impacts of exemptions to ensure that whatever exemptions New York allows are scientifically valid and easy to monitor.

We also want to close the vaccination gaps that result from other factors. We can do this by requiring the influenza vaccine for children in day care facilities and preschools, requiring that postsecondary students be immunized against meningococcal disease, making camp access contingent on immunization, and removing barriers to participating in immunization registries.

As the fourth most populous state in the union, New York has remained vigilant against the spread of communicable diseases. We hope other states share our belief in making community immunity a public health priority. That means working closely with county health officials as we have in our recent outbreak, and educating parents to help them get to the place where everyone is working to ensure the child’s health.

With measures like the ones New York is pursuing, we can protect our country not just from the diseases themselves, but also from human misconceptions that can bring deadly diseases back from the grave.

The study authors found that in the U.S. there were 20 times more deaths per week from COVID-19 than from the flu in the deadliest week of an average influenza season.

""Although officials may say that SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] is 'just another flu,' this is not true,"" the authors, from Harvard Medical School and Emory University

School of Medicine, wrote in their paper, published today (May 14) in the journal .

Related: How does the new coronavirus compare with the flu?

Ever since the new coronavirus was discovered in early January, people have compared it with the flu, pointing out that influenza causes tens of thousands of deaths every year in the U.S. alone. Indeed, during the current flu season, the estimates that there were up to 62,000 flu deaths in the U.S. from October 2019 through April 2020.

At a glance, this may appear similar to the toll of COVID-19, which as of early May, had caused about 65,000 U.S. deaths. (As of Thursday, May 13, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. was more than 82,000, according to .)

But this doesn't match what health care providers are seeing on the frontlines of the pandemic, particularly in hot zones (such as New York City), ""where ventilators have been in short supply and many hospitals have been stretched beyond their limits,"" the authors said.

This comparison is flawed because the CDC estimates of flu deaths are just that — estimates rather than raw numbers. The CDC does not know the exact number of people who become sick with or die from the flu each year in the U.S. Rather, this number is estimated based on data collected on flu hospitalizations through surveillance in 13 states.On the other hand, reported COVID-19 deaths are actual counts of people who died from COVID-19, not estimates. In other words, comparing estimates of flu deaths with raw counts of COVID-19 deaths is like comparing ""apples to oranges,"" the authors said.

So for the new study, the researchers looked at actual counts of flu deaths per week, and compared those with counts of COVID-19 deaths.

Based on data from death certificates, during the deadliest week of flu season over the last several years, the counted number of U.S. deaths due to flu ranged from 351 during the 2015 to 2016 flu season to 1,626 during the 2017 to 2018 flu season, the authors said. The average number of flu deaths during the week of peak flu mortality in recent seasons (from 2013 to 2020) was 752 deaths.

In contrast, for COVID-19, there were 15,455 deaths reported in the U.S. during the week ending April 21 (the highest weekly death toll during the pandemic so far) the authors said

That means that the number of COVID-19 deaths for the week ending April 21 was about 10- to 40-fold higher than the number of influenza deaths for the most lethal week of the past seven flu seasons. That peak COVID-19 weekly death count is about 20 times higher than the average weekly peak flu death count, the authors said.

The authors note that their analysis has some limitations, including that the number of COVID-19 deaths may be undercounted because of limitations with testing for SARS-CoV-2 and false-negative test results. In addition, the authors point out that adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to public health authorities in the way that COVID-19 deaths are, potentially undercounting flu deaths as well.

Still, ""our analysis suggests that comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 mortality and seasonal influenza mortality must be made using an apples-to-apples comparison, not an apples-to-oranges comparison,"" the authors concluded. ""Doing so better demonstrates the true threat to public health from COVID-19.""

""It would look like it was taken by a hidden camera,"" said one. ""Very grainy, like it was a secret videotaping of a sex session.""

Another scheme was to break into Iraqi television stations with a bogus news bulletin in which a Saddam lookalike would announce that he was stepping down.

The double would say he was to be replaced by his son Uday, a notorious sadist and libertine widely despised by Iraqis.

""I'm sure you will throw your support behind His Excellency Uday,"" the fake Saddam would say.

The ideas were developed by the CIA's Iraq Operations Group in collaboration with its Office of Technical Services.

According to the officer, the CIA did make a video apparently showing Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda lieutenants sitting beside a campfire quaffing bottles of alcoholic drinks and discussing their sexual trysts with boys. The actors were drawn from ""some of us darker-skinned employees"".

The ideas were strongly opposed by James Pavitt, then head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, the spy agency's clandestine division.

A second former CIA officer said the plots were obviously ludicrous and ""came from people whose careers were spent in Latin America or East Asia"" and did not understand the Middle East.

A third former officer said: ""Saddam playing with boys would have no resonance in the Middle East – nobody cares.

Allen Ginsberg, beat poet and icon of the counterculture, and Richard Helms, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 1966-1973, during the most controversial years of the Vietnam War. But in March 1971, in a drawing room of the Corcoran Gallery in Washington DC, the two came face to face in a fittingly bizarre encounter.

Ginsberg, due to give a reading at the gallery that evening, approached Helms with a wager. He told Helms that he suspected the CIA of being involved in the illegal opium trade in South-East Asia. If he was right about this controversial allegation, Ginsberg proposed that Helms should agree to meditate for one hour every day for the rest of his life. “It is terribly important to get him into an improved mind-consciousness,” Ginsberg later told reporters.

But if Ginsberg was wrong, and Helms could demonstrate the innocence of his agency, then Ginsberg agreed to gift Helms his Vajra, a brass Buddhist-Hindu ritual instrument that symbolised “the lightning doctrine of sudden illumination”. Confident that, on this score at least, the CIA had nothing to hide, Helms agreed to the bargain.

A year later, Ginsberg sent Helms a clipping from the Far Eastern Review that reported a number of sightings by journalists of piles of raw opium being readied for sale in full view of CIA agents. A January 1972 exposé in Ramparts Magazine, which five years earlier had first exposed details of the CIA’s infiltration of the National Students’ Association, lent further credence to Ginsberg’s charges.

Accompanying the clippings, a smug Ginsberg sent Helms some notes and advice on meditation techniques, including guidance on appropriate posture and breathing:

Perhaps more troubling for Helms though, particularly at a time of mounting public suspicion of the CIA, was the publicity that Ginsberg gave to these allegations.

A few months after their encounter Ginsberg wrote an open letter to Senator Clifford P Hansen asking him to investigate the matter. Hansen refused, and instead issued a firm rebuttal in an open letter that was drafted for him by the CIA’s public affairs staff.

But Ginsberg wasn’t one to give up. The following winter, he raised the issue again, this time on television, as a guest on the Dick Cavett Show. And then in March 1972 Ginsberg published the first draft of his ever-evolving poem “CIA Dope Calypso” in an issue of Earth Magazine that contained a series of damning articles about the CIA by other authors. The poem ends:

The poem drew heavily from the analysis of Alfred W McCoy, a graduate student at Yale who was commissioned by Harper and Row to write a study of the purported heroin epidemic in Vietnam. Ginsberg had met McCoy at a rally in New Haven to free Black Panther leader Huey P Newton. “His vision was expansive and poetic, while mine was historical and documentarian,” recalled McCoy:

McCoy’s book, based on more than 250 interviews with heroin dealers, police officials, and former French and American intelligence agents was published later that year as The Politics of Heroin in South-East Asia. Needless to say, it supported Ginsberg’s accusation that the CIA were complicit in the opium trade.

When the CIA found out about McCoy’s book after he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they took strong objection to it. Cord Meyer, the CIA’s deputy director of plans, was sent to pay a visit to Harper and Row’s offices in New York and petitioned the publisher to share the galley proofs with them prior to publication. Reluctantly, Harper and Row consented.

But the CIA’s intervention backfired. Against their objections, Harper and Row chose to publish the work in full, and sped up the production of the book by a month to cash in on the controversy. “I had hoped that my work would be interesting enough to spark a public debate,” McCoy later wrote, “now the CIA, by attempting to suppress it, has itself sparked the debate”. After it was published, Ginsberg was often seen marching at protests with a copy on his head, exclaiming “he had something on his mind”.

It was not the first time the CIA had been subjected to Ginsberg’s particular brand of activist irreverence. During the trial of the “Ann Arbor Three”, a group of White Panther activists accused of blowing up a CIA recruitment station in Michigan, Ginsberg appeared as a defence witness, proclaiming himself as the spokesperson for all young people under the age of 28 in his vociferous opposition to the CIA (a claim that was vigorously rejected by the prosecution).

But perhaps there was a grain of truth in Ginsberg’s somewhat tongue-in-cheek exaggeration. Though he certainly couldn’t claim to speak for the silent majority that swept Richard Nixon into a second term of office just a few weeks after the publication of McCoy’s book, he was undoubtedly one of the most high-profile representatives of the American counterculture and anti-war movement.

As a result, he played a small but significant role in raising the American public’s suspicions about their most secretive foreign intelligence agency at a time of immense discord and social upheaval. And, in the process, he helped to cement the CIA’s place in American culture as a lightning rod for wider public anxieties regarding secrecy and the excesses of US foreign policy."

Nostradamus left his footprint on history in the year 1555 with his greatest written work, the Les Propheties – a book which conspiracy theorists think holds the secrets of the future. Among his greatest accomplishments, Nostradamus’ supporters believe he predicted the Great Fire of London in 1666 and the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933. And many doomsayers who study Nostradamus’ works for prophecies of the world’s demise, believe there are some cataclysmic events yet to pass.

Among Nostradamus’ most chilling warnings is the supposed outbreak of World War 3 sometime in the future. Conspiracists point to one cryptic passage penned by Nostradamus, which is believed to describe a conflict between global powers. The passage in question reads: “Twice put up and twice cast down, the East will also weaken the West. Its adversary after several battles chased by sea will fail at time of need.” “The great man will be struck down in the day by a thunderbolt. An evil deed, foretold by the bearer of a petition.

“According to the prediction another falls at night time. Conflict at Reims, London, and pestilence in Tuscany.” Another Nostradamus passage suggests a global war lasting 27 years will break out in Europe and ravage the continent. The passage states: “The big war will start in France and all Europe will be attacked, It will be long and terrifying for everyone. “And then finally there will be peace but only a few will enjoy it, A war will start between the two great world powers and it will last for a period of 27 years.""

Another passage from Nostradamus’ Quatrain 8.16 mentions a great flood covering the land from where the mythological Jason built his ship. It reads: “At the place where Jason has his ship built, So great a flood shall come so suddenly. “One shall not have place or land to attach, The wave shall mount to Olympic Fesulan.” Some believe the flood will be the result of an asteroid crashing into the Mediterranean Sea – a reference to Jason, the ancient Greek hero.

The rise of Mabus the Antichrist According to Nostradamus, the literal personification of evil will arrive on Earth in the form of Mabus the Antichrist. If John Hogue, a book author on Nostradamus’ prophecies is correct, Mabus could be already roaming the Earth freely. The author said Mabus’ arrival was prophesied in Century 10, Quatrain 72, which points towards the year 1999. The passage reads: “The year 1999, seventh month, From the sky will come a great King of Terror: “To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols, Before and after Mars to reign by good luck.” But the real danger will come when Mabus dies – an event which will trigger the outbreak of World War 3. When this happens, a war against the “three Eastern kings” will engulf the world in turmoil."

The measure passed the state Senate health committee by a vote of 6-2, the bill’s co-author, Democrat Richard Pan, said in a statement.

“I’ve personally witnessed the suffering caused by vaccine-preventable diseases, and all children deserve to be safe at school,” said Pan, who is also a pediatrician.

“The personal belief exemption is now putting other school children and people in our community in danger.”

Pan proposed the bill, which would leave in place medical exemptions to vaccinations, in the wake of a major measles outbreak in the state that began at Disneyland in December.

All told, more than 150 people across the United Sates have been diagnosed with measles in recent months, 126 of them in California.

The outbreak renewed debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side effects of vaccinations, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting a link to autism, prompted a small minority of parents to refuse them for their children.

The proposal, which must clear several other legislative hurdles before a possible Senate floor vote, prompted roughly four hours of heated discussion that saw several people removed for shouting down lawmakers, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported.

Detractors of the bill, including Republican senator Jim Nielsen who voted against it on Wednesday, said it tramples on a parent’s rights, the Bee reported.

“I have very profound feelings about parental rights and responsibilities and great dismay in American society over the decades how much that parental right, that parental responsibility has diminished,” Nielsen said, according to the newspaper.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 after years of intensive childhood vaccine efforts. But in 2014 the country had its highest number of cases in two decades.

There is no specific treatment for measles and most people recover within several weeks. But in poor and malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and pneumonia."

Employees were able to extinguish the blaze, which broke out Wednesday after 9 p.m., and no one was injured. Investigators discovered matches and lighter fluid on the floor of a back room where the fire started, The Washington Post reported, citing a police report.

The D.C. eatery was thrust into the spotlight after an Internet rumor alleged former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton were among a group of wealthy elites involved in an international sex slavery ring that was allegedly centered at the pizza joint. Some theorists believed emails from the account of 2016 Clinton campaign chair John Podesta contained codes known to pedophiles. Drawings inside Comet Ping Pong and photos from social media accounts belonging to the restaurant's owners were also used to support the far-fetched insinuation.

In June 2017, Edgar Maddison Welch was sentenced to four years in prison after he walked into the pizza shop armed with an AR-15 and a revolver to investigate the rumors. Welch fired his gun multiple times and, after finding no children held against their will, he surrendered to police.

The former president has spoken with Sanders several times over the last few weeks and reassured him that he had already done much of what he wanted to do, according to The New York Times.

Sanders started strong in the early Democratic primaries, but Joe Biden has dominated ever since and is will be the candidate to face off against President Trump in November.

The admitted Democratic socialist had battled Hillary Clinton hard during the 2016 race, and some believe that a lack of unity in the Dem party led to Donald Trump's victory nearly four years ago.

Obama ended his public silence on Tuesday by endorsing Biden, his former vice president. However, he apparently has been exerting his influence under the radar.

“Biden has obviously achieved something huge here on his own, but the president is a surrogate unlike anyone else anyone can bring to bear - I mean, who has Trump got?"" longtime Obama pollsterJoel Benenson told The Times.

“Getting to the point where he can get Obama involved, you know, that’s a big deal.”

Obama initially reached out to Sanders in late March, according to the newspaper, and he apparently has gotten through.

Sanders dropped out of the race earlier this month.

He said Tuesday that it would be “irresponsible” for his supporters not to support Biden, warning that progressives who “sit on their hands” would simply enable Trump's reelection.

""Do we be as active as we can in electing Joe Biden and doing everything we can to move Joe and his campaign in a more progressive direction?"" he said.

""Or do we choose to sit it out and allow the most dangerous president in modern American history to get reelected?”

He added that “I believe that it’s irresponsible for anybody to say, ‘Well, I disagree with Joe Biden - I disagree with Joe Biden! - and therefore I’m not going to be involved.’”

Sanders also distanced himself from his campaign's former press secretary Briahna Joy Gray, who refused to endorse Biden on social media.

“She is my former press secretary - not on the payroll,” Sanders said.

 Sanders dismissed questions about why he was willing to support Biden sooner than he did Clinton, whom he waited until June to endorse.

He told The Associated Press that recent conversations with Obama did not influence his decision, and that it came down to simple math.

“I will do everything I can to help elect Joe,"" Sanders said.

""We had a contentious campaign. We disagree on issues.

""But my job now is to not only rally my supporters, but to do everything I can to bring the party together to see that (Trump) is not elected president.”

Sanders added that “it’s probably a very fair assumption” that he would not run for president again.

It's a belief born not of selfishness but faith.

A small group of conservative Roman Catholics is pointing to a dozen biblical verses and the Church's original teaching as proof that the Earth is the center of the universe, the view that prompted Galileo Galilei's clash with the Church four centuries ago.

The relatively obscure movement has gained a following among a few Chicago-area Catholics who find comfort in knowing there are still staunch defenders of original Church doctrine.

""This subject is, as far as I can see, an embarrassment to the modern church because the world more or less looks upon geocentrism or someone who believes it in the same boat as the flat Earth,"" said James Phillips, of Cicero.

Phillips attends Our Lady Immaculate Catholic Church in Oak Park, a parish run by the Society of St. Pius X, a group that rejects most of the modernizing reforms the Vatican II council made from 1962 to 1965.

But by challenging modern science, the proponents of a geocentric universe are challenging the very church they seek to serve and protect.

""I have no idea who these people are. Are they sincere, or is this a clever bit of theater?"" said Brother Guy Consolmagno, the curator of meteorites and spokesman for the Vatican Observatory.

Indeed, those promoting geocentrism argue that heliocentrism, or the centuries-old consensus among scientists that the Earth revolves around the sun, is nothing more than a conspiracy theory to squelch the church's influence.

""Heliocentrism becomes 'dangerous' if it is being propped up as the true system when, in fact, it is a false system,"" said Robert Sungenis, leader of a budding movement to get scientists to reconsider. ""False information leads to false ideas, and false ideas lead to illicit and immoral actions — thus the state of the world today. … Prior to Galileo, the church was in full command of the world; and governments and academia were subservient to her.""

Sungenis is no lone Don Quixote, as illustrated by the hundreds of curiosity seekers, skeptics and supporters at a conference last fall titled ""Galileo Was Wrong. The Church Was Right"" just off the University of Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Ind.

Astrophysicists at Notre Dame didn't appreciate the group hitching its wagon to the prestige of America's flagship Catholic university and resurrecting a concept that's extinct for a reason.

""It's an idea whose time has come and gone,"" astrophysics professor Peter Garnavich said. ""There are some people who want to move the world back to the 1950s when it seemed like a better time. These are people who want to move the world back to the 1250s. I don't really understand it at all.""

Garnavich said the theory of geocentrism violates what he believes should be a strict separation of church and science. One answers why, the other answers how, and never the twain should meet, he said.

But supporters of the theory contend that there is scientific evidence to support geocentrism, just as there is evidence to support the six-day story of creation in Genesis.

There is proof in Scripture that the Earth is the center of the universe, Sungenis said. Among many verses, he cites Joshua 10:12-14 as definitive proof: ""And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, while the nation took vengeance on its foe. … The sun halted in the middle of the sky; not for a whole day did it resume its swift course.""

But Ken Ham, founder of the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Ky., said the Bible is silent on geocentrism.

""There's a big difference between looking at the origin of the planets, the solar system and the universe and looking at presently how they move and how they are interrelated,"" Ham said. ""The Bible is neither geocentric or heliocentric. It does not give any specific information about the structure of the solar system.""

Just as Ham challenges the foundation of natural history museums, Sungenis challenges planetariums, most notably the Vatican Observatory.

Consolmagno said the very premise of going after Galileo illustrates the theory's lack of scientific credibility.

""Of course, we understand the universe in a far more nuanced way than Galileo did 400 years ago,"" he said. ""And I would hope that the next 400 years would see just as much development.""

But Sungenis said the renewed interest in geocentrism is due, in part, to the efforts of Christians entering the scientific domain previously dominated by secularists. These Christian scientists, he said, showed modern science is without scientific foundation or even good evidence.

The issue has even sparked a debate between Art and Pat Jones, of Lyons. Pat Jones, a conservative Catholic who often attends Mass at Phillips' parish, said heliocentrism is part of a conspiracy.

""Because of our fallen nature in Christian terms, we take the line of least resistance — go with the flow,"" said Pat Jones. ""But the means of grace have to be intact.""

Her husband, Art, a self-described skeptical Protestant, says he is still a ""doubting Thomas"" but wouldn't put it past the orthodox science community to cook up a conspiracy. He accompanied his wife to the South Bend conference to learn more and ""keep peace in the family.""

Meanwhile, the theory has brought others like Phillips closer to God.

""I dropped my practice of faith,"" Phillips said. ""When I came back, it was a big wake-up call for me. … The world has its own dogmas."""

The tweets were just the latest manifestation of Trump’s preoccupation with eavesdropping and surveillance—one that can be traced back decades. As BuzzFeed’s Aram Roston reported last summer, during the mid-two-thousands, Trump kept a telephone console in his bedroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort, in Palm Beach, that allowed him to listen in on phone calls between his employees and, sometimes, staff and guests. (Trump denied this.) In the mid-nineteen-eighties, Trump allowed Tony Schwartz, his ghostwriter, to listen in on his private phone calls with bankers, lawyers, and developers, as Schwartz wrote “The Art of the Deal.” And, in the nineteen-seventies and eighties, many of Trump’s private conversations with his late mentor, the lawyer Roy Cohn, were eavesdropped on by Cohn’s longtime switchboard operator and courier, whose activities were later exposed."

""YOU WILL BURN IN HELL, BUSH!"" read one of the more family-friendly postings that appeared on the retired general's page this morning (March 11). ""KILL THE ILLUMINATI!"" the poster continued.

The offensive, all-caps postings have since been removed, but Sophos' Naked Security blog said the person responsible took the opportunity to repost some of the Bush family images that were distributed last month by a hacker who called himself ""Guccifer.""

""DON'T DELETE MY POSTS,"" the hacker pleaded, adding an expletive. ""LET ME SHOW THE BUSH PICTURES!!!!!!!!!!""

It's not clear if Guccifer was behind today's security breach.

As with the Bush family account breaches, Powell's Facebook page hack was probably the result of a poorly chosen account password.

Alternatively, Sophos' Graham Cluley theorizes, Powell may have used the same password and email address to register on another website, one that fell victim to a data breach in which usernames and passwords were compromised.

Both scenarios are easy to avoid by using strong, unique passwords on every online account, especially social networking, webmail and financial services sites.

In any case, the Powell page hijack didn't last long.

""Dear Friends, as most of you realize, my fb page has obviously been hacked. I'm sorry you have to see all the stupid, obscene posts that are popping up,"" Powell wrote on his Facebook page a couple of hours after the first offensive posting went up. ""Please ignore as we are working with fb to take care of this problem. I appreciate your patience."""

“Angels & Demons”, again starring Tom Hanks as Langdon and directed by Ron Howard, premieres in Rome on Monday at a theatre a mile away from Vatican City.

In the film, Langdon is recruited by the Vatican after the pope dies and four cardinals who are favourites to succeed him are kidnapped.

Langdon races through the “Eternal City” deciphering clues linked to a centuries-old secret society, the Illuminati.

“He is not the man the Vatican trusts — he is the man the Vatican needs,” Howard said in production notes for the movie.

Ewan McGregor plays the central role of the “Camerlengo”, or chamberlain, who runs the Vatican between the time of the pope’s death and the election of his successor.

“He sees himself as a man who will do whatever it takes to save the Church from the Illuminati and everything they represent,” McGregor said.

The film hits theatres in the United States on May 15.

Angels & Demons has so far avoided the kind of broadside the Vatican aimed at The Da Vinci Code film in 2005 and 2006 and the following year at “The Golden Compass” starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig.

“Dramatizing the issue involuntarily gives publicity to Angels & Demons,” said Archbishop Velasio De Paolis, in an interview with Italy’s La Stampa newspaper.

“Be careful not to play their game.”

The Da Vinci Code upset the Vatican and some Catholics because of its storyline, in which Jesus married Mary Magdalene and had children, creating a royal bloodline that Church officials kept secret for centuries.

Christians are taught that Jesus never married, was crucified and rose from the dead.

Despite the controversy, and a critical mauling at the Cannes film festival where it was launched, The Da Vinci Code went on to gross more than $750 million worldwide, supporting the theory that no publicity is bad publicity.

However, the Rome archdiocese did refuse Angels & Demons the right to shoot in historic churches, forcing the crew to recreate them in Los Angeles.

And in the United States, Bill Donahue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, accused Brown and Howard of “smearing the Catholic Church with fabulously bogus tales”.

Howard responded by saying that neither he nor his new movie were anti-Catholic.

“And let me be a little controversial: I believe Catholics, including most in the hierarchy of the Church, will enjoy the movie for what it is: an exciting mystery, set in the awe-inspiring beauty of Rome,” Howard wrote in a post on the The Huffington Post website."

The outbreak – coming more than 50 days after the last local case in the city of 20 million people – showed how the virus can still come back as restrictions are eased. The city's swift response reflected China's emphasis on moving quickly to stem the spread of new cases wherever they appear, a lesson learned from fighting the outbreak earlier.

""The epidemic was already almost over, and then suddenly there's one or two more new hot spots,"" said Jin Zheng, a woman in her 20s walking in central Beijing. ""I'm a little scared. I hope everyone avoids going outside too much and wears protective gear.""

Authorities locked down 11 residential communities near the Xinfadi market, about 3 kilometers (2 miles) southeast of the Temple of Heaven tourist site. Police officers could be seen maneuvering white fencing into place to seal off a road leading to a cluster of apartment buildings.

Communist Party members and volunteers were being mobilized to shop for food and other daily necessities for the affected residents, the Beijing News newspaper said in a social media post. It wasn't immediately clear how many people live in the 11 communities.

Outside the market, paramilitary police in green uniforms put up vehicle barricades and stood in position at the entrances. Some people were allowed in after showing documents at checkpoints. A red banner reading ""We cannot lower our guard when it comes to epidemic prevention and control"" hung on a fence.

Beijing officials said 45 workers at the market tested positive for the coronavirus, though they showed no symptoms. That was in addition to seven earlier cases of people with symptoms, including six who had visited or worked at the market. China does not include asymptomatic cases in its official case count.

Inspectors took 1,901 samples from meat, surfaces, dustbins, handles and other objects at the market, and 40 tested positive, the officials said.

The Beijing News, citing the head of the Xinfadi market, said the virus had been found on a chopping board for imported salmon. That led to several major supermarket chains removing salmon from their shelves, another newspaper, the Beijing Youth Daily, reported.

Attention focused on the market after the reports of the first three cases on Thursday and Friday. Two of the infected people had been to the market, and the third worked with one of them at a nearby meat research institute, according to Chinese media reports.

City officials then decided to test all the workers at the market for the coronavirus. They also ordered the testing of food and environmental samples from all the city's wholesale food markets, and food safety inspections at restaurants and supermarkets.

Beijing, which had gradually been returning to normal, reversed some recent moves to relax coronavirus restrictions.

Plans to reopen primary schools for grades one to three this Monday were shelved, and athletic events have been canceled. One immediate casualty was an orienteering race slated for Saturday, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

The National Center for the Performing Arts, which had just reopened on June 2, reclosed, according to The Paper, a Chinese media outlet.

Cao Yajiang, who works in finance, said it's hard to avoid a second outbreak but expressed confidence that authorities could control it.

""When I first saw it, I was really panicked, but when I calmed down and thought it over, I thought it wasn't a big deal, because they'll seal off the area,"" he said. ""There shouldn't be a large-scale outbreak."""

In a thinly veiled comment aimed at the incoming administration, Obama told NBC's Lester Holt that ""You have to be careful because anything you say can move markets or start wars.""

The outgoing president also discussed at length the various highs and lows of his presidency, naming the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as his lowest point in office.

""My worst day as president was hearing that 20 six-year-olds had been shot in the most brutal way,"" he said.

The president also spoke of the challenges of lifting up his party while in office.

""I had trouble transferring my personal popularity or support to the broader cause of the Democratic Party,"" he said. ""And I think that's a legitimate criticism.

Obama, the first African-American president, also elaborated on how his journey didn't spell the end of racial challenges facing the country.

""I think any talk of the post-racial America before my election was never realistic,"" he said. ""I think that talk was not only naive but it created some problems down the road.""

Obama, however, said he remained optimistic about the changes he made while in office, and that even though the country was seemingly moving in an opposing direction, ""his spirit was unchanged.""

""You get the baton and hopefully you've either advanced a lead or closed the gap when you pass the baton to the next person,"" he said."

China’s answer was flooding the zone: paying people to create content that supported the government and effectively drowned out any critics. It was soft censorship, less politically toxic and resource intensive than locking up any dissenter. Russia adopted a more bellicose stance, raising armies of trolls who would harass, defame, and humiliate Vladimir Putin’s critics, whether at home or abroad.

The tactics themselves were not always new. Russian attempts to defame opponents echoed World War I British “atrocity propaganda,” which attacked Germans with a mix of partially true and fabricated claims of deviance. Russia simply adapted that to the internet age.

It’s not hard to pick out how these tactics have spread to the United States. Trolling has been imported, both by Americans mirroring Russian tactics, and also by the very same Russian trolls—as alleged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his indictment of the “troll farm” Internet Research Agency and some of its employees and officers. There’s plenty of flooding the zone, too, from President Trump’s attention-sucking Twitter feed to the burgeoning market in fake news. The “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory emerged from the atrocity-propaganda tradition, and required internet trolls to spread. It combined a real restaurant with fake claims to slur Hillary Clinton and her aides.

“Somehow, most of them seem ridiculous, but over time these things have had a unfortunate tendency to stick,” Wu said.

The idea that the First Amendment should, and even can, adapt to a new moment like this is jarring—it feels like an everlasting edict. But as Wu pointed out, what Americans think of as the First Amendment tradition dates only to the mid-20th century. Seven years after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the government jailed a U.S. congressman under the Sedition Act because he had accused President John Adams of an “unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.”

Almost exactly 100 years ago, Eugene Debs gave a speech in Canton, Ohio, criticizing American engagement in World War I and the draft. He was charged, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison, with the punishment upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court. As late as the 1930s and ’40s, people were imprisoned for advocating communism. It was only after World War II that the current free-speech doctrines came into play.

That is both frightening and heartening. On the one hand, the shallow roots of today’s traditions show how easily the recent gains could be erased. Yet it also shows the First Amendment tradition can be flexible and adaptable to new moments. If Wu’s diagnoses are intriguing, however, his prescriptions are less satisfying."

Obama tweeted on Wednesday that he was proud to work with Trudeau and described him as a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues such as climate change.

""The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbours to the north support him for another term,"" Obama wrote.

Trudeau later responded with his own tweet: ""Thanks my friend, we're working hard to keep our progress going.""

Trudeau is in a tough re-election fight before Monday's parliamentary elections.

Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said that might have something to do with Obama's intervention.

""Trudeau is in real danger,"" Bothwell said. ""If I were a Liberal (Party) campaigner I would quietly point with pride to Obama's endorsement. I don't know if I'd run around touting it as a major political issue.""

Bothwell said you would have to go back more than 100 years to find a US president intervening in a Canadian federal election.

He said former US President Theodore Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, visited Toronto in 1917 when Canada was having an election about conscription and spoke in favour of it. But Bothwell said he did not know how explicit he was.

Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, called Obama's endorsement rare and said it possibly has not happened before but he does not think it will move the polls.

""In fact, some people may feel this is an unwarranted foreign intrusion in Canada's election,"" Wiseman said.

Obama also endorsed Emmanuel Macron for president in France's 2017 election, and he warned British voters against backing leaving the European Union.

Trudeau formed a close relationship with Obama when he was president and the two were pictured having dinner in Ottawa earlier this year.

The former president has long been popular with many Canadians. Trudeau's Liberal Party posted Obama's message into a party fundraising pitch that was emailed directly to potential donors

Trudeau's rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, said that he is ""not very interested what former foreign leaders are saying"". He said he would let Canadians judge whether Obama's endorsement is appropriate."

Alex's mother, Karen Echols, became outraged when the Dumb and Dumber actor shared a photo of her 14-year-old on Twitter on Tuesday while voicing his opposition to a new California law requiring vaccines for all schoolchildren.

Carrey also called California Gov. Jerry Brown a ""corporate fascist"" for signing the new bill into law.

But Echols, surprised over Carrey's tweets, called the actor's actions ""irresponsible,"" and said her son's autism was caused by a genetic disorder, not by vaccinations, which ""Alex safely received,"" she wrote.

After she demanded Carrey delete the photo, it was removed and Carey posted this message Thursday night:

Despite erroneously thrusting their son to the centre of the contentious anti-vax and pro-vax debate, Karen Echols accepted the actor's apology and asked him to use his voice for her cause instead.

Bullshit, James Ball tells me, can get you into the Oval Office.

The former Guardian journalist and now special correspondent at BuzzFeed is well versed in separating fact from fiction.As a young reporter fresh out of university he started as an intern at WikiLeaks, working on the verification and publication of confidential US documents in 2010, and then on the Snowden leaks in 2013 during his time at The Guardian.

That’s all to say he’s developed a sixth sense for what is, and isn’t, bullshit.

With this in mind, today Ball is publishing his debut book as a solo author on the fake news phenomenon which has engulfed the world of politics over the last year.

We sat down with Ball to find out how half-truths, untruths and outright fakery took over:

Fake news, post-truths and bullshit, is this a new phenomenon?

This definitely isn't new: newspapers have run questionable stories for as long as they've existed, and fake news has circulated the web for just as long.

But things have changed a bit – fake news got political last year, because that was the way to get huge audiences.

So it's some old trends that have suddenly really come to the fore.



So who's to blame for fake news?

Russia! More seriously – all of us.

Fake news is just the most visible bit of what is a whole ecosystem of half-truths, untruths and outright fakery, or in other words, of bullshit.

When we share a story without thinking about it or checking, we're part of that system. When a hyper-partisan news site (think Breitbart or The Canary) over-hypes and spins a kernel of truth into something much bigger, that's part of it.

When mainstream outlets run too-good-to-check stories, they're part of it. And when Facebook and others profit off this whole system, they're part of it too.

Are there examples of fake news causing real harm?

The Pizzagate conspiracy – an alt-right theory that pizza parlours were harbouring secret child abuse sites used by leading democrats – led to an armed man storming a DC pizza parlour.

So the consequences of this stuff can be very real.

Polling shows Republicans believe Obama wiretapped Trump (there's no evidence he did), while many Democrats believe US election machines themselves were hacked (there's no evidence of this either).

When we all believe different facts, we can't have a public conversation – we can only have a shouting match.

So what's the solution? Will we ever be free of fake news?

The upside of all of us being part of the problem is that we can all be part of the solution.

We need to find ways to make corrections reach as many people as the initial bad reports and hoaxes do. We've got to find new ways to cover politicians and campaigns which deploy bullshit to win. There's no one big fix, but there's lots of little things all of us can do.

The fightback can start whenever we like.

In Germany, the period of the ‘30s and first half of the ‘40s, was the first time electronic mass communication was used to propagandize the masses for control.

The evil Nazi genius, Joseph Goebbels, is arguably the leading modern propagandist.

His basic propaganda to defeat the Communist Party was to present it as being evil and the Nazi Party as righteous without using any real rationale, logic or facts.

His theory: “If you repeat a lie often enough people will believe it and you will even come to believe it yourself.”

He also said, “The bigger the lie the more it will be believed,” and, “There is no need for propaganda to be rich in intellectual content.”

Americans watching cable news networks seem to see this type of propaganda in play every day. Does this system work? Yes.

Goebbels was able to talk a Christian nation into justifying the murder of millions of people.

During the night of the long knives and shortly thereafter when Hitler had Ernst Rohm (head of the SA – or Storm Battallion) murdered, Goebbels propaganda machine exposed his evil homosexual lifestyle which they had known about for years and had kept it covered up because he previously benefited them.

It sounds like what happens frequently today when politicians and notables suddenly are exposed or fall from grace yet many people knew about their socially unacceptable, immoral or illegal activities for years."
