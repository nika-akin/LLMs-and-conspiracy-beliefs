Are vaccines really as “safe and effective” as the manufacturers and CDC always claim? Obviously not. Currently there are no epidemic- or pandemic-style breakouts of infectious diseases, yet half of all Americans are against vaccines and either haven’t received any lately or simply never have or will.

Instead, we see over 100 million people building and maintaining immunity to bacteria and viruses using organic food, natural medicine and natural remedies. Too many vaccine studies and researchers have shown that vaccines are not linked to lower disease rates, but rather to chronic illnesses and central nervous system disorders.

The Danish Study, based entirely on fake research, tried to sever the link between autism and vaccines forever. Too make a long story short, a criminal psychiatrist, Dr. Poul Thorsen, was entrenched in pro-vaccine propaganda with the CDC. His job was to use fraudulent data to dismiss the dangers of using mercury in vaccines. Too many people were figuring out that it cripples the nervous system of young children during their first years of life (it’s now known as autism spectrum disorder).

Thorsen embezzled over $2 million by falsifying information on grants that were taxpayer funded. This schmuck literally authored the Danish Study and the CDC said it was the final proof that autism and vaccines have no link. That’s where the saying “the science is settled” comes from. They had to snuff the truth before too many people caught on that vaccines are bogus. Just one huge reason not to put your faith in vaccines or your body on the experimental chopping block.

Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.

Remember the top Merck scientists who blew the whistle on the spiked blood samples of the falsified mumps vaccine?

Two Merck scientists, back in 2010, filed a False Claims Act (that became unsealed later), stating outright that top vaccine manufacturer Merck FALSIFIED test data by spiking blood samples with animal antibodies so they could sell the CDC on a lie – that the mumps vaccine was “95% effective.” That’s how Merck sells hundreds of millions of dollars worth of vaccines to the CDC and America, you see. They lie about the research, then the mass media fabricates a measles outbreak and voila! Still wonder why 50 percent of Americans avoid vaccines? Wait, there’s more.

Here’s an excerpt from the report:

Merck also added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, though it knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that “did not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life … virus neutralization in vaccinated people,” according to the complaint.

Heard enough? It gets worse. After the U.S. government knew about the False Claims Act and the horrid acts of top Merck virologists, they ignored it all. It was all about protecting the vaccine industry in general and FDA regulators were “in bed” with Merck. Talk about industry monopolies. And that, my friends, brings us to the Pharma Phive.

The Pharma 5 want complete control over your immune system

The top 5 vaccine companies by revenue include Merck, Sanofi, GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), Pfizer, and Novartis. Thanks to forced vaccination campaigns in California and New York, falsified research, and emotionally-charged media propaganda, the vaccine market in general continues to grow (think $30 billion here). If you’re wondering which vaccines are doing the most chronic damage that brings in all this revenue, look no further than the dreaded flu shot, a.k.a. the “influenza vaccine.”

Soon, the fraudulent vaccine industry Pharma Phive will release fake cures and fake prevention vaccines for HIV and cancer. They will falsify research and skew statistics to brainwash the public, about 100 million sheeple, to get jabbed with immune-system-damaging neurotoxins and genetically modified and mutated animal cells and human abortion cells.

The vaccine industry must con Americans into “acceptance” of adult vaccines. They admit that themselves, but the vaccinated have no idea what they’re saying, because the mercury “dumbs down” the masses. In fact, the vaccinated are so brainwashed, that even when the CDC admits on television and in the newspapers that they guessed the “wrong strains” of the flu for the season, people STILL get the shot, as advised, under the guise of “better safe than sorry.” Well, after you get the shot, get ready to be sorry. The flu vaccine is proven to lower immunity to the flu the following year and cause worse cases of it to boot. Oops.

Tune in to Vaccines.news to find out why 50 percent of America knows better than to get genetically modified viral strains and cancer cells injected into their muscle tissue, over and over. Remember this: All the hysteria surrounding disease “outbreaks” you hear about on television and see plastered across social media is all about selling more vaccines. It’s always only been about the money."

Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?

Trump’s tweet comes just days after Nancy Pelosi insisted Friday that Congress’ next economic package would provide billions for financially reeling state and local governments, foreshadowing a sharp partisan fight ahead in lawmakers’ continuing response to the coronavirus pandemic.

“There will not be a bill without state and local” aid, Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters in the Capitol. Suggesting that Democrats have leverage to address a problem that shows no signs of vanishing soon, she also said, “There will be a bill, and it will be expensive.”

While Pelosi cited no price tag, she said it could be roughly what Congress has already provided for small businesses in previous legislation, which has exceeded $500 billion. Pelosi has begun framing the battle in political terms. She has said House Democrats will include the money in legislation they will call the “Heroes Act” because it will include funds to pay the salaries of police, firefighters, transit workers, health workers in public hospitals and others battling the virus.

With a salmon-colored scarf lowered from covering her face, Pelosi told reporters at a news conference that it would be “morally wrong” to not help those workers. “We can’t defeat this pandemic if Mitch McConnell is letting our health heroes get fired, and that’s what’s happening,” she said.

That was just one of several remarks she made criticizing McConnell by name, something congressional leaders often avoid doing to one another. “Speaking of Mitch, what’s gotten into him?” she said, citing his support for letting states declare bankruptcy.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other congressional Democrats are also demanding more aid for state and local governments.

Pelosi’s remarks put her in direct conflict with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who as we noted last week, expressed opposition to providing more local help. Indeed, in last week’s follow-up bailout bill that Trump signed Friday providing roughly $480 billion more for small businesses and hospitals, Republicans blocked all of the additional $150 billion that Democrats wanted for state and local governments.

McConnell has expressed strong opposition to providing more money for those governments. On Fox News this week, he cited concerns about the mushrooming national debt and opposition to helping states resolve pension and other problems.

“We’re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to let them solve problems they created for themselves,” McConnell said.

But what sparked broad democrat outrage, was McConnell’s suggestion that states be allowed to declare bankruptcy, which is not currently permitted. His suggestion drew ire from members of both parties because it would jeopardize popular state services and cause their future borrowing costs to soar. Retiring Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., tweeted this week that McConnell’s suggestion “makes McConnell the Marie Antoinette of the Senate.”

Until today, President Donald Trump has been a wild card, making comments that have wavered between support and skepticism – especially with some GOP senators and governors calling for more aid for state and local governments. Last Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that “we’re always going to help states,” but added, “The states that seem to have the problem happen to be Democrat.” He added that New York and New Jersey “were in a lot of trouble long before the plague came.”

In light of his latest tweet, we now know where the president stands on this debate… at least for the time being.

America’s politicians are scrambling to see who can keep their constituents cooped up inside their homes the longest due to fears about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). And some of them are now saying that in order to be let out, the human cattle will have to be compliant in getting vaccinated.

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, one of the architects of Obamacare (Affordable Care Act) and a special adviser to the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), recently told MSNBC‘s The Last Word that there will be no returning back to normal for Americans unless they agree to get jabbed with a vaccine that won’t even be available for at least another year.

The brother to former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Ezekiel, or “Zeke,” as some people call him, stated that “no one is immune to the COVID-19 virus,” adding that “it threatens us all.” Consequently, the only way to keep everyone “safe” and “protected” is to inject them with a chemical cocktail that may not be ready for another 18 months.

What this means is that Americans could be forced to remain in quarantine until the fall of 2021 because “we will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications.” In other words, get jabbed and be set free, or refuse to get jabbed and remain locked down in your home potentially forever.

“I know that’s dreadful news to hear,” Zeke stated. “How are people supposed to find work if this goes on in some form for a year and a half? Is all that economic pain worth trying to stop COVID-19? The truth is we have no choice.”

Be sure to check out the following segment of The Health Ranger Report with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, in which he discusses how there’s really no such thing as “panic buying,” but rather preparedness buying:

“We cannot return to normal until there’s a vaccine” – are you going to allow this, America?

While earlier on stating that we need to find a vaccine “or effective medications” in order to let the herd out of the pen, Zeke later stated unequivocally that there won’t be any returning to normal “until there’s a vaccine,” period. That’s because globalists like eugenicist Bill Gates are insistent upon making sure that everyone is jabbed before allowing any semblance of freedom to be reinstated.

How unelected bureaucrats like Ezekiel Emanuel and technocrats like Bill Gates rose to this high level of power and influence while Americans sat back and did nothing is truly mind-boggling. But this is where we now are as a society, which tolerates being locked down indefinitely at the order of tyrants who openly admit that their plan is to dangle a future vaccine as the key to being let out of house arrest prison.

“Conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure,” Zeke went on to declare, as if he somehow holds the rightful authority to make such a draconian decision.

You’re probably thinking, but will there even be a country to return to in 12-18 months if society remains under forced lock and key? That’s a really good question, and the answer is probably not, save for endless fiat injections and debt accumulation that in and of itself will destroy the country, assuming that keeping everyone under house arrest doesn’t accomplish this first.

As Zeke’s brother once stated, don’t let a good crisis go to waste. And when it comes to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), tyrants in government certainly aren’t letting that happen.

A global pandemic is not enough for leftists to throw politics aside

President Donald Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, posted a series of endearing photos of her family spending time indoors as public officials urged people to quarantine amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Staying home today w/ kids? Plan living room camp out!” Ivanka wrote sharing a photo from 2014 of her children.

“Throw a bedsheet over some taped together brooms. Plan a menu & ‘pack’ sandwiches, salads (S’mores optional),” she said.

“A fun activity that also brings the family together for a meal! Share your ideas & use the hashtag #TogetherApart.”

But as many Democrats and leftists alike have shown, a global pandemic is not enough for them to throw politics aside and band together.

For example, far-left Hollywood celebrity and Democratic Party operative Chrissy Teigen launched a vile, unprovoked, expletive-filled attack against First Lady Melania Trump on social media.

“f*** im so drunk from the streams and I have a Skype therapy session in 20 mins.”

""Has Melania even thought about doing something with her be best sh*t during these times?"" Teigen asked.

Meanwhile, Hollywood liberal celebrities campaigned for President Donald Trump to resign, causing more discourse in a time that needs anything but division.

So it seems Trump's light-hearted attempt at uniting people was in vain amid the pandemic that failed to reach the heart of liberals.

And the leftist Twitter mob revealed their true colors.

Democrats on social media routinely display a total separation from common decency as they quarantine themselves against morality in the safe spaces of their liberal echo chambers.

Even during a national emergency, a sweet family photo with an invitation for unity is used by them as a means to hammer their opposition.

A classified CIA memo discussing the United States as a possible “exporter of terrorism” because of al-Qaeda recruitment in America has been posted on website, Wikileaks.

The three-page document addressed the hypothetical question of the impact on the United States if Americans were found to be operating abroad to carry out acts of terrorism.

The CIA memo, produced by the agency’s Red Cell ‘think tank’ set up after the September 11 attacks, does not appear to expose any state secrets and was dismissed by one government official as hardly a “blockbuster.”

It is the latest classified memo to be published by the whistle-blowing website, which last month released more than 70,000 secret military documents on the allied war in Afghanistan, prompting an FBI investigation.

It has threatened to release some 15,000 more, despite criticism that the leaks endangered the lives of sources and exposed sensitive intelligence gathering methods to enemy fighters.

The latest memo said the United States could lose leverage over allies to co-operate on terrorism, particularly on “extra-judicial activities”.

“Primarily we have been concerned about al Qaeda infiltrating operatives into the United States to conduct terrorist attacks, but AQ may be increasingly looking for Americans to operate overseas,” the document proposes.

“Undoubtedly al Qaeda and other terrorist groups recognise that Americans can be great assets in terrorist operations overseas.”

It said US citizens are valuable to terrorist organisations because they are harder to detect. They don’t fit the typical Arab-Muslim profile and can easily communicate with leaders through their “unfettered” access to the internet and other methods, the report said.

The report cited cases of Americans involved in alleged plots in Pakistan, India and elsewhere and said “contrary to common belief, the American export of terrorism or terrorists is not a recent phenomenon.”

The CIA played down the paper’s significance, noting Red Cell teams of analysts were tasked with taking up hypothetical scenarios and presenting alternate views, divergent from mainstream thinking.

“These sorts of analytic products – clearly identified as coming from the Agency’s ‘Red Cell’ – are designed simply to provoke thought and present different points of view,” said spokesman George Little.

It said the United States had a certain amount of leverage with allies on extradition requests following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but warned that could change.

“If the US were seen as an ‘exporter of terrorism,’ foreign governments could request a reciprocal arrangement that would impact US sovereignty,” it said.

It said foreign governments could request information on U.S. citizens or request their “rendition,” or the secret, extra-judicial transfer of a terrorism suspect abroad.

“U.S. refusal to co-operate with foreign government requests for extradition might lead some governments to consider secretly extracting U.S. citizens,” the report said.

It also warned of potential obstruction of U.S. efforts and cited an Italian case against CIA agents, who were convicted last year of kidnapping a terrorism suspect in Milan and flying him to Egypt, where he says he was tortured during questioning.

“The proliferation of such cases would not only challenge US bilateral relations with other countries but also damage global counterterrorism efforts,” it said.

“’A fireman need not obtain the informed consent of the owner before extinguishing a house fire. Vaccination is known to extinguish the fire of contagion,’ Judge Lawrence Knipel wrote in his decision, calling the mandatory vaccination order ‘a rare but necessary step’ and dismissing the parents’ arguments that it violates their religious freedom, medical ethics, and ‘internationally accepted human rights principles such as the Nuremberg Code.’”1

The emergency order is still in place and still mandates that anyone over the age of six months who lives, works, or attends school in several Brooklyn zip codes, must be vaccinated. (This area is home to large concentrations of Orthodox Jews. Why isn’t this a hate crime?)

Peer reviewed studies on nearly 1000 whales from around the globe showed ""jaw dropping"" levels of aluminum had been absorbed in their bodies. New studies now also show the same results for the collapsing bee populations around the globe. In fact, all invertebrates are in sharp decline. What about human exposure? The results are the same. Those in power have already committed the greatest and most deadly crime in the history of the human race, and that crime is ongoing. The criminal cabals that masquerade as governments are not about to stop, in fact, they are doubling down and further ramping up the deadly atmospheric spraying. There is virtually no place to hide from the lethal fallout and the deadly effects are erupting throughout the web of life. In the 4 minute video below the global heavy metal contamination and the health implications are discussed on the ""Buzzsaw"" TV show with Sean Stone, son of film director Oliver Stone.

Many believe that our ""elected officials"" would do something about the situation if they only knew, but is this reality? Sadly, our government and all those in it are completely bought and paid for by the power structure, I know this first hand after twelve years in this battle. I have been in senator Barbara Boxer's office presenting hard science data on geoneingineering, I have had high level meetings with California EPA officials, spoken in front of the entire California Air Resources Board, presented in front of the California Energy Commission, and had a private meeting with the lieutenant governor of California, Gavin Newsom and his top aid at the State Capital, etc, all were complete dead ends no matter how much credible science data they were presented with. In the next 4 minute video below, I publicly confronted US congressman Doug LaMalfa with water testing data from Cal. EPA which proved aluminum was flowing through California rivers and streams.

What did congressman LaMalfa and his staff do with the data presented from California EPA? Their final response was this, they did not recognize the EPA information as being valid. LaMalfa, along with all those already mentioned, continue to completely stonewall the critical climate engineering issue. This is what they are all paid to do. Can we be absolutely sure that aerosol spraying is occurring in our skies? We have indisputable film footage to prove it as is shown in the 2 minute video below.

The decimation and mortality already caused by over six decades of geoengineering is already so immense, it is far beyond any possible quantification, if these programs continue, the consequences to life on Earth will soon be total. The burden of exposing the climate engineering insanity lies on us, the people. Disclosure will NEVER come from those who are paid or otherwise pressured to lie. We must all prioritize the battle to expose and halt climate engineering as if our lives depend on it, because they do.

The Ministry's three slogans - ""War is Peace,"" ""Freedom is Slavery"" and ""Ignorance is Strength"" - revealed its talent for reversing the meaning of words. In high school, I assumed that this type of manipulation would never work in the real world, but now and again I wonder - especially when I hear President Bush attempt to reshape our perception of actual events by telling us that the truth is the opposite of what we're seeing. During the State of the Union address this week, he said, ""We seek the end of tyranny in our world."" Yet, his administration has engaged in extremely tyrannical behavior: invading a sovereign nation, incarcerating people without trials, committing torture, spying on its own citizens and shrouding itself in secrecy. Regarding the war in Iraq, he said, ""If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores."" Though it has long been proved that the Sept. 11 terrorists weren't from Iraq, had no connection to Iraq, and are not now in Iraq, President Bush continues to insist that the war is related to Sept. 11. He said, ""There is no peace in retreat. And there is no honor in retreat."" Of course, there can be peace and honor in retreat, but since he practices a doctrine of never considering alternatives and never admitting mistakes, denigrating the merits of retreat is like a scorched-Earth policy that forces combatants forward even if it's suicidal to continue. He said, ""We are on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory."" Because of the challenges related to fighting a shadow army of insurgents, the coalition has been on the defensive for most of the war. The only thing that has been clear from the start is that the Bush administration never has had a well-developed plan. About the war, President Bush said, ""We are winning."" More than 2,200 U.S. troops have been killed, more than 16,500 have been injured, and combat operations have cost hundreds of billions of dollars with no end in sight. The statement ""We are winning"" is pure puffery. ""Our coalition has learned from experience in Iraq,"" he said. President Bush loves to suggest that he has learned things, but he never reveals what he has learned and, when pressed, he always insists that he wouldn't change any of his previous choices. True to form, he followed up his comment about learning with, ""Hindsight alone is not wisdom. Second-guessing is not a strategy."" This is clever speechwriting, but it's simply not true. If a drunk driver received a DWI citation or, worse, caused an accident, the courts would use hindsight and second-guessing to punish him and to instill greater wisdom in his future choices. President Bush said, ""However we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option."" Again, he suggests that he has learned something, but then insists that the only possible choice is to continue doing what he's been doing from the start. Whether it's deliberate or accidental, President Bush is channeling the Ministry of Truth in making these statements that are intended to manipulate the American people into believing the words coming out of his mouth more than the evidence they can see with their own eyes. His poll numbers continue to drop, so it seems that Americans, unlike the citizens in Orwell's book, are able to see through his lies.

Chancellor rejects calls to block visitors from Italy travelling to Germany

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is refusing to close Germany's border to visitors from Italy, despite warning this week that her government predicts up to 58 million Germans could contract coronavirus.

Merkel is rejecting mounting calls to block visitors from the worst affected countries as the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to spiral out of control.

The chancellor said she refused to close the border during a joint press conference held with Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn in Berlin.

During Merkel's first public address on the outbreak, the German leader warned that border closures would not be enough to stop the spread of the virus, according to Hungarian newspaper Mandiner.

""This is a test for our solidarity, our common sense and care for each other. And I hope we pass the test,"" she said.

However, she ruled out following Austria's lead in banning visitors from Italy, despite warning that up to 70 percent of Germany could become infected with the coronavirus.

Her refusal to put in ban visitors from one of the worst-hit countries in the world follows comments she made just two days ago that she wanted to implement measures to ""buy time"" in the fight against coronavirus.

Merkel said ""all measures"" being put in place are to slow the spread of the virus.

She said such measures could help give researchers time to conduct medical research and even create a vaccine, which would be important for next winter when the virus is expected to accelerate.

Despite Merkel's claims of ""solidarity"" and to ""care for each other"" as the reason for maintaining an open border policy with Italy, other actions from her government seem to contradict her.

Germany recently moved to block medical supplies to Italy, an action condemned by other EU members.

Italy has 12,500 coronavirus cases and 826 deaths, and the country serves as the epicenter of coronavirus in Europe.

Italy has banned travelers from a number of nations, including China and Iran in addition to implementing a nation-wide quarantine.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump implemented a total travel ban for travelers entering the U.S. from Europe, except for the United Kingdom.

The move comes after the United States became one of the first countries to ban travelers from China.

During an address to the nation, President Trump said that if Europe had blocked travelers from China earlier, it may have avoided or at least slowed the transmission of coronavirus.

Current data shows that Germany, with 1,966 confirmed cases of coronavirus and three deaths, was the world's seventh most affected country by the coronavirus outbreak.

Earlier this week, the COVID-19 outbreak declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Merkel also said she was open to scrapping Germany's ""black zero"" rule to allow new government borrowing.

She said it was ""an extraordinary situation"" and that ending the outbreak came first.

""The virus is in Germany, it is in Europe. That’s the thought we have to get used to,"" Spahn said.

""It will still spread even if you close all the borders.

""Sooner or later you have to let people in or out and then it starts spreading again.""

Experts estimate the virus’s mortality rate in an advanced healthcare system like Germany’s at between 0.1% and 0.7%, Spahn added.

Though Germany has the most intensive care beds per capita in Europe, its healthcare system could quickly be overwhelmed if the virus spread too fast.

Interviewed on Deutschlandfunk radio, Spahn said Germany’s current priority was to slow the virus’s spread to minimize the peak burden on the country’s health system."

The singer remarks come following the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer.

Liberal Grammy and Oscar-winning singer John Legend blasted President Donald Trump saying he “needs to be removed from office"" before calling him a “cancer.""

The singer remarks come following the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer.

The official resigned following his handling of the case regarding Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher.

“The President is a cancer and needs to be removed from office as soon as possible,” John Legend said on Twitter in response to Spencer’s letter on his departure.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper lost “trust and confidence” after learning the Navy secretary had contradicted his public position by privately proposing that Trump allow the Navy to conduct an internal review of Gallagher.

The decision came just a day after Spencer denied reports that he had threatened to resign after Trump intervened in Gallagher’s case.

Gallagher was acquitted of war crimes charges including shooting civilians, murdering a teenage Islamic State captive, and threatening those who gave their superiors information on him during his time in Iraq.

He was also convicted of posing for a photo with the IS fighter’s dead body.

Gallagher was sentenced to four months confinement and loss of rank.

President Trump restored Gallagher’s rank to E-7 and tweeted that the Navy would not remove his Trident pin.

Last year, Legend slammed Trump saying, ""the president is a f***ing embarrassment,"" following CNN's Jim Acosta's heated exchanged during a White House press conference.

Legend refrained from going into specific detail on why he thinks the President is embarrassing, but the indicator was the timing of the Tweet, which was sent just 20 minutes after Acosta's outrageous spectacle at the press conference.

The confrontational exchange occurred while the President was giving a press conference on the results of the midterm election.

For years, dozens of South Korean middle school girls, and sometimes boys, were filmed performing violent sexual acts and self-harm. The videos were then shared through Telegram chat rooms in exchange for payments made in cryptocurrency.

The Korean police found dozens of victims since the videos often displayed girls’ names and addresses.

After more than 5 million Koreans signed petitions to name the man who led the group that blackmailed girls and created the Telegram groups, the police decided to reveal his identity. The name of the 24 year old criminal is Cho Ju-bin.

The police also revealed that over 10,000 people used the Telegram chatrooms, with some paying over $1,200 in crypto for gaining access. So far, the police know about 74 people, including 16 minor girls, who had been exploited.

Elsewhere, reporters of local media agency Kookmin Ilbo discovered about 25,000 users across 30 such Telegram chat rooms.

Other estimates from local media claim that there were up to 300,000 paying customers using similar chat rooms.

He is charged with abuse, threats and coercion, and violating the sexual abuse act, the child protection act, and the privacy act.

Although the police haven’t confirmed it yet, there are reports that a local crypto exchange traced the crypto transactions and found out that some of the fee-paying members were popular artists, professors, sports celebrities, and startup founders and company CEOs.

The child porn suspect is a 24 year old man nicknamed “baksa,” which translates as “doctor” or “guru.” He managed the Telegram chat rooms where videos of child abuse were shared in exchange for payments. Cho charged the viewers in crypto, which made it difficult for the police to trace and shut down the chat rooms. However, given that South Korean law requires all crypto exchange clients to pass through KYC/AML verification procedures, the platform could help authorities find members and understand the magnitude of the incident.

So far, the police have tracked down 124 individuals related to the case. Cho and 17 others have been detained."

The hidden agenda behind chemtrails and other geoengineering programs

What do record snowfalls in Japan; severe droughts in Texas and violent tornadoes have in common? Well, did you know that these extreme weather conditions are sold as derivatives on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange? Imagine the value of knowing (in advance) that a severe storm was eminent and you could bet on it for profit. Do you think there is incentive to control the weather without regard for human life? (It’s all true – look it up yourself)

Now, let’s take a look at how the military is using weather control techniques as a weapon in warfare. Back in 1967, the United States military ran “Operation Popeye” – a “cloud seeding” program during the Vietnam War which extended the monsoon season over Laos. The rainfall was so heavy over 30 – 45 days that truck traffic was impaired – giving the U.S. military an advantage over the enemy.

There is no denying that our current weather patterns have become more extreme and (often times) deadly. But, here’s the real shocking news, government agencies have been secretly manipulating the weather for decades and, worse yet, without our permission. State run propaganda machines would have us believe that toxic chemicals sprayed into the atmosphere are designed to save us from global warming. But, the truth is, chemtrails actually cause global warming by preventing the earth from naturally cooling itself – at night.

If you have any doubt about the dangers of chemtrails – I suggest you watch the movie, “What in the World are They Spraying” by Michael Murphy. In this film, you will discover many of the toxic substances being sprayed into our atmosphere, such as, Arsenic, aerosol, aluminum, barium, depleted uranium, high levels of mercury plus many other toxic substances. It’s no wonder that allergies, asthma and even cancer rates have soared due to the mass poisoning of our population without our consent.

On the next NaturalNews Talk Hour – we’ll talk about “Why in the World They are Spraying” with filmmaker Michael Murphy – an expert in chemtrail research.

Michael J. Murphy is a filmmaker, political activist and President of The Coalition Against Geo-engineering. His work focuses on issues that go beyond the interest of the Corporate mainstream media and includes originating and Co-Producing the groundbreaking documentary, “What in the World are They Spraying?” and several other short films that address controversial political issues.

On Wednesday Wired magazine published an article entitled ‘Amazon sells ‘autism cure’ books that suggest children drink toxic, bleach-like substances they cover an investigation they have done on Amazon into the ease of which anyone can upload a Kindle book sale offers its readers potentially dangerous methods for curing autism. The article then goes on to point out some books on the platform that in their minds are dangerous books offering solutions to Autism which have no scientific backing.

Now the main focus of the article is on books promoting that Autism sufferers should drink a bleach-like substance, however, it does also point out books like Fight Autism and Win which promotes the practice of chelation, which draws heavy metals out of the subject’s body.

Wired magazine quickly points out that a child died following an intravenous chelation session.

However, what the article failed to point out, is that this book specifically educates people not to do intravenous chelation as its highly dangerous. The book offers a more subtle, gentle approach to the chelation and also goes into dietary changes which can help the healing process.

The rest of the media, of course, jumped on the bandwagon and mirrored the article without any further research into the subject, this was shortly followed by Amazon removing the two books highlighted in the Wired article.

Where Does it End?

Here lies the problem, if the media can drum up enough attention on a particular book that they feel is misleading, misinformation, entirely false or even dangerous to get it banned from the Worlds Book selling monopoly that is Amazon, then our literature has been hijacked.

What will be next, Alternative Cancer Cures?

We can’t comment on the two books that have been banned from sale on Amazon as we haven’t read them, however from what we understand about ‘Fight Autism and Win’ at least is that the very reason it got highlighted and later banned is because of the practice the writers make pretty clear should never be attempted.

Dan Crenshaw.

Rep. Crenshaw appeared on an episode of Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, published Tuesday, and discussed his views on U.S. foreign policy in the middle east.

The Young Turks employee Hasan Piker, who is the nephew of Cenk Uygur - founder of the progressive commentary program -, reacted angrily while watching an internet live stream of the episode and praised the “brave f*cking soldier” who injured Crenshaw, who lost an eye while serving his country.

“This guy has the understanding of foreign policy of, like, a 12-year-old,” Piker said while watching Crenshaw’s appearance with Rogan.

""What the f-ck. What the f-ck is wrong with this dude?""

""Didn’t he go to war and like literally lose his eye because some mujahideen — a brave f-cking soldier — f-cked his eye hole with their d-ck?”

Piker added, “Isn’t that how he f-cking lost his dumbass eye, because he got his f-cking eye hole f-cked, by a brave soldier?”

Accoridng to the Daily Caller, Crenshaw, a former Navy Seal, served three tours in Iraq and lost his right eye from an IED explosion.

The progressive host didn’t stop there, Piker continued saying, “America deserved 9/11, dude. Fuck it I’m saying it.”

Accoridng to the Washington Times, the remark spurred an uproar on Twitter, and Mr. Piker responded by tweeting a longer clip of his rant, apparently to provide more context, in which he argued that America funded the perpetrators who carried out 9/11.

“Like, we f–ing totally brought it on ourselves, dude, holy s–,” he said in the video.

“Look at the way that this dips—t is running his f–ing mouth, justifying genocide right now.

""How is anything I’m saying controversial? We f–ing fund the people who did 9/11 still to this day.”

Piker also defended himself on Twitter, writing, “americas foreign policy decisions has lead to 911. this would’ve been a controversial thing to say in 2001. stop being a f**king idiot.”

A second tweet added, “we supplied arms to and trained bin laden. we destabilized the region long before 911. and now we’re stuck in perpetual war, which dan crenshaw was trying to justify in that clip. it’s exactly this kind of attitude that has sent thousands of young men and women overseas to die.”

The congressman, a former Navy Seal, served five tours of duty and lost his right eye from an IED explosion in Afghanistan.

“This guy has the understanding of foreign policy of, like, a 12-year-old,” Mr. Piker said in the video.

“Didn’t he go to war and, like, literally lose his eye because some mujahideen — a brave f–ing soldier — f–ed his eye hole with their [expletive]?”

Mr. Piker also attacked Mr. Crenshaw on Twitter, saying “right wing victim hood is a brain disease.”

That July, McNenly sighted a pattern he called a “sheet music grid” involving five parallel plumes running just above the northern horizon. It did not dissipate like a normal contrail.

The United States government has very long and storied history of perform both short and long-term experiments on sections of our population without their knowledge or consent. With that in mind, is the idea of chemtrails so far-fetched?

I live here in America’s oldest city of Saint Augustine, in the perpetually-sunny state of Florida. Multiple times per week, for the past 9 years, I have watched with amused fascination as airplanes fly in a weaving pattern, criss-crossing each other while their planes emit a dense, white trail. This trail, from here on referred to as a chemtrail, is not the same as the normal contrail that is produced when planes fly. A ‘condensed vapor trail’, or contrail, is thinner and dissipates within seconds after the plane has passed. The ‘chemical trail’, or chemtrail, is thicker and grows larger after it is produced, the exact opposite of the contrail. One of my Bible teachers used to tell me that ‘things that are different are not the same’. The photo your see at the top of this article I took myself, as well as the video at the bottom of the page.

I went and googled ‘chemtrails’, and was rather shocked at what results were returned to me. A few years ago, a Google search for ‘chemtrails’ would have returned a healthy pro-versus-con selection, leaving the reader to investigate and make up their own mind.Not so in 2019. The Google results I got today, I went through 15 pages of them, you can see for yourself here, all informed me that if I believed that chemtrails were real, then I was a ‘crazy conspiracy nut‘ and not to be taken seriously. Oh really? So that got me thinking about other ‘conspiracy theories’ where the powers that be called people nuts for believing but later turned out to be true. Here is just a few of those:

THE TUSKEGEE FORCED SYPHILIS EXPERIMENT: United States government doctors let 622 men believe they were getting free healthcare and treatment — but actually gave them no treatment at all. Instead, the purpose of the Tuskegee experiment (a.k.a. the Tuskegee syphilis study) was to observe untreated black patients as syphilis ravaged their bodies. The researchers thus observed the men who had syphilis until they died, lying to them about their condition to keep them from getting treatment anywhere else. They watched as their bodies slowly degraded and they died in agony. The government denied this for decades until it finally came to light over 40 years after the experiments had ended.

The longer President Donald Trump remains in office, the more unhinged and unsettled the perpetually angry Left becomes.

Trump Derangement Syndrome has gotten so bad for liberal billionaire Tom Steyer he is actually pining for a nuclear war that would kill tens of millions (including him) so there would be a “real course correction” for our country.

That’s absolutely insane. There were many on the right who were certainly not fans of Barack Obama, but as far as we know no conservative ever called for a nuclear war just so we could get rid of him.

As reported by the Washington Free Beacon, Steyer made his statement in the equally loony Rolling Stone magazine:

Steyer, who launched a national impeachment campaign against President Donald Trump last year, spoke with the liberal magazine about his efforts, which have been opposed by leading Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.).

Interviewer Tim Dickinson pointed out Pelosi’s strategy of opposing impeachment of President George W. Bush, to take the issue off the table in 2006. Democrats took back both chambers of Congress in an electoral rout that year.

Steyer said that he remembers 2006 and that Bush was responsible for embroiling America in “two disastrous wars” — which weren’t really “disastrous” except to the Left, and one of which was tied to our country being attacked on Sept. 11, 2001 (which Steyer probably blames America for).

He also said the U.S. was headed toward financial doom — what would become the Great Recession, though that really didn’t start until late 2007/early 2008.

“So if the answer is that we need those three things to happen for a course correction, I’d prefer to move a little quicker. How about that? But I take your point. Maybe we can have, like, a nuclear war and then we get a real course correction.”

He took it back, but…

After being questioned about the remark, Steyer said he would withdraw the nuclear war reference, but it’s obviously how he feels because it just rolled out of his mouth so effortlessly.

He then went on to preen and posture like the Left always does about how they are trying to ‘do the right thing,’ as though liberals are the true arbiters of national conscience and morality.

But it’s clear that Trump Derangement Syndrome has infected Steyers’ soul, judgment, and reasoning ability. Or he would have never made the ‘nuclear war’ reference to begin with.

And weren’t these same unhinged libs just recently claiming that Trump should get nothing less than full nuclear disarmament from North Korea? That was, of course, well after they were claiming — like they did with Ronald Reagan — that Trump would ‘get us into a nuclear war’ because, you know, he’s this bumbling idiot authoritarian who is really operating under Vladimir Putin’s command.

Or something like that.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this month, Steyer has spent $40 million in his bid to have Trump impeached. That’s odd, given the current makeup of the House; Republicans — the president’s party — control the chamber, and though there are some #NeverTrump RINOs among them, there aren’t nearly enough to back an impeachment. (Related: OUTRAGE: Washed up lib law prof Lawrence Tribe uses ‘shoot to kill’ metaphor discussing Trump impeachment.)

Besides, Trump hasn’t done anything to warrant impeachment. Obama, by comparison, so regularly ruled by executive fiat and was the master of ceremonies for so many scandals he proved that short of knocking off a convenience store and having the whole thing caught on camera, there is practically no way to get a president impeached.

Not only that, it doesn’t look like Steyer and his “Impeach 45” ally, crank Maxine Waters, are going to get “blue wave” Democratic victories in November, either, with the issue.

But hey, maybe this billionaire hypocrite out there on the lunatic fringe will at least get a great tax write-off.

Bush, and Yitzhak Rabin.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by various actors, such as criticizing US foreign policy, calling for the resolution of conflicts, supporting the fight against ISIS, and lamenting US involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,"The article connects events and observations to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, US foreign policy, and extremism in different religions.",False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"At a press briefing for the release of thousands of cabinet documents from 1990-1991 by the National Archives of Australia, former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke criticized US foreign policy as it relates to Israel-Palestine and the greater Middle East.

Hawke criticized President Obama for failing to accomplish any significant progress in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an ebb and flow conflict of land appropriation, nationalism and religious dissonance stemming from the creation of Israel in 1948.

The former prime minister said he believes the key to resolving the many conflicts in the Middle East lies with Israel and Palestine.

“I believe that until the basic issue between Israel nd the Palestinians is resolved, there’s never going to have any hope of any decent situation there,” he said.

Hawke was prime minister of Australia from 1983 to 1991. Telling press at the briefing that he foreshadowed the current quagmire involving ISIS in Iraq and Syria, he said at the time the second Gulf War would increase support for terrorists like Osama Bin Laden.

“I believe it is appropriate that we should be part, whether we should be such a prominent part is a matter for debate, but we should definitely be part of the alliance fighting against IS there in the Middle East,” he said.

Of course, Hawke is right about this, as evidenced just yesterday by the release of a recruitment video from the Somali, al Qaeda affiliated al-Shabaab terror group. The video shows billionaire GOP candidate Donald Trump making a statement last month in which he calls for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.""

Trump has additionally called for unwarranted surveillance of American mosques and a national database of all Muslims, the overwhelming majority of which are innocent of any crime--not to mention the double standard of religious testing this move would establish.

Hawke did not refer to Trump directly, instead remembering his feelings at the start of the Second Gulf War, when US President George W. Bushed invaded Iraq in 2003. “I said Osama bin Laden must be on his hands and knees every morning and night, praying to Allah that Bush would invade Iraq, because nothing would be more conducive to supporting his cause than such an act – and of course that is what happened.”

About the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Hawke lamented the US involvement and constant, immutable support for Israel, despite mounting human rights abuses and illegal land appropriations. He said a more intuitive solution would come from a third party, namely China.

“If China and the US were to sit down together and agree on a process of trying to secure a resolution, the whole chemistry of the situation would change because the simple fact is the Palestinians and the Arab states simply do not trust America,” Hawke noted, adding “They see them as a shield and protector of Israel. If you had the Chinese and Americans working together I think the chemistry would change.”

Hawke called for solidarity with Australia’s large Muslim community, pointing out that extremism exists in all religions and societies. In particular, he invoked the killing of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish terrorist, in response to Rabin’s attempts at peace, albeit minute attempts.

“It wasn’t an [Islamic] fanatic that killed [Yitzhak] Rabin, the prime minister of Israel. It was a Jewish fanatic. The problem is the fanatics of Islam, of Judaism and Christian fanatics,” Hawke said."

An anonymous Deep State whistleblower claims that in the phonecall, Trump used the $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky to open a probe into possible corruption involving 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. The only problem is this: The whistleblower had not actually heard the Trump-Zelensky phone conversation, but based his/her accusation on hearsay.

Being who they are, absence of evidence never stops Demonrats from their never-ending persecution of Trump — a duly-elected President of the United States. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) used the hearsay phonecall as the pretext for the House to move to impeach Trump. Puffed up with faux righteous indigation, Pelosi said: “The president must be held accountable! No one is above the law.”

The 5-page transcript of the Trump-Zelensky phonecall shows that instead of being adversarial, the two presidents were warm and cordial. In the phonecall, Trump made no reference to the $400 million U.S. military aid, nor did he use the aid to coerce Zelensky.

See my post, “Transcript of phonecall between Trump and Ukrainian president shows no wrongdoing“.

Yesterday, Sept. 25, at the United Nations General Assembly, in a joint appearance with Trump before reporters, President Zelensky confirmed what was said and not said in the July 25 phonecall.

Yahoo News reports that asked by reporters if he had felt pressured by Trump to investigate Biden, Zelensky said:

“I think you read everything. So I think you read text. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections of USA. I think we had good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things. I think, and you read it, nobody pushed me.”

About Hunter Biden, Trump said that President Zelensky is “very, very strongly looking into all sorts of corruption,” and that when Hunter Biden “walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine and … they’re paying him millions of dollars, that’s corruption.”

When Joe Biden was Obama’s Vice President, he lobbied for the removal of Ukraine’s State Prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating a Ukrainian energy company that employed Joe’s son, Hunter Biden, who served until earlier this year on the company’s board and was paid a reported $50,000 monthly salary. The investigation into the company ended without charges brought against Hunter.

22,True,The article suggests that there is a conspiracy involving government authorities and pharmaceutical companies to force dangerous vaccines on young girls for profit.,True,"The article mentions Texas Governor Rick Perry, California Governor Jerry Brown, and pharmaceutical company Merck as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,The article mentions the actions of Rick Perry issuing an executive order and the potential signing of a bill by Jerry Brown to force vaccination.,True,The article suggests that the forced vaccination of young girls with potentially dangerous vaccines is a threat to their health.,True,The article connects various events and actions to support the conspiracy theory.,True,The article suggests that information about the potential dangers of the vaccines has been hidden or downplayed by government authorities and pharmaceutical companies.,"Few people had heard of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines prior to Texas Governor James Richard “Rick” Perry’s failed bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

What America learned is that Perry bypassed the legislature and on February 2, 2007 issued an executive order making Texas the first state in the country to force sixth-grade girls to receive the three-shot vaccination series, which cost about $120 per shot, known as Gardasil.



As a presidential candidate, Perry said he was wrong to issue the executive order but still insisted the vaccine saved lives.

Now, new information suggests Gardasil and other HPV vaccines do not protect girls against cervical cancer and have serious, potentially permanent and horrific side effects.

When government works with “Big Pharma” to scare the public, then uses police powers to order dangerous vaccines be given to young girls—and, to top it off, forces taxpayers to foot the bill—how much further away from a free people can we get?

Lest one think that Perry is being singled out, California Governor Jerry Brown (D), once dubbed “Governor Moonbeam” for his purportedly left-flaky point of view, may be close to signing a bill , SB277, that forces all children to get vaccinated before kindergarten.

“The bill now goes to the Assembly,” reported KABC in Sacramento. “It will also require approval from Gov. Jerry Brown. If approved, California would become the third state in the country, joining Mississippi and West Virginia, without either exemption.”

In 2011, Brown signed legislation that gave “children 12 or older the right to obtain preventive treatment for sexually transmitted diseases without parental consent, including an HPV immunization for cervical cancer.”

Famed neurosurgeon Dr. Benjamin Solomon “Ben” Carson, Sr., who recently announced his bid for the Republican nomination, stated unequivocally that vaccines should be mandatory, going further than most by saying that religious and philosophical exemptions should be eliminated.

Are these politicians truly interested in promoting the health of citizens, particularly children?

In Perry’s case, The Washington Post reported he received $29,500 since 2000 in contributions from Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil.

The ties between Merck and Perry raise suspicion. Merck’s Texas lobbyist at the time was Mike Toomey, Perry’s former chief of staff. Merck also funded a phony grassroots—also called “astroturf”—organization called Women in Government (WIG). The Texas state director of WIG was Republican state Representative Dianne White Delisi, mother-in-law of Perry’s then-chief of staff.

Cronyism is nothing new. However, it takes on a new dimension when young children are the potential victims of scare campaigns that result in potentially dangerous vaccines being forced upon them.

What’s encouraging to health activists is that light is being shed upon the potential dangers of HPV vaccines, which may wake up a sleeping public.

Dr. Diane Harper, who helped develop Gardasil, told an international conference on vaccines, “Gardasil is largely unnecessary and it has never been fully tested on females under the age of 15.”

Dr. Harper added, “They created a huge amount of fear in mothers, and appealed to mothers’ sense of duty to get them to get their daughters vaccinated.”

Dr. Harper explained that 70% of HPV infections clear up within a year without treatment and, within two years, 90% recover; the body literally clears the infection on its own accord.

Lucija Tomljenovic, Ph.D., from the Neural Dynamics Research Group in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia, uncovered documents that suggest Merck and government authorities conveniently hid damaging information about Gardasil.

In an interview in a French health journal, Dr. Bernard Dalbergue, a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Gardasil manufacturer Merck, echoing others who are concerned about the safety of the HPV vaccine, made this statement:

The full extent of the Gardasil scandal needs to be assessed. Everyone knew when this vaccine was released on the American market that it would prove to be worthless. Diane Harper, a major opinion leader in the United States, was one of the first to blow the whistle, pointing out the fraud and scam of it all. I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all time because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects, which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose than to generate profit for the manufacturers. Gardasil is useless and costs a fortune. In addition, decision-makers at all levels are aware of it. Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralysis of the lower limbs, vaccine-induced MS and vaccine-induced encephalitis can be found.

If you think you can trust Big Pharma, think again.

Barr said US Attorney from Connecticut John Durham’s review is not expected to lead to a criminal investigation of Biden or Obama.

Last week Acting DNI Richard Grenell declassified the list of Obama officials involved in the unmasking of General Mike Flynn in his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

Names included former CIA Director John Brennan, Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, former DNI chief James Clapper and former Vice President Joe Biden!

We also learned Barack Obama was discussing Flynn’s unmasked calls with Kislyak in a secret Oval Office meeting on January 5, 2017.

However, Bill Barr said based on the information he has today, Durham’s review will not lead to a criminal investigation of Obama or Biden.

“As to President Obama and Vice President Obama, whatever their level of involvement, based on the information I have today, I don’t expect Mr. Durham’s work will lead to a criminal investigation of either man,” Barr said. “Our concern over potential criminality is focused on others.”

Barr said however that Durham’s review of the origins of Spygate are being investigated as potential crimes.

US Attorney General Bill Barr appointed US Attorney from Connecticut John Durham last May to investigate the origins of Spygate.

Award-winning investigative reporter John Solomon told Sean Hannity last month during a podcast interview that he knows of a few witnesses who have appeared before a DC grand jury.

John Solomon told Hannity he believes that Durham’s charges will start with Kevin Clinesmith, the lawyer who fraudulently changed a document to deceive the FISA court.

John Solomon said that John Durham is focusing on false testimonies based on the grand jury subpoenas.

“It’s possible that some people who gave false representations to Congress could get prosecuted for those false representations,” Solomon said.

It implies that the mainstream media is ignoring the truth and diverting attention.,"Financial analyst and stock trader Gregory Mannarino says pay no attention to the rising stock market because it is “fake.” Mannarino says, “The manipulation is absolutely epic. We have never seen anything like it. There is going to be a horrible price to pay for this. Why? Because it will correct to fair market value. There is no doubt in my mind that all of this will correct to fair value. All these distortions can only go so far, and we know this. We have seen this throughout history without exception. . . . We have the biggest bubble in the history of the world, and that is the debt bubble that has re-inflated this stock market bubble, it will burst. It will burst because every single financial bubble in history, without exception, has burst before it. This one is going to burst too, but this one is going to engulf the world. It’s going to be unlike anything we’ve seen in the history of the world, and there is no doubt that the middle class will no longer exist when this occurs. It’s going to be a massive transfer of wealth to these financial institutions that are going to go short all of this. It is legal theft on a magnitude and scale that is unimaginable.”

The mainstream media is ignoring massive fraud by banks. The latest fraud is the admission by Deutsche Bank that it rigged both the gold and silver markets with other big banks. Mannarino says, “Of course, they have to ignore it. They have no choice to ignore it. Why? It’s the system, and the system relies on one thing only and that’s confidence. They can’t allow the general public to understand there is absolute fraud involved in the biggest banks on earth. If the people start to get wind of that, then they are going to start to get afraid. Then, they will pull their cash out of these institutions and start allocating it into different things. They cannot allow the general public to know what’s really going on. They need to keep the general public focused on the stock market. Most people don’t know what to look at, but when they hear, oh the stock market is higher, my 401K is doing well, and that’s all they care about. The same exact thing happened in 2008 when they were watching their houses go up in price. They didn’t care about anything else. When it reversed, then, all of a sudden they’re crying. This is what’s going to happen now, but the magnitude of this one eclipses what happened in 2008–exponentially. The 2008 event, that was a walk in the park eating an ice cream cone compared to what is going to occur at one point here down the line.”

Mannarino goes on to say, “We exist, beyond any shadow of any doubt, are living in an environment where nothing is real, from the prices of assets, to what is going on with the big Wall Street banks, to Federal Reserve interest rates and everything in between. All of this is being played in a way to keep people believing that the system is working and will continue to work. It’s not going to. Let’s look at the stock market. . . . There is no possible way that these multiples can be justified with the price action of stocks in the overall market. They continue to rise. Nothing is real, and I can’t stress this enough.”

On the trend for precious metals and the U.S. dollar, Mannarino says, “We talked about this last time I was on, and I said we would see the dollar down and precious metals up. This was going to happen. We are going to continue to see more fakery and twisting of this entire system. Right now, it’s upside down and nothing is real. We now are in an environment where the financial system has been flipped upside down just to make it function. That’s very scary. . . . We’ve never seen anything like this in the history of the world. We have now hit 10 years for suppressed interest rates in the United States. It can never stop. The Federal Reserve has never been in a situation like this. We are in completely uncharted territory.”

 On October 19, 2012, WikiLeaks released a very curious email, one of WikiLeaks‘ Global Intelligence Files of over 5 million e-mails from the Texas-headquartered “global intelligence” company Stratfor. As WikiLeaks explains:

The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal’s Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor’s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.

The email on May 14, 2009, was from Fred Burton, Stratfor’s vice president of intelligence, to Don R. Kuykendall, then President of Stratfor (Stratfor’s president is now Dave Sikora):

 Obama so loves “pizza,” he’s good pals with James Alefantis, the owner of D.C. pizzeria Comet Ping Pong and former boyfriend of Clinton crony and Democratic Party operative David Brock (of Media Matters).

 Though a mere pizza restaurateur, Alefantis visited the Obama White House four times. One visit was an overnighter in which Alefantis’ group of four included a male porn star. (See Yoichi Shimatsu’s “Capriccio For A Sausage Fest By Chef Alefantis – PizzaGate 8“)

 Meanwhile, former VP Joe Biden stands in solidarity with Obama spending $65,000 of taxpayers’ dollars to fly in “pizzas” and “hotdogs” from Chicago.

 For Obama’s 55th birthday last August, Biden sent him a childish friendship bracelet with beads spelling out “Joe” and “Barack”, and cute charms in the shape of a blue flower, smiley face, blue star and a slice of (“pizza”) pie. (Hollywood Reporter)

Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, Jordan, Syria, Oman and Egypt have all been caught up in a fire storm of anti-government protests. Some appear to be mostly peaceful, such as the pro-democracy movement in Egypt; and some are descending into bloody civil conflict, such as Libya. The multiple revolutions unfolding in the Middle East are really just getting started. Even in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the smell of revolution is in the air and on the Internet. Organizers in the Kingdom are calling for “DAY OF RAGE.” Saudi King Abdullah is so worried he recently announced $37 billion dollars in subsidies and giveaways. That’s enough to pay everybody in Saudi Arabia around $1,500 each. Some look at it as a bribe to encourage citizens not to protest. (Click here to read more.) If Saudi Arabia falls, war will surely follow.

This changing of the guard across the Middle East will be much more impactful to the rest of the world than the fall of the Berlin Wall. The main reason is oil. The Middle East produces most of the world’s petroleum. If supplies are curtailed and shipping lanes are cut, the world could plunge into economic ruin.

It took a little more than 2 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall to collapse the Soviet Union. I look for the same pace of change in the Middle East. The first domino to fall was tiny Tunisia, followed by mighty Egypt with a population of more than 80 million. Egypt has an up-to-date army outfitted with the latest U.S. made weapons. After Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, the military took control of the country. A writer at Foreignpolicy.com recently described the fall of Mubarak this way, “I wish I could be there today, in solidarity with the thousands of young and old Egyptians, to celebrate the demise of his dreadful regime. But what we are witnessing is more than the end of a government — it is nothing less than the birth of a new liberal order in Egypt. And that’s not only good news for the beleaguered citizens of Egypt, but also the United States and Israel.” (Click here to read the complete Foreignpolicy.com post.)

History tells us consistently that big revolutions do not directly lead to democracy. After the French Revolution in 1789, there was mostly crisis and conflict. Napoleon took control 10 years later (1799), and eventually became emperor. His reign was bloody, and he took France to war many times until his last battle in 1815—Waterloo. The Russian Revolution of 1917 was another one of history’s grand upheavals; it produced Communism and Vladimir Lenin. Russia is still without a bona fide democracy today. (The American Revolution is one of the few that directly went to democracy.)

Earlier this month, Harvard history professor Niall Ferguson, wrote a stinging Op-Ed cover story in Newsweek dismantling President Obama’s foreign policy in Egypt. Here’s part of what Ferguson said recently on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program, “. . . I want to emphasize the risks being run in the region. If you look at history, and I am a historian, most revolutions lead not to happy, clappy democracies but to periods of internal turmoil and also periods of terror. And they also lead to external aggression, because the simplest way to mobilize people who are not very well educated like Egypt is to point to the alleged enemy within and then of course the enemy abroad. The scenarios the Israelis are looking at involve a transition not to some kind of peaceful and amicable democracy but to a Muslim Brotherhood dominated regime which then peruses an aggressive policy towards Israel. This is not a zero possibility scenario. This is a high probability scenario, and as far as I can see the President is not considering it.”

Ferguson also points out Mr. Obama is one of the least experienced Presidents in history, when it comes to foreign policy. Ferguson characterized Obama’s handling of the Egyptian revolution as a “flip followed by flop followed by flip.” The “Morning Joe” crew tried to counter Professor Ferguson but was totally out-gunned and out-classed.

“Entomological warfare (EW) is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to attack the enemy. The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program.” – Wikipedia.

(INTELLIHUB) — The bottom line is that we will stop at nothing to bring you prudent, factual, thought-provoking news and opinion from some of the most interesting sources in the world. So needless to say, we will not stop reporting on the “fake snow” or “polymer snow” that has been found in several U.S. cities, including Atlanta, which was mocked by some including “truther” Mark Dice, who wrote it off as a joke early on.

However, after researching nearly one-hundred accounts or claims of this “fake snow” that seemly won’t melt, burning oddly under flame, smelling like plastic– it’s of my opinion that there is something else to this issue and that we are not being told the real truth about the recent cold spells.

So far what we do know is that strange polymer fibers have been found in the snow in several states. We know that snow recently found in several parts of the eastern U.S. smells like burnt plastic when melted under a flame or in a pan (using no butane).

Samples of the snow have even been taken and dried by Henning Kemner, a researcher who posts videos on YouTube, under controlled circumstances. So far, at least one test conducted by Kimner using 2 pounds of fresh snow has shown a rather impressive yield of an ample amount of a dry white powdery residue which Kemner plans to get analyzed spectrally.

However, even to my surprise, new findings posted on YouTube show that America may be under attack by entomological warfare as vast quantities of fleas [insects] have now been found in new snowfall following low-altitude passes by aircraft in Craig, Montana.

Shockingly, this matches up with diabolical tests conducted on human beings by Biological Warfare Unit #731 during the World War II era.

The largest Japanese biological/chemical warfare laboratory was in Ping Fan, a small village near the city of Harbin, Heilongjiang Province in northeast China, known as Unit 731. Unit 731 was a gigantic complex covering six square kilometers and consisted of more than 150 buildings, with living quarters and amenities for up to 3,000 Japanese staff members, 300-500 of whom were medical doctors and scientists. The complex contained various factories. It had 4,500 containers for raising fleas, six giant cauldrons to produce various chemicals, and around 1,800 containers to produce biological agents. Approximately 30 kg of bubonic plague bacteria could be produced there in several days. Especially in the area of biological weapons, Unit 731 could be considered to be the largest such laboratory ever in the world. Not only that it was state of the art, it significantly extended the state of the art, partially because the Japanese had no reluctance at all to experiment with live patients, including doing autopsies while the victims were still alive.

You see under public law substantiated in 1997, all of this has been made possible, allowing the testing of chemicals and biological agents on “Civilian population” as pointed out in my documentary film SHADE the Motion Picture.

PUBLIC LAW 105-85- NOV. 18, 1997: USE OF HUMAN SUBJECTS FOR TESTING OF CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL AGENTSSEC. 1078. RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF HUMAN SUBJECTS FOR TESTING OF CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS.(a) PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES. – The Secretary of Defense may not conduct (directly or by contract)(1) any test or experiment involving the use of a chemical agent or biological agent on a civilian population; or

 (2) any other testing of a chemical agent or biological agent on human subjects.(b) EXCEPTIONS.- Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (e), the prohibition in subsection (a) does not apply to a test or experiment carried out for any of the following purposes:(1) Any peaceful purpose that is related to a medical, therapeutic, pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial, or research activity.

(2) Any purpose that is directly related to protection against toxic chemicals or biological weapons and agents.

(3) Any law enforcement purpose, including any purpose related to riot control.

So section (a) prohibits these cruel and inhumane chemical and biological tests on humans.

Then section (b) says that the prohibitions in section (a) do not apply to tests carried out for virtually any purpose. So section (b) completely negates the prohibitions of section (a).

To no surprise the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has also acknowledged the possibility of using the “plague as a biological weapon” in a white paper about “medical and public health management”.

Yet even with these extremely small numbers, County Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said the stay at home order will “with all certainty” be extended possibly until July or August, according to Fox News.

The good doctor said the following, “Our hope is that by using the data we’d be slowly able to lift restrictions over the next three months. But without widely available therapeutic testing for the coronavirus or rapid at-home testing versions that would allow people to test themselves daily, it seems unlikely that restrictions would be completely eased.“

Gov. Newsom issued the mandatory stay at home order in California on March 19. The goal was to “flatten the curve” together and “bend the curve.”

Two months later and less than .004 percent of the Los Angeles County population has been confirmed to have Wuhan virus and has an even lower percentage of deaths.

Most rational foreign policy experts were aghast when they discovered the lengths the Obama administration went to in order to make its “nuclear deal” with Iran.

It involved loose promises of delayed nuclear development to some timeframe down the road, the shipment of $1.5 billion in cold, hard cash to the Iranian regime (some of it in the middle of the night to free hostages against prior U.S. policy), and the sabotaging of a DEA operation to interdict a $1 billion-per-year drug smuggling operation conducted by Iran proxy Hezbollah.

The Iranian regime used the massive infusion of cash to continue funding its terrorist activities throughout the Middle East, some of which led to the deaths of American troops.

What’s more, it isn’t as if the Obama administration was not aware the Iranians would do that. Then-Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN, “I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists.”

He added: ”You know, to some degree, I’m not going to sit here and tell you that every component of that can be prevented.”

Well, of course it could have been prevented. Had Obama never authorized the transfer of the money in the first place, the Iranians would not have had it to spend…on terrorism…targeting U.S. interests and personnel. (Related: Barack Obama committed treason against America by approving “Spygate” — is he now the focus of investigations?)

But it gets worse that that.

You are likely aware that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad came under siege by militants on Tuesday following American airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq in recent days. What you may not be aware of is that the militants are essentially Iranian proxy forces controlled by Tehran.

Tensions have been increasing in Iraq for months. Iran has been working to influence the political and foreign policy direction of the entire region, including its neighbor and one-time enemy, undermining what remaining influence the United States has there after occupying much of the country for a decade.

‘Trump won’t allow any more Benghazis’

There’s more. The group that led the embassy siege is called the Iraqi Badr Corps, and its leader, Hadi Farhan al-Amiri, was once invited to Obama’s White House.

An official tied to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps was part of the Iraqi delegation that visited the White House Monday for a meeting with President Obama, alarming some who say Iraq’s growing ties to Iran are among the most worrisome aspect of a U.S. pullout.

Hadi Farhan al-Amiri, Iraq’s current transportation minister, accompanied Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and several other top Baghdad advisers on the high-profile visit to Washington timed with the official wind-down of U.S. military involvement in Iraq.

During the rule of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Amiri was head of the Badr Corps, which at the time was backed by the IRGC, “which has been linked to several attacks on Western targets,” Fox News added.

Obama’s diabolical treachery towards his own country was so profound he made deals with terrorist countries, gave them access to billions and billions of dollars, and allowed groups associated with Iran to target and kill American forces that he kept in Iraq and throughout the Middle East as commander-in-chief.

And all while lying to the American people that the deal he was attempting to make with Iran would keep us safe.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

The silver lining in this, however, is that Donald Trump is now president and, as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) reminded us this week, the current commander-in-chief isn’t going to tolerate any “Bengazis.”"

The comments by Charlie Black, who is arguably Mr McCain’s most experienced adviser, put into words what many Republicans and Democrats have privately been stating for months.

Mr Black, 60, who is a veteran of every Republican presidential campaign since the 1980s and served in the Reagan and Bush Senior administrations, immediately apologised for his remarks, which were published in an interview with Fortune Magazine.

Mr McCain, whom opinion polls show is trailing Barack Obama, his Democratic rival, by between six and 15 points, said: “I cannot imagine why he would say it. I strenuously disagree?.?.?.?It’s not true. I have worked tirelessly since 9/11 to prevent another terrorist attack on America.”

The Obama campaign said: “The fact that John McCain’s top adviser says that a terrorist attack on American soil would be a ‘big advantage’ for their political campaign is a complete disgrace and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change.”

The controversy arrived at a bad moment for the McCain campaign, which has come under increasing fire from otherwise friendly Republicans for its alleged amateurism. Critics say it has sent out mixed signals about Mr McCain’s political direction and shown a lack of “message discipline”.

For example, last week the campaign put out a televised advertisement stressing Mr McCain’s credentials on global warming on the same day that he gave a speech in Houston calling for a lifting of the moratorium on offshore drilling.

Republican consultants also worry the campaign has not invested in on-the-ground operations in swing states, such as Ohio, to nearly the degree as George W. Bush did in 2004 or as has the Obama campaign.

Although many commentators may agree with Mr Black, his remarks are likely to result in calls for Mr McCain to remove him. Democrats have accused Mr McCain of hypocrisy for portraying himself as a political reformer while relying on several prominent working and former lobbyists for advice and fundraising.

As one of those lobbyists Mr Black – who headed the lobbying firm BKSH until he resigned in March – has also been targeted by groups that allege hypocrisy in Mr McCain’s critical stance on such firms. Some McCain staff, including Tom Loeffler, a senior fundraiser who previously lobbied for Saudi Arabia’s government, have resigned from the campaign.

MoveOn.org, the liberal activist group, recently launched a television advertisement calling for Mr McCain to fire Mr Black because of his lobbying work for foreign dictators, including Joseph Savimibi of Angola and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines.

According to recent opinion polls Mr Obama has a clear lead over Mr McCain on almost every domestic issue. However, both Mr McCain and the Republican party in general continue to hold an edge on national security and terrorism. Electoral analysts believe a McCain victory in November would likely arise from an election dominated by national security concerns."

Globalist worried about Presidents threat to the new world order

Billionaire globalists George Soros has described President Donald Trump as a 'danger to the world' during a dinner he hosted at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Soros told his audience he believed that Donald Trump was attempting to create a 'mafia state' in the US, but couldn't due to the underlying institutions within the country. Despite Soros's claim, he didn't elaborate on what he actually meant.

""I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world,'"" Soros said

Soros went on to predict a Democratic 'landslide' in the 2018 elections, putting an end t the Trump era.

'I give President Trump credit for motivating his core supporters brilliantly, but for every core supporter he has created a greater number of core opponents who are.""

The globalist leaders present at Davos included German Chancellor Angela Merkel who, when questioned about the rise of nationalism, she called it a “poison.”“I hope it is not going to grow, but it is a poison,” she said Wednesday.

“Germany wishes to be a country that lends its contribution in the future to solve the problems of the world together, we think that shutting ourselves off and isolating ourselves will not lead us into a good future. Protectionism is not the proper answer.”

DailyMail reports: Trump found a softer way to package his 'America First' agenda he strode through the conference center on his first day in Davos, calling for prosperity and 'great peace'.

'I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace,' Trump said after holding back-to-back meetings with British Prime Minister Theresa May and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Soros has been a consistent critic of Trump who is also in Davos, the first US president to attend since Bill Clinton in 2000. Trump is pictured at the World Economic Forum on Thursday

'And I think that really is the message,' Trump told pool reporters who trailed him at each scheduled meeting at the gathering of bigwigs in the snowy Alpine town.

Trump also renewed his public pitch for investors to pour money into the US.

A lot of people are coming back to the US. 'We are seeing tremendous investment,' he said. 'And today's been a very exciting day, very great day and great for our country,' the president said.

Trump landed on Thursday in Switzerland, where his outsized personality and determination to push an 'America First' agenda was upending the annual Davos conference.

To an extent, the annual confab of billionaires and CEOs was centering around Trump even before Air Force One touched down in Zurich, then flew aboard Marine One to Davos in the Swiss Alps."

From the former crown jewel of Operation Mockingbird, The Washington Post:

This is almost funny coming from a news organization that pushed one of the most deadly conspiracy theories of modern times: Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and, after none were found, George Bush made a comedy routine out of the fact Iraq didn’t have nuclear and biological weapons programs.

This “hate speech” resulted in the murder of more than 1.5 million people. That should qualify The Washington Post, which unquestioningly published war propaganda along with its sibling The New York Times, as the King of Fake News.

I don’t claim to know what happened at Sandy Hook. However, questioning the official version of that event and others is not a hate crime, no matter how outrageous.

Must-read: 4 Examples of Mainstream Media Fabricating News to Push for War

Alex Jones is his own worst enemy. He courts this kind of publicity. (…) His support for Donald Trump is part of the drive to get more listeners and customers.

Finally, this is a long anticipated precedent that will spread like a California wildfire. The action against Jones will be used against others. I wager that within a year many if not most of the more popular “alt-right” and “New Right” personalities will be dumped by the social media giants. It can then concentrate on the propaganda news stream, selfies, chili recipes, and puppy pictures.

After the midterm elections and the inevitable accusation that Russia skewered the results by propagandizing the public, this purge will extend to the internet proper and the end result will be more regulation designed to keep the truth from spreading. It will be sold as a defensive move to save democracy when, in fact, the result will be the exact opposite.

Banning Alex Jones has very little to do with dead children or hate speech. It’s about the government and its corporate partners taking back the media so it can resume the urgent task of propagandizing the American people and thus gain their ill-informed consensus for endless war and the perpetuation of rigged economic and political systems.

This implies secrecy and attempts to mislead the public.,"Good. Now he needs a serious punishment.

From NY Post: The feds busted a Defense Intelligence Agency worker Wednesday for leaking classified national defense information to two journalists in 2018 and 2019 — one of whom he was shacking up with.

Henry Kyle Frese, 30, a counterintelligence analyst from Alexandria, Virginia, who had a Top Secret security clearance, was indicted Tuesday on two counts of willful transmission of national defense information to persons not entitled to receive it.

“Frese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain,” said John C. Demers, assistant attorney general for national security, who cited ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ vow to pursue leakers as the motivation for the probe.

“Frese betrayed the trust placed in him by the American people — a betrayal that risked harming the national security of this country. This is one of six unauthorized disclosure cases the Department has charged in just over two years, and we will continue in our efforts to punish and deter this behavior.”

According to court documents, between mid-April and early May 2018, Frese took classified intelligence reports, some of which were unrelated to his job duties, and using his cellphone, gave top secret information about a foreign country’s weapons systems to an unnamed journalist.

Frese and the journalist had the same residential address for a year starting in August 2017, and, based on Frese’s social media pages, “it appears that they were involved in a romantic relationship for some or all of that period of time,” the feds said in a statement.

The release of the unspecified secrets could be “expected to cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security of the United States,” they said, declining to elaborate.

The first journalist then asked Frese if he would be willing to help another journalist who was her colleague. The names of the journalists and the news organizations they worked for were not revealed.

“Frese stated that he was ‘down’ to help Journalist 2 if it helped Journalist 1 because he wanted to see Journalist 1 ‘progress,’” the statement said.

The first journalist would ask Frese for certain information for articles she was writing for an unnamed publication, and she published at least eight articles that were allegedly based on classified information.

The second journalist also published articles based on the information.

If convicted, Frese faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each count.

The feds would not say during a conference call whether the two journalists would be prosecuted, or talk about specifics.

Stay safe, stay home, and only watch and read what we tell you to watch and read. This is the message being sent to the world by Facebook, Twitter, and the rest of the Big Tech oligopoly, which has systematically banned the Plandemic documentary and censored the mention of Judy Mikovits and her book Plague of Corruption: Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science.

Because it became so popular so quickly, Plandemic became a quick target for Facebook and YouTube, which on May 7 announced that they had removed the film for making “medically unsubstantiated” claims about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The film also features clips of Mikovits, who is known for her position that most vaccines are dangerous.

Mikovits is a whistleblower who used to work for the National Cancer Institute. Much of her research centers around studying retroviruses like HIV, which French virologist and Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier has said contains similar DNA to that of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

She does not agree with mask wearing, citing its dangers; she does not support the shutdown orders that have been implemented across the United States; and she thinks that people should be allowed to continue congregating if they so choose. And because of all this, Mikovits is not allowed to have a voice on social media.

In Plandemic, Mikovits claims that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is a conspiracy hatched by interests which stand to profit from the development of a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. She also expresses concerns about vaccines in general, warning about the unintended consequences they can have on innocent lives.

YouTube, working in tandem with Facebook, has been feverishly pulling all copies of Plandemic from every channel it can find, and this writer can confirm that the same thing is happening on Vimeo. In order to avoid the censors, however, some channels are uploading slightly edited versions of the film.

Twitter is likewise blocking the hashtags #Plandemicmovie and #PlagueOfCorruption because they contain “misinformation,” according to the Jack Dorsey empire. Twitter is not, however, removing shorter clips of the film.

The full Plandemic film has been posted by “Jesus Social Network” on Brighteon.com, a free speech video network that remains one of the very few places where users can find the documentary:

World Health Organization behind Big Tech push to censor “harmful content” about coronavirus

The Big Tech censorship agenda has really kicked into high gear ever since the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) began spreading in the United States and other Western nations. And a big reason for this is the World Health Organization (WHO), which has reportedly been pressuring the tech giants to censor “harmful content” and “misinformation” about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

It would seem as though there is only one narrative allowed concerning this pandemic, and that narrative portends that the virus is so bad that everyone’s freedoms need to be taken away, including the right not to vaccinate, as part of the “new normal.”

This is yet another powerful reminder as to why all tech companies need to have their Communications Decency Act (CDA) “Safe Harbor” protections immediately removed. If they are going to act as content publishers rather than content providers, then they no longer qualify for immunity from censorship charges.

“There will need to be significant reforms of policies such as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in order to keep social media titans from completely shutting out dissident voices,” writes Jose Nino for Big League Politics.

What you probably don’t know about Western Medicine is that infectious diseases virtually disappeared before vaccines were ever invented. Since the early 1900s, it has been a known scientific fact that an animal that survives an attack from poliomyelitis becomes resistant to subsequent infections forever. It’s also a known fact that polio is one of the least serious infectious diseases, despite the fear-mongering propaganda that suggests just the opposite.

You see, most people in history who have been infected with polio incur a mild infection lasting only a few days. Yes, there is a rare complication of the disease that can destroy motor cells in the brain and spinal cord. This is the complication that Big Pharma and the US government use to coerce people into getting vaccinated with various experimental strains of the virus that have never been proven to provide humans with lasting immunity.

In fact, the factors that actually caused the decline of polio after 1950 did not include the famous Dr. Salk “miracle” vaccine at all. The large-scale polio vaccination program was a complete and utter failure, and according to the August 1997 edition of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, more than half of children affected by poliomyelitis received three doses of the oral polio vaccine before the onset of paralysis. The truth? The true causes of the spread of Polio include pre-polio vaccines, nutritional imbalances and pesticides, all of which contribute to immune deficiency.

CDC declares useless Polio vaccine “safe, potent and efficient” while the media declare it the “greatest medical discovery of the century”

Here’s how it all went down. One year after scientists discovered they could grow the polio viruses in tissue cultures, Dr. Jonas Salk was paid by five pharma companies to brew the polio virus in monkey kidney cells and dilute them with formaldehyde. Dr. Salk and his associates isolated more than 70 different strains of the three main types of polio, Brunhilde, Lansing and Leon. Salk then mixed the three different strains of the virus together, which by the way is very dangerous and unpredictable, and injected it into live monkeys, rabbits and mice. No human beings were ever tested.

Voila! He announced that a cure had been found, and mass media helped spread the propaganda. Nearly every American newspaper declared that Dr. Salk had abolished poliomyelitis. Immediately following the proclaimed prevention medicine for Polio, the Foundation for Infantile Paralysis ran press releases and lied, saying that Dr. Jonas Salk invented and tested this miracle drug. The foundation called for the manufacture of nine million doses for injecting children and pregnant women.

History shows disastrous news came after 9 million doses of polio vaccine were injected into humans – the inoculated children began contracting polio

Children immunized with the polio vaccine began shedding the virus (or combinations of it) to their parents and siblings. Vaccinated children became the new carriers, and just like today, Western Medicine blamed the unvaccinated, creating hysteria that spread across the nation. In June of 1955, the American Public Health Service announced nearly 150 confirmed cases of poliomyelitis among the vaccinated, including six deaths. Where on those victims did the paralysis begin? In the limb where the vaccine had been injected, of course. Coincidence? There’s more evidence the polio vaccine was a complete failure and the vaccinated children were spreading it, because polio had now struck in areas where there had been no cases reported for nearly a year. What happened next is astounding. The vaccine was suspended pending a full inquiry by the National Institute of Health (NIH).

The bottom line is that the “epidemic” of polio had already significantly declined by 1955, when the vaccine was first introduced. Polio was just a mild disease seldom resulting in paralysis. You see, after the “miracle” polio vaccine invention, the polio cases that did not result in paralysis were simply diagnosed by US doctors as meningitis, so that the ratio of new polio cases were severely skewed to intimidate and horrify the masses. It was all propaganda.

Plus, those new cases were mostly spread by shedders who had been inoculated with the polio vaccine, but the media blamed the unvaccinated, just like they do today with mumps and measles outbreaks. Plus, at the time, test results of the Salk vaccine were only based on data from the eleven (of the thirty-three) US states that favored the statistics the industry desired. Get it? The vaccine literally caused a rise in polio cases, but the epidemic was redefined.

What’s even scarier is the fact that the CDC vaccinated nearly 100 million Americans with polio shots that contained the cancer-causing SV40 virus, which was first discovered in monkeys back in 1960. Still wondering why so many kids suffer from childhood leukemia, bone cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma?

True medical history now reveals that Dr. Jonas F. Salk, the so-called “Father of Vaccines,” did not cure Polio at all, but rather created new strains of it and spread it to more innocent people through infected carriers called shedders. The CDC still to this day refuses to run a true double-blind, placebo-controlled study contrasting vaccinated vs. unvaccinated children."

The novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China has spread in other countries at an alarming rate. Now, health officials are urging Americans to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak as the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. begins to rise.

Just last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned the public that the novel coronavirus is expected to spread at a community level at any given time. They asked people to prepare for possible school closures and remote work.

According to Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the virus has moved rapidly from country to country via community spread. As the number of cases around the world continues to rise, successful containment at U.S. borders becomes harder and harder.

“We want to make sure the American public is prepared,” Messonnier told reporters.

Community spread of COVID-19, first instance in Northern California

Right on the heels of the public warning from CDC, reports emerged of an unusual case of COVID-19 infection in Northern California.

The patient was confirmed to be a resident of Solano County and was diagnosed by clinicians in Sacramento. The patient had not traveled outside the U.S. and had no known contact with an infected person.

In a statement, the CDC called the case a “possible instance of community spread of COVID-19” — the first to happen in the United States. The agency defines community spread as the “spread of an illness for which the source of infection is unknown.”

On the other hand, the CDC also acknowledged the possibility of the virus being transmitted by an infected return traveler.

As of February 26, the agency has confirmed a total of 15 COVID-19 cases across the country.

Two days after the state of California confirmed its first likely case of community transmission, news of another case emerged about 90 miles away from Solano County. The infected individual was a 65-year-old resident of Santa Clara County, who, like the first patient, had not traveled or been in contact with a known case.

On February 29, the Washington Post reported a similar case of infection in Washington County in the northwest part of Oregon. The unnamed individual was an employee of a local elementary school and tested positive for COVID-19.

As of writing, the U.S. death toll has now risen to six, and the number of reported COVID-19 cases across 14 states has exceeded a hundred, reports the Washington Post.

The states of Washington and Florida have also declared states of emergency. (Related: Why are so many new coronavirus cases emerging in Washington state? Because it’s been spreading there for SIX WEEKS.)

In her statement last week, Messonnier said that the disruption the coronavirus outbreak would bring to everyday life might be severe. She urged businesses to start considering the options they can offer to their employees and advised parents to coordinate with their children’s schools in case school closure is unavoidable.

In contrast, Bruce Aylward, a senior official of the World Health Organization (WHO), expressed confidence that the spread of the COVID-19 virus can be stopped — as long as countries are willing to commit.

“The thing you’ve got to think is: If it hits us, we’re going to stop it. You have to think that way. I keep hearing, ‘Oh, if it hits us we just have to accept it and it’s going to spread.’ Why? You’ve lost before you’ve started,” Aylward said during a briefing at the WHO headquarters in Geneva.

As part of its preparation for a possible outbreak, the CDC is studying measures that can be used to stop the spread of the virus. These include social distancing strategies, voluntary home quarantines and methods for disinfecting surfaces. Messonnier also said that the agency is considering changing the case definition to improve the criteria for viral testing.

With the threat of community spread of COVID-19, improvements in this area could facilitate early detection of the virus and those infected."

Mandatory Vaccine Bill Fails After Thousands Show Up to Protest in New Jersey

A bill in New Jersey that would’ve stripped parents and children of their right to informed consent by allowing them to object to mandatory vaccinations failed on Monday. Much to the chagrin of the tyrants who claim ownership over the bodies of others, the bill that would have eliminated religious exemptions to mandatory vaccinations failed to pass the New Jersey state legislature.

According to reports, the bill was canceled in the Senate before the vote because lawmakers knew they lacked the passing votes. The proponents of the bill vowed to reintroduce it on Tuesday but this gives opponents a new time frame on the public hearing and voting process.

The victory for medical freedom was an emotional and dramatic one as thousands of pro-freedom protesters showed up at the Statehouse to voice their concern over the government removing their right to informed consent. Naturally, those who want to remove your freedom of choice and sovereignty over your own body and force you to take an injection even if it goes against everything you believe in, were furious. They even vowed “war.”

Others, who don’t agree with the government forcing people to undergo medical procedures against their will, disagreed.

Sue Collins, co-founder of the New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice, told NJ.com this was “a victory for both religious and medical freedoms” in the state.

The battle over this bill began last year when the United States saw a rise in measles cases across the country. While New Jersey saw just 19 cases, ground zero was just to the north of them. More than 70 percent of the 1,282 cases in the nation occurred, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Rockland County, NY and New York City. In 61 of these cases, patients were hospitalized with complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis, the CDC said. There were zero deaths.

Since the beginning of 2019, the Free Thought Project has been reporting on the hysteria associated with the measles outbreak and the subsequent loss of liberties and police state crackdown that’s ensued. We’ve seen children banned from public spaces, mandatory vaccinations enforced with police action, and a pro-vaccine push in the mainstream media like we’ve never seen before. In May, the pro-mandatory vaccine push reached a new level, as the Washington Post published an article calling for the arrest of those who choose not to vaccinate. In August, we reported on the inevitable result of said hysteria and it came in the form of massive pharmaceutical industry profits and a loss of freedom.

The pharmaceutical giant Merck said consumer demand for its measles vaccine skyrocketed thanks to the “outbreak” which helped boost sales in its second quarter. Merck Chief Commercial Officer Frank Clyburn even mentioned the coverage in the news specifically.

The failure of this bill in New Jersey is a massive win in a time when there are very few wins for medical freedom.

To reiterate once more, no one here is advocating “antivaxxer” information. TFTP is simply questioning the policy of the government forcing medical procedures on citizens without their consent and advocating for fines and arrests of those who refuse. If you truly value freedom, you should also stand against forcing someone to inject something into their body that they do not want. The only other option is tyranny.

They comment in amazement and concern on the ignition metrics, fuel consumption and intense heat being generated by these fires. Could there be a connection between the intentionally sprayed aerosol particulate trails (which contain aluminum and barium) and the intense heat being generated by these fires?

A fire truck moves position as flames from the Rocky fire approach near Clearlake, California

Aluminum is a powerful conductor of electricity and heat. Because it's lighter than copper, it is often used in aircraft to cut down on weight. Electrical contractors use aluminum wire as a substitute for copper because of its lower cost per foot. Remember, nano-sized particles contained in the aerosols are an infinitesimally fine dust. They are a metal, and they do coat the leaves, the duff below the tree canopy and fuel sources on the ground. When this dust ignites, which it does because it is not in its dense form, an un-natural, tremendous quantity of heat is generated. Coupled with the extreme dryness caused by bad actors engineering our drought, and you have the ingredients for catastrophic destructive forces. One would not be going out on a limb by characterizing the unfolding events as a false flag, having been consciously (or unconsciously) engineered ahead of time. If the pseudoscientific thinking behind the geo-engineering were truly scientific, they would have factored ignition effects of aluminum into the equation before deciding to move forward with their plans to drought the state using aluminum, barium and strontium, known desiccants with powerful drying properties.

Where is the governor during all this? He’s signing legislation that will force Californian’s into mandatory vaccinations that science has shown can cause autism and death in children and adults. Parents must now decide whether to compromise their children’s health risks, or bear the expense of private or home schooling. Jerry Brown is also preparing to strip private property rights to water on privately owned lands.

If you think there’s something wrong with this picture, you’re not a conspiracy theorist, you’re conspiracy analyst. Think for a minute about the possibility of continued aerosol activity leading to fresh produce and grape production cut backs. You can see, regardless of the intentions behind the parties geoengineering pseudoscientific nonsense, the entire program to drought the west has no science to support it; that is unless the science is a military strategy of aggression… in which case it makes perfect sense.

The evidence is mounting against the powerful interests behind this epic violation of nature and its balanced forces. There can be no valid argument for what’s been going on in the skies above our heads for the last decade. The point of critical mass has arrived. Pretending it will go away is more than foolish, it's abetting criminal behavior. The public deserves an explanation and it deserves that explanation now."
43,True,"The article raises concerns about vaccinations and suggests a link between vaccines and Autism, which goes against the mainstream scientific consensus.",True,"The article mentions Donald Trump, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, the government, and Bill Gates as actors involved in the vaccination issue.",True,The article discusses the actions of Donald Trump speaking out against vaccines and the increasing number of required immunizations.,True,The article suggests that vaccines may cause neurological damage and contribute to the Autism epidemic.,True,The article connects events and observations to support the idea that vaccines are linked to Autism.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"In a stunning development for the ostracized, often criticized, vaccine safety awareness movement, cause celebre, and business mogul, Donald Trump raised concern about vaccinations on Monday, April 2, the anniversary of the fifth annual World Autism Awareness Day. Trump ‘warned’ Fox News viewers he “stronglybelieves that Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are linked to exposure to vaccines.”1

During the interview, the tycoon revealed that a series of casual observations led him to the conclusion that ‘”monster” vaccinations cause Autism. The remark was probably a bombshell for pro-vaccine advocates including doctors, pharmaceutical companies, the government – and oh yes, Bill Gates. They have all fervently denied that observation -long a tenet of ‘science-based research’ – has anything to do with a medical outcome.

Trump acknowledged that speaking out against vaccines and the vaccine schedule is very controversial. But then he went on to state: “…I couldn’t care less. I’ve seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations and a month later the child is no longer healthy.”

Trump’s statement is a victory for parents who have long believed vaccines contributed to the neurological damage their children suffered post -vaccination. Although Trump is not against vaccines, he has spoken out before regarding his concerns about the increasing number of required immunizations in the childhood vaccination schedule.

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) just released a study based on 2008 data revealing Autism rates have risen to an all-time high. Health records for 8 year old children in 14 states were analyzed showing Autism now affects 1 in 88 children; and 1 in 54 boys in the U.S.2.

Between 1960 and 1980 – children were subjected to 24 and 25 doses of vaccines. As of 2010, infants and children are exposed to 70 vaccines in the same time period. To put this in perspective – a child born today will receive more vaccine doses by the time he is six months old than his mother did by the time she went to college. With the addition of vaccinations to the adult schedule; a person will receive close to 167 vaccine doses over their lifetime.It is interesting to note that Alzheimer’s rates are also increasing as more vaccines are administered to senior citizens. Subsequently vaccine manufacturers are now wallowing in a 27 billion dollar a year industry. At what cost to our children; at what financial loss to America’s families?

The CDC data even becomes more compelling when individual state demographic rates are examined. The number of children identified with ASDs ranged from 1 in 210 children in Alabama to 1 in 49 children in New Jersey and 1 in 47 children in Utah. On the other hand the state of Iowa is showing 1 in 718 children are at risk for ASDs.

Four states – four different environments – with wide variations in state-wide levels of environmental toxic exposure. If one only considered the theory of environmental pollution, New Jersey, in comparison to the other three states would be an obvious concern. But, what about Iowa? Toxic chemicals from pesticides have certainly affected the waterways. And yet, their children are the most protected from ASDs. Alabama and Utah on the other hand have high rates of vaccination compliance – very low environmental pollution – and their rates of autism are showing the greatest concern.3.

ASDs Neurological Disorders Now Showing in the Adolescent Population

With the introduction of HPV vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix into the adolescent vaccine schedule, symptoms eerily similar to ASDs are now emerging in the 9 to 26 year old male and female population.

 SANE Vax has been following the VAERS data over the past 6 months and have been saddened to see the increase in the number of adverse injuries and deaths that have occurred post-vaccination.

It is more than apparent government health authorities, politicians, and the medical industry are going to continue whitewashing the sacred vaccine cash cow until medical consumers are faced with the largest scandal the world has ever witnessed.

Medical consumers can no longer trust the “First do no harm” platitude. The harm has been done. The United States is dealing with a full-fledged Autism epidemic and the global media is reporting it. We cannot stand idly by and watch the pandemic spread throughout the world. Medical consumers must hold those in charge of creating this man-made plague accountable for their actions before it’s too late."

YouTube has deleted the conspiracy theorist David Icke’s official channel from its platform.

The Google-owned video clip service acted after repeatedly warning Mr Icke that he had violated its policies by posting misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic.

However, the firm will still allow videos posted by others that feature Mr Icke to remain live, so long as their content does not break its rules. It follows a similar ban by Facebook .

“YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS,” a spokeswoman told the BBC.

“Due to continued violation of these policies, we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.”

The channel had more than 900,000 subscribers at the time it was removed. The last clip Mr Icke had posted on Friday – about his Facebook ban – had about 120,000 views.

YouTube confirmed Mr Icke would not be allowed to start again by setting up a new channel.

Last month, a live-streamed interview with Mr Icke posted by another account prompted YouTube to ban all conspiracy theory videos falsely linking coronavirus symptoms to 5G mobile phone networks.

The tech firm subsequently went further by banning any material that:
• contains medically unsubstantiated diagnostic advice about the virus
• explicitly disputes the efficacy of guidance about social distancing and self-isolation that has been issued by the WHO and/or local health authorities

Some civil rights groups have previously expressed concern about “growing online censorship around the coronavirus pandemic” by the major social networks.

“It is through a free forum of ideas that citizens understand, contextualise and trust information, not through harsh restrictions on information sharing,” they wrote to YouTube on 16 April ."

In our society’s quest to fool our children into believing that life is a risk-free, pain-free endeavor where they are never supposed to experience anything bad, the latest development in the charade is the needle-free vaccine. As bad as forced vaccination is, we apparently make it worse for our children when we expose them to a little temporary pain.

But for the coming flu season anyway, kids will still get to experience a little bit of real life: Pediatricians, as well as vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have rejected FluMist, the first nasal spray influenza vaccine, ostensibly because it has proven regularly ineffective at preventing the flu.

As reported by NBC News, new research appears to show that actual flu shots “provided significantly better protection” in recent years when compared to the nasal spray vaccine, says Dr. Henry Bernstein of Cohen’s Children’s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York. Bernstein is one of the physicians who issued a statement on flu vaccines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP.

He went on to tell the news network that while parents want their kids to be protected against influenza and still have the choice of avoiding an injection, “I think that people recognize that flu vaccine is the best preventative measure that we have” to offer flu protection.

But is that really true? Or is there a different agenda – other than over-protecting our kids – at work here? Some believe that aerial spraying of vaccines is the eventual goal.

For its part, FluMist maker AstraZeneca defended its product and claimed that it was very effective, according to European studies. Also, the drug maker said, a Canadian study affirmed that aerosol versions of flu vaccine were effective when used on 52 Hutterite colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Proving aerosol vaccinations effective at delivering the proper dosage of a live virus is not something out of a science fiction movie plot. It’s a real concept, and it was recently approved for deployment in Australia, according to one report.

And The Liberty Beacon has also reported on the aerial vaccination concept, which is steadily progressing and is being tested via the release of chemtrails.

As noted by Global Research, a Canadian think tank, aerial spraying of a chemical aimed at eliminating Zika virus-carrying mosquitoes has already been approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even though there was no prior evidence to suggest that the chemical would be effective.

In addition, the CDC published a proposed rule in mid-August that, if implemented, would grant the government authority (unto itself) to forcibly vaccinate Americans who have been forcibly quarantined as a way to control communicable diseases. While the method of vaccination was not specifically mentioned, the fact that the government and private industry are working together to perfect an aerosol version should give every freedom-loving citizen pause."

But there’s trouble in paradise as new reports are showing that “recovered” patients are testing positive for the virus a second time.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) issued a statement following a formal investigation revealing that dozens of patients who were believed to have been “cured” either still have the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) inside their bodies, or are catching it a second time because it’s still showing up in tests.

“While we are putting more weight on reactivation as the possible cause, we are conducting a comprehensive study on this,” said KCDC Director-General Jeong Eun-kyeong. “There have been many cases when a patient during treatment will test negative one day and positive another.”

As we reported, a similar phenomenon was occurring in South China’s Guangdong province back in late February, as “recovered” patients there were succumbing to the virus more than once.

Also back in February, Japan had reported its first case of a person testing positive twice for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), prompting health officials to warn that the virus can remain dormant inside the body for a while before eventually manifesting in the lungs and causing problems.

“Once you have the infection, it could remain dormant with minimal symptoms,” says Philip Tierno Jr., a professor of microbiology and pathology at New York University. “And then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs.”

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the globalists are using the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to test how much tyranny humans are willing to accept:

While there have been a number of such cases in communist China as well, the regime there has been intentionally leaving them out of its official count. It’s also been leaving out all asymptomatic carriers of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which has kept the numbers artificially low.

“I have no idea why the authorities choose not to count [asymptomatic] cases in the official case count,” one doctor reportedly told the media after experiencing a second positive coronavirus test in a patient who had supposedly recovered. “I am baffled.”

The World Health Organization (WHO) also announced that it’s unclear whether or not people who recover from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) actually develop the antibodies necessary to fight a second infection. This would explain why many people are getting it a second time.

“With regards to recovery and then reinfection, I believe we do not have the answers to that,” stated Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s emergencies program, during a recent press conference at the group’s Geneva headquarters.

A preliminary study of patients in Shanghai found that some of them had “no detectable antibody response” while other did, an inexplicable anomaly that has no clear answer. Meanwhile, more than 300,000 of the roughly 1.87 million cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that have been identified around the world are said to have recovered, though more data is needed to determine how many of them actually have immunity.

“That’s something that we really need to better understand is what does that antibody response look like in terms of immunity,” says Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s lead scientist on the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

The Gargoyle, Democrat Senator Richard “Stolen Valor” Blumenthal, joined Wolf Blitzer for some typical Trump bashing and propagandizing, this time in support of comrade Mueller’s open-ended, get Trump no matter what, witch hunt. With the House Intelligence Committee having moved on to real business and ended their snipe hunt Russia investigation, Blumenthal has replaced Bobble-Head Adam Schiff as the face of the Democrat plot to overthrow President Trump. [[WATCHVIDEO BELOW]]

It’s Blumenthal’s lucky day, as not only does he get to go on television and scare little children as he talks about the morphing Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, but he also gets to talk gun-grabbing after another instance in which a gun fired itself after stowing away on the person of a human and gaining access to its intended target. He says, “My hearts and prayers go out to blah, blah, blah.” Gargoyles have multiple hearts?

Wolf moves on to the coup attempt and the latest revelation of an August 2017 Rosenstein memo that the CNN hack claims declares that “Mueller is open to go ahead and investigate a whole bunch of areas involving alleged collusion.” Actually Blitzer is no more honest than Blumenthal, he’s blatantly lying.

The memo merely restates that Mueller can investigate the same allegations of collusion that were in the initial memo creating his phony position and that he can investigate interactions with Ukraine prior to his involvement with the Trump campaign. That’s beyond the authority of Rosenstein, as Sessions did not recuse himself from anything to do with Ukraine, and Rosenstein can’t order the special prosecutor to investigate it. Facts sometimes get in Wolf’s way – he’s a Democrat.

Of course Blumenthal is going to distort and exaggerate both what the memo says its impact. He says, “This memorandum is profoundly significant” because of a message that he interprets it to send, “that Robert Mueller is at the doors of the Oval Office and he’s knocking and he’s knocking hard.” There’s no way he could legitimately interpret that memo to be anything of that nature. And it’s only significant to the degree that it exposes the Rosenstein-Mueller corruption.

Somehow he claims to have determined from this nothing memo that the witch hunt can no longer be considered to be that. Again, if anything, it serves as further proof of it being a witch hunt and nothing more. And how many boilerplate memos did Rosenstein write, to cover every potential eventuality, to selectively release them if they were to later become useful?

Blumenthal falsely claims that there is a footnote in the memo that deals with obstruction of justice. There is no footnote of any kind. The last paragraph instructs Mueller to contact Rosenstein if he needs an expansion of his parameters, but there is no mention of obstruction of justice. Just like when he claimed to have served in Vietnam, “Stolen Valor” Blumenthal is lying, knowing that most will never read the memo on their own and take him at his worthless word.

Blitzer then quotes from the memo and asks Blumenthal, based upon the use of the word “collusion” in the instructions to Mueller, if the DOJ has now declared the non-crime of “collusion” to be a crime. Blumenthal the memo clearly indicates that it’s a serious crime, absent any statute that makes it one. Just like they’re making up their own laws on a special counsel, they’ll write their own criminal statutes as well.

Blumenthal will say anything that pops into that grotesque head of his with no consideration of whether or not it’s even remotely factual or accurate. He’s the ideal spokesman for the communist Democrat coup against our President.

It will probably come as no big shock to Natural News readers that this past season’s flu shot was an abysmal failure – even more so than normal. But you’d never know this from reading a recent junk science piece published by The New York Times (NYT), which completely bastardized the findings of a Cochrane collaboration meta-analysis to claim that everyone should still get their annual influenza jab in order to promote “public health.”

Penned by Aaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine, the NYT article, entitled, “Why It’s Still Worth Getting a Flu Shot,” reads like your average vaccine industry propaganda pamphlet, complete with the usual shameless exploitation of actual science in order to make completely pseudoscientific claims about the “merits” of flu jabs.

In his propaganda piece, Carroll admits that last season’s flu shot was improperly matched to the circulating flu strain, which means it didn’t help anybody, and likely harmed many. But because flu shots in general are so amazingly safe, in Carroll’s view – this baseless claim underpinning the premise of all that follows in his article – there’s simply no reason not to get one.

After getting that out of the way, Carroll proceeds to cite two studies published in the prestigious Cochrane database that he says support of his claim that flu shots are 100 percent safe and effective, always. But the reality is that neither of the two studies Carroll cited actually support this claim because he completely misrepresented their findings in his article – something that the NYT clearly had no issue with, seeing as how it was shamelessly complicit in publishing it.

Hammond in a full breakdown of Carroll’s junk science article that was published by the World Mercury Project, actually revealed that the supposed benefits of the flu shot are basically nil. The second arrived at similar conclusions, explaining rather clearly that there is “no evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission of complications.”

But Carroll obviously came to his own private conclusions when declaring that flu shots provide “a big payoff in public health.” Besides completely misconstruing of the actual numbers that were published in both studies, revealing that he likely didn’t even read them, Carroll proceeded to cherry pick only the pieces of out-of-context data that suited his agenda, publishing his own declarations about what the studies purportedly found.

“… it is curious why Carroll would cite the estimated effectiveness of the vaccine ‘under ideal conditions’ – which is to say when the vaccine completely matches the circulating virus – in order to support his argument that it’s worth getting even in poorly matched years,” Hammond points out in his damning critique.

“Why didn’t he instead cite the study’s more relevant estimate of vaccine effectiveness under ‘average conditions,’ when the vaccine only partially matches the circulating strains? … The most obvious answer is that relaying the review’s finding that ‘100 people need to be vaccinated to avoid one set of influenza symptoms’ would be counterproductive to his purpose.”

It’s the same type of thing that VICE recently did with its publishing of an article claiming that science has concluded that everyone is secretly bisexual. In this particular case, VICE cited a study that actually only found that lesbian women are attracted to other women, but contorted this matter-of-fact “discovery” to claim that everyone falls somewhere on a “sexuality spectrum,” and nobody is actually “straight.”

This is the question many people are now asking after a recent study conducted by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh (UP) in Pennsylvania revealed that many of the infant monkeys given standard doses of childhood vaccines as part of the new research developed autism symptoms.

For their analysis, Laura Hewitson and her colleagues at UP conducted the type of proper safety research on typical childhood vaccination schedules that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) should have conducted — but never has — for such regimens. And what this brave team discovered was groundbreaking, as it completely deconstructs the mainstream myth that vaccines are safe and pose no risk of autism.

Presented at the International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR) in London, England, the findings revealed that young macaque monkeys given the typical CDC-recommended vaccination schedule from the 1990s, and in appropriate doses for the monkeys’ sizes and ages, tended to develop autism symptoms. Their unvaccinated counterparts, on the other hand, developed no such symptoms, which points to a strong connection between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders.

Included in the mix were several vaccines containing the toxic additive Thimerosal, a mercury-based compound that has been phased out of some vaccines, but is still present in batch-size influenza vaccines and a few others. Also administered was the controversial measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been linked time and time again to causing autism and various other serious, and often irreversible, health problems in children (http://www.greenhealthwatch.com)

“This research underscores the critical need for more investigation into immunizations, mercury, and the alterations seen in autistic children,” said Lyn Redwood, director of SafeMinds, a public safety group working to expose the truth about vaccines and autism. “SafeMinds calls for large scale, unbiased studies that look at autism medical conditions and the effects of vaccines given as a regimen.”

Vaccine oversight needs to be taken from CDC and given to independent agency, says vaccine safety advocate

Adding to the sentiment, Theresa Wrangham, president of SafeMinds called out the CDC for failing to require proper safety studies of its recommended vaccination schedules. Unlike all other drugs, which must at least undergo a basic round of safety testing prior to approval and recommendation, vaccinations and vaccine schedules in particular do not have to be proven safe or effective before hitting the market.

“The full implications of this primate study await publication of the research in a scientific journal,” said Wrangham. “But we can say that it demonstrates how the CDC evaded their responsibility to investigate vaccine safety questions. Vaccine safety oversight should be removed from the CDC and given to an independent agency.”

 Since we have been justified by faith,

 we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,

 through whom we have gained access by faith

 to this grace in which we stand,

 and we boast in hope of the glory of God. And hope does not disappoint,

 because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts

 through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

 For Christ, while we were still helpless,

 died at the appointed time for the ungodly.

 Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person,

 though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die.

 But God proves his love for us

 in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.

President Trump has declared today, Sunday, March 15, 2020, to be a National Day of Prayer. Here is his tweet:

It is my great honor to declare Sunday, March 15th as a National Day of Prayer. We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these. No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!

On Friday, March 13, President Trump also declared a national state of emergency due to the Wuhan coronavirus-induced respiratory illness, COVID-19.

In so doing, Trump has freed up to $50 billion in federal funding to federal, state and local governments attempting to combat COVID-19, as well as enabling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to mobilize personnel more quickly to help state and local agencies and leaders.

Trump also said and urged the following:
• The Department of Energy will buy up crude oil for storage in U.S. reserves.
• States should set up emergency operation centers and hospitals in accordance with active emergency preparedness plans.
• Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is given “broad new authority” allowing him to waive various laws and regulations related to hospital operations.
• U.S. government is partnering with private companies to increase Wuhan virus testing capabilities.
• Trump administration is working to set up drive-thru test sites. He met earlier in the day with lab and pharmacy executives to discuss the initiative.

Meanwhile, yesterday evening, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said President Trump has tested negative for COVID-19. Dr. Conley said in a press release:

Last night after an in-depth discussion with the President regrading COVID-19 testing, he elected to proceed. This evening I received confirmation that the test is negative. One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free. I have been in daily contact with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging the implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation.

Please pray for our President.

A document issued by the law and human rights ministry reviewed by Reuters stipulated that adult prisoners would be eligible for parole if they had served two-thirds of their sentences, while children would be eligible if they served half of their jail term.

Ministry spokesman Bambang Wiyono said on Tuesday the parole would encompass around 30,000 prisoners.

Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous nation and President Joko Widodo on Tuesday declared a national public health emergency in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak. So far, the government has reported 1,414 infections and 122 deaths from the virus, but some officials and experts believe a lack of testing has masked the scale of the outbreak.

Official data shows there are 270,386 prisoners across Indonesia, more than twice the official capacity of its jails, as a war on drugs has led to a surge in the number of people locked up. Many centers also lack proper sanitation, which makes inmates particularly vulnerable to the spread of diseases.

Erasmus Napitupulu, executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Reform (ICJR), welcomed the parole, but urged the government to widen it to include more prisoners.

Other countries including Iran and the United States have also released prisoners early in a bid to stem the accelerating spread of coronavirus in jails.

Widodo has said he would impose stricter rules on mobility and social distancing as a study presented to the government warned that more than 140,000 people could die from the coronavirus by May unless it takes tougher action."

Denninger says, “Since the crash in 2008, we’ve had 2% GDP expansion roughly on an average basis, and you are trying to expand the growth of one program in the government by 8.5%, and that’s not going to work. This is the problem you have. What Obamacare has done has caused the 2% expansion. . . . So, what has happened here is we have taken this program and crammed these costs into the economy on a mandated basis, and the result is the productivity expansion has gone into the toilet.”

Another big problem with Obamacare is the pre-existing conditions. Denninger says, “When you say an insurance company has to cover pre-existing conditions, what you are saying is if this condition costs $10,000, we are going to make it cost $12,000 because the insurance company has to make money. The cheapest way to pay for a condition that costs $10,000 is to write a check for $10,000. That’s just basic math, and yet nobody wants to deal with this. So, the high risk pools were in the process of collapsing, and as a result, you had Obamacare come into essentially force everybody into the risk pools. That was the whole point. Everybody has to buy health insurance and, therefore, force you to take things you cannot get. For example, as a man I, can never need maternity. . . . If you have these things that I have to pay for in my coverage, but the probability is zero of using it, then what you have done is stolen the money from me and given it to somebody else. . . . I don’t think this can be fixed at the present time.”

Denninger, a professional trader, says the financial markets look eerily like they did just before the “dot-com bust” (2000) and the financial meltdown of 2008. Denninger explains, “This is the same sort of situation we are in today. Nobody knows how long it will go on, but you are in a place right now with record margin debt in the United States. That’s very, very dangerous because at the point the margin calls start, the cascade is almost impossible to stop. You’ve got imbalances throughout the system. You’ve got the Federal Reserve where it has to start taking risk off the balance sheet. . . . We all know how this party is going to end. The building is going to catch on fire, and the door is one person wide, and there are 15,000 people in the room. The problem is figuring out how far it goes. At the point the market wakes up to the fact that none of this is going to get resolved at all—ever, that’s when it comes apart. . . . Risk/reward is in a bad place right now. P/E numbers are very high, and the growth numbers are very low”

Thanks to the selective “viewpoint censorship” actively carried out by Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Wikipedia and even Vimeo, no independent, informed reporting on critical issues for our world — vaccine safety, 5G exposure, GMOs, pesticides, covid-19, etc. — has been allowed to earn the viewership it deserves.

Our own publishing platforms, for example, continue to experience over 99.5% traffic suppression due to the malicious censorship of the tech giants.

All that is about to change, thanks to President Trump’s executive order which threw down the gauntlet against Big Tech, declaring that the United States government will not tolerate tech platforms waging discrimination campaigns against particular viewpoints.

This means the lies of the corporate-controlled media — who absurdly claim that all vaccines are harmless, that GMOs are healthy, that 5G exposure is safe and that colloidal silver is toxic — will finally be challenged by the overwhelming weight of rational evidence that is being increasingly documented by independent media organizations like Natural News, Life Site News, The Epoch Times, The Highwire and so on.

Techno-fascists are in a state of panic over the thought of losing control over every narrative

The techno-fascists are in a panic, and they’re lashing out in the most malicious, punitive tactics we’ve seen yet. Facebook, for example, has blacklisted the sharing of all videos from Brighteon.com, a free speech video platform, effectively banning all videos from being shared. This includes videos from Chinese human rights pioneer Jennifer Zeng, who was tortured in a communist Chinese prison. Facebook’s banning of her videos no doubt pleases the CCP and Zuckerborg alike. Facebook is also banning videos about pet care, home gardening, prenatal nutrition and meditation.

Facebook and the fake news media have also unleashed a new wave of malicious fake news attacks to try to discredit independent media publishers ahead of changes to Sec. 230 that would give independent publishers a more level playing field to debate important ideas for human society. Now, instead of merely characterizing independent media as “fake news,” the mainstream media is claiming that any publisher who questions the fraudulent vaccine industry or the aggressive push for 5G is suddenly a “troll farm.”

What’s clear is that the narrative monopolists — the corporate news giants working in coordination with the techno-fascists — are for the first time facing the very real possibility that they will no longer be able to monopolize every debate and censor every view they want to crush. If President Trump’s efforts succeed at tearing down Sec. 230 protections for the techno-fascists, for the first time since the dawn of the internet, the corporate-controlled fake news media would be forced to start defending their deceptive fake news claims rather than relying on censorship and coordinated media smears to silence opposing views.

Despite this, some report that they still beat themselves up or otherwise struggle to work through guilt, shame or regret about not doing what Jesus said to do or “making the same stupid mistakes over and over."" They feel rejected by God for these failures even though they've been diligently ""seeking the Kingdom first"" more than ever before (Mt 6:33). If this sounds like you, you probably have not yet learned how to ""apply the blood of Christ""—perhaps the most important habit for staying connected to God. You're not alone as it took Tim and Katrina decades to discover and establish this important healthy habit and quickly deal with bad feelings. After we conclude the podcast, stay tuned for a ""post-credits"" segment we recorded immediately after because Katrina got a new insight that explains Revelation 12:11 literally (before Tim ever did!). In other words, by learning and practicing the wisdom in this teaching, you personally will be part of an end time prophecy fulfillment!

Upon listening to the podcast, Katrina commented:

We really nailed a lot of stuff that people think inside but usually don’t have words to express. Also, VERY IMPORTANT note: the Scripture I quoted about what Paul said in 1 Cor 11 is directly talking about applying the blood in an unworthy manner in relation to how you treat the collective body of believers. I know this and please do not send me messages that I misused this Scripture (saying this even before this podcast is posted). I am merely pointing out that there is more than one way, not just how you treat others, to try to drink the wine and eat the bread that brings condemnation on yourself instead of freedom.

“Information about the usage of chemical weapons by [Syrian President Bashar] Assad is fabricated in the same way as the lie about [Saddam] Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction [in Iraq],” Alexei Pushkov, head of the Russian lower house of parliament’s international affairs committee, said on Twitter.

US intelligence reports presented to the UN and the international community prior to the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 claimed Saddam Hussein’s regime possessed weapons of mass destruction including nerve agents, ballistic missiles and a nuclear weapons program. The US claimed the threat posed by those weapons justified the invasion of Iraq, but after the country was occupied, the alleged weapons of mass destruction were never found.

Former Vice President and 2020 contender Joe Biden was forced to shed light on his contradictory accounts on his role in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Biden previously said he advised President Barack Obama not to execute the operation.

But on Friday, Biden told a reporter this was not true, which conflicted the accounts by several other top Obama officials.

The comment came from what appeared to be an interview in which Fox News' Peter Doocey in where Biden was and about he U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

Doocey asked Biden if he would ""pull the trigger"" to take out a terror leader if he had intelligence that could prevent an attack against Americans.

But Biden responded by bringing up bin Laden:

""Well, we did, the guy’s name is Osama bin Laden,"" he said before Doocey implied that the then Vice President told Obama not to do it.

Biden's description of his stance of the decision-making method behind the raid on bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, has morphed over the years.

In 2012, he said his advice was ""don’t go.""

But by 2015, he said he had privately told Obama to ""go.""

Biden's version of events contradicts the public accounts of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama, former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, and former CIA Director Leon Panetta.

“I respected Bob [Gates] and Joe [Biden]'s concerns about the risks of a raid, but I came to the conclusion that the intelligence was convincing, and the risks were outweighed by the benefits of success.”

Gates and Panetta also claimed Biden opposed the operation:

“I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades,"" Gates said of Biden.

Obama made it clear that Biden had opposed the raid during a presidential debate with Mitt Romney on Oct. 22, 2012.

The former President told Romney that “even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.”

Pelosi speaking to reporters over the weekend admitted there would be “collateral damage for those who don’t share our view.”

And then to underscore her disdain for those industries that have rebounded under the Trump Economy, she blew off their future economic suffering stating… “so be it!”

The remark came as Pelosi discussed the issue of climate change with New York Times columnist and economist Paul Krugman — she apparently went off script during a sweeping discussion regarding our booming economy and its effect on climate change.

Pelosi exhibiting a moment (the first within her political career) of truthfulness, acknowledged that she would push for progressive policies that would in effect produce “collateral damage for some others who do not share our view.”

Perhaps realizing she had been too candid too close to the midterms, she attempted to walk back her statement.

“We owe the American people to be there for them, for their financial security, respecting the dignity and worth of every person in our country, and if there is some collateral damage for some others who do not share our view, well, so be it, but it shouldn’t be our original purpose.”

Krugman seemed momentary taken-back by Pelosi’s remarks and attempted to give the 78-year old lawmaker some cover, asking the San Francisco Senator if she could find common ground with her Republican counterparts.

Although Pelosi refrained from naming the industries, she would target, it’s overwhelmingly clear that Democrats have the energy industry within their crosshairs, specifically the coal industry.

No doubt if the unthinkable should happen and the Democrats take control of either chamber, look for the radical element of the Party (roughly 99.9%), to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump, followed by an attempt to unseat Justice Brett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court, and an attempt to quash any and all investigations regarding the malfeasance committed by top FBI and DOJ officials, before, during and after the 2016 election, and finally attempting to once again impose massive restrictions and mandates on a variety of industries, especially those industries within coal-producing states, that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump.

A Democratic win would also invigorate the radical left to continue intimidating, threatening and bullying both Republican legislators and Trump supporters.

Also look for a Democratically controlled House to once again attempt to resurrect the Obama era “clean air” policies of cutting greenhouse gas emission, that would gut millions of new jobs just created by President Trump, increase energy costs for fixed-income seniors (possibly pushing them into poverty), and place a disproportionate amount of the burden on coal-producing communities, namely “red states.”

This may be the Democratic strategy for the 2020 Presidential Election, crippling the surging economy with the help of an accommodating media, Democrats hope to blame President Trump and Republicans by attempting to discredit him as a reckless, incompetent outsider… their strategy almost worked with the bogus Russian collusion hoax, why not with the economy?"

They committed an enormous global crime and only paid a fine. JP Morgan, Barclays, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS will pay $5.8 billion in penalties for rigging the $5.3 trillion a day currency market. Once again, nobody will go to jail, even though all these big banks plead guilty to criminal charges for rigging the Forex market. UBS received immunity from criminal prosecution because it blew the whistle on the crime. I did not know a bank can be a criminal and the humans running it be exempt from charges. This means the masterminds will pay nothing, and the fines will be paid by shareholders. Why should you care? This is a sign that the system is extremely weak and is being propped up by pure fraud and manipulation. My friend Gregory Mannarino says that the $5.8 billion fine is nothing and is the cost of doing business. Mannarino told me this is just a show to make people think the system is safe and regulated and points out, “There is a need to keep confidence in the financial system.” Mannarino says if the fine was nearly $6 billion, how do you know the bankers didn’t make $600 billion in this fraud.” Again, nobody at the banks goes to jail and shareholders pay the fines.

Guess what? UBS is a whistleblower in a new case coming up, and this time, it involves some of the same big banks and price rigging in the precious metals market. That’s right, gold and silver prices are being rigged, and the Justice Department is probably going to fine some more bankers. Might I remind you that several big banks paid fines after admitting to rigging the LIBOR interest rate markets. Hundreds of trillions of dollars in interest rates are set off LIBOR. Let’s see, interest rates have been rigged, currency markets have been rigged and precious metals markets are being rigged. Are you getting the picture of how dire it must be that all markets are rigged in some way? This past week, Rob Kirby said, “The markets are a crime scene.” This is not an exaggeration. There is proof in terms of fines, penalties and widely reported cases that all markets are rigged in some way, and governments will not jail any of these bankers! Not a single big name banker has gone to jail for massive global fraud. What could go wrong?

In the latest “there is no recovery” news, look no further than the Federal Reserve. In last month’s Fed meeting, policymakers said they would not raise interest rates in June. According to USA Today, it is because of “the economy’s recent sluggish performance.” There is NO RECOVERY and the Fed knows it.

It looks like a crisis has been averted off the coast of Yemen. Iran has agreed to UN inspections of a cargo ship carrying humanitarian aid to Yemen. Iraq is not that lucky. Ramadi has fallen to ISIS. So has the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria. With these defeats, ISIS get new equipment and tanks as they are abandoned by retreating Iraq forces. The US policy in Iraq is turning into a disaster, and, yet, the Presidents top priority is “climate change,” also known as “global warming.” That is the top “security threat.”

We also found out this week that there is major cooperation between Iran and al-Qaeda. Of course, ISIS is an even more radical offshoot of al-Qaeda. You would never know that if you only listened to the mainstream media such as USA Today. Their front page headline about new information gathered in the Bin Laden raid talks of “Love letters.” The headline should read “Bin Laden Intel Shows Iran and al-Qaeda Working Together for Years.”

Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, also known as Haji Iman and Abu Alaa al-Afri, was a veteran with a bounty of $7 million on his head.

That was second only to the $10 million offered for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and accurately reflected his importance to the group.

""This is the heaviest blow to ISIS in terms of assassinations because Qaduli was at the heart of (its) ...administrative structure,"" said Hisham al-Hashimi, an analyst who advises the Iraqi government on the militants. ""Baghdadi can't replace Haji Iman with a person of equivalent value. He will have to appoint three people to fill the vacuum... That reduces (Baghdadi's)... efficiency and leaves him more exposed to danger than before.""

As well as heading the Shura council that advises Baghdadi, Qaduli was governor of the Syrian provinces and the group's financial comptroller, Hashimi said.

His death, and just before him that of war minister Abu Omar al-Shishani and the capture of an unidentified chemical weapons operative, ""show that the United States has sources of information close to their top command level,"" the analyst added.

U.S. officials say ISIS is losing a battle to forces arrayed against it from many sides in the vast region it controls. The fighters were on the retreat this week in the strategic Syrian city of Palmyra.

In Iraq, the group has been pulling back since December when it lost Ramadi, the capital of the western province of Anbar. The Baghdad government is hoping this year to recapture Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq, seized by the militants nearly two years ago.

""The loss of Haji Iman will be massive. Although (ISIS) ... has a strong system in place to replace key leaders it still takes time to readjust,"" said Ranj Talabany, an official from the Kurdish Zanyari intelligence agency.

""He was fully aware of their finances, and key leadership decisions were made with Haji Iman being consulted.""

Unlike many ISIS commanders, Qaduli came from Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda rather than the dissolved Baath party of Saddam Hussein, who was toppled by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003.

He was arrested several times under Saddam because of his extremist religions opinions and went to Afghanistan in 1998, where he met bin Laden, Hashimi said.

Bin Laden wanted him to take over command of the group's Iraq franchise in 2010. But Baghdadi, already settled in as the local commander, turned against al Qaeda in 2013 and declared himself caliph a year later, winning the backing of Qaduli, Hashimi said.

""He is considered the group's top civilian administrator,"" he added, with duties under Baghdadi including the deportation of religious and ethnic minorities and the organized rape of Yazidi women.

The commander expected to replace Qaduli as Syria governor is the group's spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, who has a $5 million bounty on his head, Hashimi said.

Its likely new financial comptroller is Iyad al-Obaidi, also known as Fadel Haifa, a security officer under Saddam who took over the role of war minister after Shishani was killed, according to Hashimi.

Abdallah al-Khatouni, the group's head of justice, may become chairman of the Shura council, he added.

U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Friday said Qaduli was likely killed this week in an offensive targeting ISIS's financial operations.

Carter said Qaduli had played a role in recruiting foreign fighters, but could not confirm he had anything to do with Tuesday's bombings in Brussels.

U.S. Army Col. Steve Warren, Baghdad-based spokesman for an international coalition battling ISIS, said Qaduli was also providing finances and counsel on launching attacks in the West, adding: ""He had been an international terrorist for more than a decade. His experience and knowledge will be missed by (ISIS)."""

Michael Flynn, the Saudis, Bibi Netanyahu, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker as actors involved in the situation with Iran.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by President Trump, Gen. Michael Flynn, the Saudis, and Iran, such as making threats, testing missiles, and engaging in military action.",True,The article mentions threats made by President Trump and Gen. Michael Flynn towards Iran.,False,There is no mention of patterns in this article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in this article.,"Americans do not want another war. So why did President Donald Trump make the mistake of drawing a line in the sand in regard to Iran’s legal missile test? Will this turn into the same humiliation that President Obama suffered after threatening Syria, or is this the start of provocations that will lead to a disastrous war with Iran?

When Gen. Michael Flynn marched into the White House Briefing Room to declare that “we are officially putting Iran on notice,” he drew a red line for President Trump. In tweeting the threat, Trump agreed. His credibility is now on the line. And what triggered this virtual ultimatum?

Iran-backed Houthi rebels, said Flynn, attacked a Saudi warship and Tehran tested a missile, undermining “security, prosperity, and stability throughout the Middle East,” placing “American lives at risk.”

But how so?

The Saudis have been bombing the Houthi rebels and ravaging their country, Yemen, for two years. Are the Saudis entitled to immunity from retaliation in wars that they start?

Where is the evidence Iran had a role in the Red Sea attack on the Saudi ship? And why would President Trump make this war his war?

As for the Iranian missile test, a 2015 UN resolution “called upon” Iran not to test nuclear-capable missiles. It did not forbid Iran from testing conventional missiles, which Tehran insists this was.

Bug Out While You Still Can! Learn More…

Is the United States making new demands on Iran not written into the nuclear treaty or international law—to provoke a confrontation?

Did Flynn coordinate with our allies about this warning of possible military action against Iran? Is NATO obligated to join any action we might take?

Or are we going to carry out any retaliation alone, as our NATO allies observe, while the Israelis, Gulf Arabs, Saudis, and the Beltway War Party, which wishes to be rid of Trump, cheer him on?

Bibi Netanyahu hailed Flynn’s statement, calling Iran’s missile test a flagrant violation of the UN resolution and declaring, “Iranian aggression must not go unanswered.” By whom, besides us?

The Saudi king spoke with Trump Sunday. Did he persuade the president to get America more engaged against Iran?

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker is among those delighted with the White House warning:

“No longer will Iran be given a pass for its repeated ballistic missile violations, continued support of terrorism, human rights abuses, and other hostile activities that threaten international peace and security.”

The problem with making a threat public—Iran is “on notice”—is that it makes it almost impossible for Iran, or Trump, to back away.

Tehran seems almost obliged to defy it, especially the demand that it cease testing conventional missiles for its own defense.

This U.S. threat will surely strengthen those Iranians opposed to the nuclear deal and who wish to see its architects, President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, thrown out in this year’s elections.

If Rex Tillerson is not to become a wartime secretary of state like Colin Powell or Dean Rusk, he is going to have to speak to the Iranians, not with defiant declarations, but in a diplomatic dialogue.

Tillerson, of course, is on record as saying the Chinese should be blocked from visiting the half-dozen fortified islets they have built on rocks and reefs in the South China Sea.

A prediction: The Chinese will not be departing from their islands, and the Iranians will defy the U.S. threat against testing their missiles.

Wednesday’s White House statement makes a collision with Iran almost unavoidable, and a war with Iran quite possible.

Why did Trump and Flynn feel the need to do this now?

There is an awful lot already on the foreign policy plate of the new president after only two weeks, as pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine are firing artillery again and North Korea’s nuclear missile threat, which, unlike Iran’s, is real, has yet to be addressed.

High among the reasons that many supported Trump was his understanding that George W. Bush blundered horribly in launching an unprovoked and unnecessary war on Iraq.

Along with the 15-year war in Afghanistan and our wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, our 21st-century U.S. Mideast wars have cost us trillions of dollars and thousands of dead. And they have produced a harvest of hatred of America that was exploited by al Qaida and ISIS to recruit jihadists to murder and massacre Westerners.

Osama bin Laden’s greatest achievement was not to bring down the twin towers and kill 3,000 Americans, but to goad America into plunging headlong into the Middle East, a reckless and ruinous adventure that ended her post-Cold War global primacy.

Unlike the other candidates, Trump seemed to recognize this.

It was thought he would disengage us from these wars, not rattle a saber at an Iran that is three times the size of Iraq and has as its primary weapons supplier and partner Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

When Barack Obama drew his red line against Bashar Assad’s use of chemical weapons in Syria’s civil war, and Assad appeared to cross it, Obama discovered that his countrymen wanted no part of the war that his military action might bring on.

Neither the Ayatollah Khamenei nor Trump appears to be in a mood to back away, especially now that the president has made the threat public.

63,True,The article suggests that Bill Gates is intentionally promoting lockdowns and quarantine measures to prevent natural immunity and sell pharmaceuticals and vaccines.,True,Bill Gates is explicitly mentioned as the actor responsible for promoting lockdowns and quarantine measures.,True,The article states that Bill Gates is promoting lockdowns and quarantine measures to stop people from naturally catching the virus.,True,The article suggests that the lockdowns and quarantine measures are a threat to people's natural immunity and freedom of movement.,True,The article connects events and statements made by Bill Gates to support the conspiracy theory.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"Bill Gates: coronavirus lockdowns will prevent people from developing natural immunity so we can sell them more drugs, vaccines

On March 24, Bill Gates had a digital talk with Chris Anderson, Curator of TED, the nonprofit group that runs TED Talks, during which he gave his take on the handling of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. And during their conversation, Gates admitted that the purpose of these extreme lockdown and quarantine measures is to stop people from naturally catching the virus so that people like Gates can sell them more pharmaceuticals and vaccines later on down the road.

About halfway through their talk, Gates stated that “we don’t want to have a lot of recovered people” from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). Instead, the goal is “to not get to one percent of the population infected,” Gates stated, because he’d rather the general population be forced into first getting tested, then vaccinated, for this novel virus.

“To be clear, we’re trying – through the shut-down in the United States – to not get to one percent of the population infected,” Gates is quoted as saying. “We’re well below that today, but with exponentiation, you could get past that three million [people or approximately one percent of the U.S. population being infected with COVID-19 and the vast majority recovery].”

“I believe we will be able to avoid that with having this economic pain.”

In other words, Gates and whomever else he’s colluding with to make things as difficult as possible for the American people through this crisis are intentionally doing this in preparation for the rollout of their “solution,” which will involve selling the public billions of dollars’ worth of new antiviral drugs and vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“Eventually what we’ll have to have is certificates of who’s a recovered person, who’s a vaccinated person,” Gates went on to explain. “Because you don’t want people moving around the world where you’ll have some countries that won’t have it under control, sadly.”

“You don’t want to completely block off the ability for people to go there and come back and move around,” he added. “So eventually there will be this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening up.”

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how people like Bill Gates who are pushing vaccines as the solution to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are nothing but quacks:

If people want to return to “normal,” they’ll have to get jabbed by Bill Gates

If all goes according to plan, Gates plans to hold the world hostage until everyone – or at least everyone who wants to return back to a “normal” way of living – agrees to whatever he declares as the “remedy” for this coronavirus, which he’s already indicated will include mandatory vaccination.

As we reported the other day, the vaccines that Gates is planning to introduce will come with so-called quantum dot tattoos, a type of small microchip that will have to be inserted underneath the skin in order to function.

Much like – if not the embodiment of – the Mark of the Beat spoken about in the book of Revelation, Gates’ digital microchip vaccinations will be required for all people who want to open back up their businesses and participate in society. They’ll also likely store the “digital dollar” cryptocurrency that was included as part of the stimulus bill recently signed by President Trump.

What’s truly amazing about all of this is that people like Gates aren’t even trying to hide their true intentions anymore. The general public is apparently so distracted, disinterested or just plain dumb that the truth being laid out right in front of their faces isn’t motivating enough to get them to rise up against it.

It’s a full-on war against humanity, and Gates himself described it as such during another TED Talks event he spoke at several years back before a live audience. Gates warned about a future pandemic, comparing it to a weapon of war for the new world.

“Today, the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn’t look like this,” Gates stated, pointing to an image of an atomic bomb explosion. “Instead, it looks like this,” he added, pointing to another image of a virus, which closely resembles the digital imagery of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that’s being attached to many of today’s news articles.

In other words, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was predicted long ago by Bill Gates, and likened to a wartime weapon, suggesting that it was intentionally unleashed for such a time as this in order to force people into quarantine, and eventually force them to be vaccinated in order to be let out of quarantine.

“If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war,” Gates went on to admit. “Not missiles, but microbes.”

And trees can't even enjoy the benefits of Wi-Fi. It's all very unjust.

The study, conducted by Wageningen University, investigated findings that trees in areas with high Wi-Fi activity (urban areas, especially) were suffering from symptoms that couldn't be tied to typical bacterial or viral causes. The symptoms included bleeding (!), fissures in the bark, the death of parts of leaves, and abnormal growth.

To test the hypothesis that the mystery illness was caused by radiation poisoning, the researchers took 20 ash trees and exposed them to various kinds of radiation for three months. Sure enough, the ash trees exposed to Wi-Fi signals showed telltale signs of radiation sickness, including a ""lead-like shine"" on their leaves, indicating the oncoming death of those leaves. In the Netherlands, a whopping 70% of urban trees are suffering from radiation poisoning, up from only 10% five years ago–understandable, considering the explosion in Wi-Fi use in the past five years.

Of course, trees in rural or even simply non-urban environments are pretty much unaffected, but theoretically, all deciduous trees in the Western world could be affected.

The researchers are planning several more studies to figure out the precise effects of radiation on plant life. In the meantime, they don't really offer any preliminary solutions, but I'm sure they'd approve of wrapping every urban tree you see in tin foil, root to leaf. (Note: Wrapping public trees in tin foil may be illegal in your city, state, arrondissement, or prefecture. PopSci cannot be held responsible if you are arrested for such activities.)"
65,True,The article discusses a strategy of mass censorship by the pharmaceutical industry and its supporters to suppress information about vaccines that is not aligned with their interests.,True,The article mentions Congressman Adam Schiff as the leading figure who is using his power and influence to strengthen censorship efforts.,True,"The article describes the actions taken by Congressman Adam Schiff to contact Google, Facebook, and Amazon to de-platform or discredit information on vaccines that he deemed inaccurate.",False,The article does not mention any specific threats resulting from the actions described.,True,The article connects various events and actions to highlight the alleged strategy of mass censorship by the pharmaceutical industry and its supporters.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"The growing vaccine hesitancy has led the pharmaceutical industry and its supporters to a dangerous strategy: mass censorship.

For those of you who haven’t heard, politicians and social media outlets are taking action steps to censor information about vaccines that is not aligned with the industry and its regulatory ‘arm,’ the CDC.

In other words, just about anyone who is even questioning vaccine safety, let alone providing evidence that vaccines are not safe, is liable to be discredited, de-monitized, or de-platformed from social media.

Leading the charge is Congressman Adam Schiff, an advocate of vaccine safety and friend of the pharmaceutical industry, who has used his power and influence to immediately strengthen censorship efforts. His moves have been seen as unfair, unethical, and even illegal.

In fact, on Jan 15, 2020, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, along with Katarina Verrelli, on behalf of herself and others who seek access to vaccine information, filed suit against Adam Schiff in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Schiff has abused government power and infringed on their free-speech rights.

Here’s how the association characterizes the situation:

“Who appointed Congressman Adam Schiff as Censor-in-Chief?” asks AAPS General Counsel. “No one did, and he should not be misusing his position to censor speech on the internet.”

In February and March 2019, Rep. Schiff contacted Google, Facebook, and Amazon, to encourage them to de-platform or discredit what Schiff asserted to be inaccurate information on vaccines. He then posted the letters and press release on the House.gov website.

Within 24 hours of Schiff’s letter to Amazon dated Mar 1, 2019, Amazon removed the popular videos Vaxxed and Shoot ’Em Up: the Truth About Vaccines from its platform for streaming videos, depriving members of the public of convenient access.

Under a policy announced in May 2019, Twitter includes a pro-government disclaimer placed above search results for an AAPS article on vaccine mandates:

“Know the Facts. To make sure you get the best information on vaccination, resources are available from the US Department of Health and Human Services.”

The implication of this disclaimer is that if information is not on a government website, then it is somehow less credible.

On Facebook, a search for an AAPS article on vaccines, which previously would lead directly to the AAPS article, now produces search results containing links to the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Visits to the AAPS website have declined significantly since March 2019, both in absolute terms and relative to the decline that would result from a story’s losing its recency.

“The internet is supposed to provide free access to information to people of different opinions,” stated AAPS Executive Director, Jane Orient, M.D.

Dr. Orient continues, “AAPS is not ‘anti-vaccine,’ but rather supports informed consent, based on an understanding of the full range of medical, legal, and economic considerations relevant to vaccination and any other medical intervention, which inevitably involves risks as well as benefits.”

AAPS argues in the complaint against Rep. Schiff:

“The First Amendment protects the rights of free speech and association. Included within the right of free speech is a right to receive information from willing speakers. Under the First Amendment, Americans have the right to hear all sides of every issue and to make their own judgments about those issues without government interference or limitations. Content-based restrictions on speech are presumptively unconstitutional, and courts analyze such restrictions under strict scrutiny.”

The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is a national organization representing physicians in all specialties since 1943.

The terms “anti vax” and “pro vax” are really not serving in the best interest of the collective. All they do is divide people when in reality, all of us want the same thing, healthy children, and effective and safe medications if we are going to use them.

With all of the concerns that are still being made about vaccines, questioning vaccine safety should not be a problem and in fact, should be welcomed by everybody.

Forcing mandatory vaccination policy and censoring information on vaccines, in my opinion, seems to be quite tyrannical and immoral at this stage. I may have a different opinion if vaccines were 100 percent safe and effective for everybody, but they’re not."

“For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.” Galatians 3:26-28 (KJV)

The Bible emphatically declares that we can only be considered ‘children of God’ by faith in His Son, Jesus Christ. The reason for the new birth found in John 3:3 is because we are all created in the image of Adam since Genesis 5:3. Outside of the Body of Christ, there is no universal brotherhood of man from God’s perspective. But you cannot build a One World Church on such a narrow and exclusive doctrine as that, as Pope Francis is well aware. Please note the following that happened yesterday:

Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of 12 refugees Thursday at a migrant center in Castelnuovo di Porto outside of Rome, Italy. The ceremony took place as part of the observances of Maundy Thursday, the Holy Thursday before Easter that dates back to the story of Jesus’ Last Supper.

In a powerful gesture of interfaith embrace, the pontiff knelt down before a group of eight men and four women, among whom were Muslims, Coptic Christians and one Hindu.

“All of us together: Muslims, Hindus, Catholics, Copts, Evangelicals … all brothers and children of the same God,” the pontiff said during a Mass before the foot washing ceremony. “We want to live together in peace.”

Islam rejects Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and reduces Him to the level of a mere prophet, like Mohammed. Neither do Hindus recognize Jesus Christ as the appointed Messiah to Israel. Because of that, God does not consider Muslims or Hindus to be His children because they reject the sin payment Jesus made on the cross.

“Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” John 3:3 (KJV)

If Pope Francis really loved the Muslims and Hindus, if he really wanted to show them true compassion, he would open up a King James Bible and show them how to get saved and become born again. But the pope never tells anyone how to get saved, he never tells them of their need to become born again.

“And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.” Revelation 18:16,24 (KJV)

Pope Francis is the king of Vatican City, the Roman Catholic Whore of Babylon, who has the blood of countless millions on his filthy hands. He washed and kissed their feet, and never once told them how to get saved. That is the work of Antichrist."

Officially, there are currently 69,289 confirmed cases, and 1,670 fatalities, with 95% of those coming from China.

To that end, Barron’s notes that China’s coronavirus numbers are “too perfect to mean much.”

A statistical analysis of China’s coronavirus casualty data shows a near-perfect prediction model that data analysts say isn’t likely to naturally occur, casting doubt over the reliability of the numbers being reported to the World Health Organization. That’s aside from news on Thursday that health officials in the epicenter of the outbreak reported a surge in new infections after changing how they diagnose the illness. -Barron’s

This week, the Trump administration said that it does “not have high confidence in the information coming out of China,” while CNBC notes that Beijing has been reluctant to accept help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and has been suppressing information about the outbreak from scientists that run counter to their prevailing narrative that everything is under control and the virus is peaking.

U.S. officials’ mistrust of China goes as far back as the 1950s, when national authorities set unrealistic production quotas that led local officials to inflate data. Mishaps with the 2003 outbreak of SARS, which sickened 8,098 people and killed about 800 over nine months, and discrepancies in reporting of economic data over the past two decades has only hardened the U.S. government’s belief that China cannot be trusted, experts say. White House advisor Peter Navarro has even called China a “disease incubator.” -CNBC

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) – which receives the second-largest financial contribution from China after the United States – has been defending Beijing and praising their response while insisting that travel restrictions are unnecessary and racist (would spread “fear and stigma”).

“This is a very obviously tense political environment because of the economic issues and because of everything else,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies program while speaking from Geneva. “Please, let our scientists get on. Let our public health professionals get on. Let them work together.”

“This is the time for facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumors. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last month.

The facts, Tedros, is that an unknown number of Chinese citizens are sick and dying the largest quarantine in human history, of a virus which can be contracted by asymptotic “super spreaders,” and which has now begun to spread around the world.

This video contains an extraordinary conversation for extraordinary times. Biblical times, really. When the lie becomes the truth and the truth becomes a lie. These days, lying is not just okey dokey, nor is it an occasional little white one – there’s no such thing. It is not merely the flavor for the month. It is all of the above, and so much more. It’s the new American tradition. Now it’s politically correct to remove Native American names from sports teams. Don’t talk about small pox blankets and decimating buffalo from the windows of steam engine trains. Just remove a word, no worries. No harm done. Withholding evidence is also a lie. Change the message, bury the truth. Like around fourteen years ago, when men and women destroyed the evidence of Merck’s MMR vaccine showing a causal relationship with autism, with increased risk reserved for African American male children. Corrupted souls filled with fraud, deception, flat out lying to Congress and themselves did not have the mindset of “do no harm.” CDC scientists destroyed the proof that children injected with the MMR vaccine could very well have a full cognitive life taken from them via autism. If truth were told, their profits and brotherhood would suffer, so, no worries, just destroy the evidence and go on your merry way. Change a word or two. Allow another slaughter of the innocent begin. And when the truth starts to trickle out it is ignored, suppressed or mocked. But the truth cannot be contained. Here’s an except from the Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s interview with Alex Jones:

Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary ""sulforaphane"" and ""glucosinolate"" nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.

“I’m twenty years into this battle, and it could have continued the way it was going, until one man stepped forward, [William Thompson] a senior scientist, a CDC insider saying, “I was in charge of a study where we tested a hypotheses and we found the MMR vaccination was causally associated with autism and we hid the findings. We hid it for fourteen years and we have know for fourteen years that this vaccine is causally associated with autism and we have concealed it. We’ve put millions of Americas children in harms way and I can live with that no longer.”

It’s a note of hope that a man no longer can live with his lie. So he turns away and walks a new direction. That’s called repentance. America must follow suite.

You must see the movie VAXXED and spread the truth

Andrew Wakefield, made the film featuring William Thompson, a former CDC senior scientist turned whistleblower. Thompson has provided the world 100% proof that even the then top dog of the CDC, Judy Gerberding, M.D., knew Merck’s MMR vaccine would harm children. Back in 2004, Ms. Gerberding was too busy vying for her new revolving door job as President of the Vaccine Division of Merck. Call those revolving doors kickbacks, bribery or sociopathic fascism, whatever the monogram, autism has skyrocketed, parents are grieving and our nation is killing it’s young, not just the 60 million in the womb, but the infants who are born healthy, have a vaccination and never speak again.

Lying has taken on a life of its own. America, Lies are U.S.

It’s imperative to share this interview. Another part of the discussion mentions neonatal nurses who have been tasked with giving underweight infants vaccinations. And when that happens, these children die.

The proof, and the truth about food, fluoride, Big Pharma, Fukushima, birth certificate bond trust documents, banking and the march toward NWO is out there. Find it and be set free."

In fact, the co-founder of Greenpeace Canada, Patrick Moore, recently spilled the beans during an interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight, explaining that not only is global warming completely fake, but that it’s also being used by social engineers around the world – including Greenpeace – to fear-monger the public in to giving up their rights and freedoms.

Speaking with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak, Moore held nothing back in revealing fear and guilt are being used as conversion tactics to draw more followers into the Cult of Climate Change – the endgame being to siphon as much cash from people as possible in order to implement a globalist system of governance in which nobody will be allowed to drive big cars, eat meat, use plastic, or in any other way “harm” the planet.

“Fear has been used all through history to gain control of people’s minds and wallets and all else, and the climate catastrophe is strictly a fear campaign – well, fear and guilt – you’re afraid you’re killing your children because you’re driving them in your SUV and emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and you feel guilty for doing that,” Moore explained during his interview.

“There’s no stronger motivation than those two.”

“Green” companies are also a propaganda-driven fraud, Moore says

But what about all of the climate “scientists” who’ve reached a “consensus” that the earth is heating up because of cow farts, you might be asking? According to Moore, the whole thing is a faux-science racket driven by corrupt politicians and bureaucracies that are trying to centralize more political power and control, and that couldn’t care less about the environment.

It’s the same situation with so-called “green” companies, which are also fraudulent in that they’re simply mechanisms of deception designed to steal more taxpayer funds and funnel them into pet projects that never actually go anywhere.

Americans witnessed this under the Obama regime, when about $80 billion in “green” energy “stimulus” money was basically flushed down the toilet after it was learned that nearly 50 of the “green” energy companies that Obama subsidized on the taxpayer dime ultimately went belly-up.

The unholy trifecta of the “green movement,” the fake media, and corrupt politicians continue to drive the conspiracy theory of global warming and climate change, despite not having a shred of legitimate evidence or proof that these mythical concepts even exist – and the brainwashed masses just continue to gobble it all up.

“… you’ve got the green movement creating stories that instill fear in the public. You’ve got the media echo chamber – fake news – repeating it over and over and over again to everybody that they’re killing their children. And then you’ve got the green politicians who are buying scientists with government money to produce fear for them in the form of scientific-looking materials,” Moore says.

“And then you’ve got the green businesses, the rent-seekers, and the crony capitalists who are taking advantage of massive subsidies, huge tax write-offs, and government mandates requiring their technologies to make a fortune on this. And then, of course, you’ve got the scientists who are willingly, they’re basically hooked on government grants.”

The Democratic Party has clamped down on its only anti-war presidential candidate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (DHawaii). In an attempt to trim the countless numbers of presidential aspirants, the party issued a decree that to continue to participate in the next round of debates, a candidate had to have achieved a rating of 2% or higher in at least four polls approved by the Democratic National Committee (DNC). While Gabbard has exceeded 2% in 26 national and state polls, including those run by establishment outlets like The Economist and the Boston Globe, only two of them are on the DNC’s “certified” list. Journalist Michael Tracey of “RealClearPolitics.com” wrote, “Tulsi Gabbard is on the verge of being excluded from the next Democratic presidential debate on the basis of criteria that appear increasingly absurd.”

Gabbard memorably demolished establishment favorite Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) in an earlier presidential debate this year. While Harris’s support appears to have plummeted as a result of Gabbard taking her to task for her abysmal record as attorney general of California, the feisty populist hasn’t climbed in the unreliable, unnecessary, and prejudicial pre-election polls. In post-debate online polls, however, Gabbard has consistently shined, dominating all of her Democratic Party peers. Such a glaring dichotomy between Internet opinion and mainstream polls is curious, to say the least. It immediately evoked comparisons to the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign, when he crushed all opponents in every Internet poll and drew bigger crowds than all the other contenders combined yet wasn’t officially credited with a single primary win.

Gabbard has incurred the wrath of the liberal establishment with her populist stances. The hosts on the television talk show “The View” were openly antagonistic during her guest appearance, and comedian Stephen Colbert practically went apoplectic at her anti-war stance when she was on his show.

Gabbard has also introduced a bill to audit the Federal Reserve, is outspoken about the deadly GMO food products, came out strongly for civil liberties and the free speech of those she disagrees with during one debate, and has been the only high-profile politician to speak out publicly in support of hounded whistleblowers Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.

Considering the in-your-face corruption from the 2016 presidential campaign, revealed by WikiLeaks, that exposed a glaring effort to rig the primaries for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, one would think that the Democrats would be a bit more circumspect this time. The Democrats did everything they could to steal the nomination away from Sanders, who was drawing far bigger and more enthusiastic crowds than Clinton, even feeding her debate questions in advance, and utilizing the power of the ridiculous “Super Delegates” to give her a majority in many states where Sanders actually won the vote. The media bias for Clinton was so obvious that at one point, when Sanders had won eight primaries in a row, the mantra from virtually every “journalist” was that Hillary’s nomination was “inevitable.”

The presidential debates have long been used to exclude the rare outsider who attempts to attain the nation’s highest office. Ralph Nader was notably excluded from presidential debates, again for supposedly not reaching a certain threshold in “approved” polling. Pat Buchanan not only wasn’t permitted on stage when running as the Reform Party’s candidate in 2000, he was scorned and attacked by every pillar of the Republican Party establishment after pulling off a dramatic upset in the 1996 New Hampshire primary. Buchanan was cheated out of what seemed a clear win in Arizona; former Arizona Gov. Fife Symington actually phoned Buchanan’s state headquarters that afternoon and congratulated him on what the polls were showing to be a victory by a wide margin. While networks reported a huge Buchanan lead all throughout the day, suddenly Steve Forbes was said to be winning, with Bob Dole second and Buchanan lagging behind in third place. There were numerous irregularities, including the voters being permitted, for the first time in the state’s history, to vote in any precinct they wanted, and an incredible 60,000 voters receiving special “duplicate” ballots that allowed them to vote twice.

After the first Democratic Party presidential debate of 2019, the most googled name in the country was “Tulsi Gabbard.” After the second debate, Gabbard was at the top of Twitter’s “trending” list. Twitter simply removed her. Gabbard is now suing Google for $50 million. “Google’s discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over Internet search is. . . .,” Gabbard stated. “This is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans.”

Neither Buchanan nor Paul ever really publicly questioned the electoral fraud that derailed their presidential runs. Donald Trump notably did, even though he eventually won. Will Gabbard call out the rigged process?

It’s been a long and torrid journey for Dr. Ken Stoller who, as you may know, was targeted by the state of California for writing medical vaccine exemptions for some of his patients. And, sadly, the journey isn’t over yet.

In just a few short weeks, the Medical Board of California will be holding a hearing to examine a case against Dr. Stoller that accuses him of violating the newest laws in the Golden State governing when medical vaccine exemptions are appropriate.

At the time when Dr. Stoller wrote the 11 temporary and permanent exemptions from immunization that are now under scrutiny, Senate Bill 277 was the law of the land. Since then, however, SB 277 was replaced by SB 276 and SB 714, which carry different requirements.

Of issue is whether or not SB 277 changed the conditions under which medical vaccine exemptions could be written, in essence allowing for reasons beyond those covered by the contraindications and precautions laid out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

The Medical Board of California is arguing that SB 277 did not change these standards to allow for a broader set of eligible criteria, while Dr. Stoller and his legal team are arguing that it did.

“Our view is that SB 277 did change the law and standards, or at the very least, many physicians thought it granted them the authority to write broader than ACIP based exemptions upon a determination that immunization was not safe for a particular child,” reads a Go Get Funding update from Jaffe.

“At the hearing, we hope to have Senator Pan explain some of his statements which sure sounded like physicians had that discretion.”

This is a David vs. Goliath case, but we can do it!

Richard Pan, as you probably know, is the infamous vaccine “Mercury Joker” and California senator who’s responsible for eliminating the state’s religious and philosophical vaccine exemption clauses, which had had previously been on the books there for many decades.

Pan is a vaccine industry whore who we know has taken untold tens of thousands of dollars in campaign money from the pharmaceutical industry. He’s also a believer in “medical extremism,” meaning he supports forced-at-gunpoint “medicine” as part of a state-run medical police state.

He’s a dangerous Chicom, in other words, who some suspect may be secretly working for the communist Chinese regime to help implement a total medical police state not just in California but throughout the United States.

Because Pan and the other pro-vaccine elements trying to persecute Dr. Stoller are extremely well-funded, he’s up against a giant in much the same way that David faced Goliath. But as we know from that biblical account, David won because he had God on his side, and we believe that Dr. Stoller is in much the same boat trying to fight for medical freedom in the state of California.

One of the latest updates from Jaffe explains that this brave man needs our help. Dr. Stoller has refused to give the Medical Board of California the settlement it requested, which would have revoked all of his previously written medical exemptions, putting these patients in harm’s way.

“To resolve the case, we proposed a resolution which did not jeopardize the medical exemptions, but that was rejected by the board,” Jaffe further explains.

Fortunately, Jaffe is convinced that the judge in the case is “smart, deliberate and reasonable,” and will do the right thing.

72,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions Gerald Celente as a trends researcher who is making forecasts about the global economy.,True,"The article discusses actions such as the decline in oil prices, the decrease in demand for energy and commodities in China, and the continuation of quantitative easing.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Top trends researcher Gerald Celente is forecasting a slowing global economy in 2015, and oil is a leading indicator. Celente explains, “It’s all in oil. We’ve been talking about oil prices since they peaked in June of this year. Now, you are seeing a 30% decline in Brent crude and West Texas (crude oil). This is big and it’s not a manipulated market. This is real. Yes, supply is up, but demand is down, and demand is down big time. You don’t have to look at that as an assumption, you can look at that as a fact. Here’s the fact. The fact is China is one of the biggest consumers of energy and commodities in the world. You are seeing investment in China coming down to 2000 levels. You are seeing production falling back to great recession levels in 2008 and 2009. . . . This is a global slowdown. It’s in front of everybody’s eyes, and oil is telling the story.”

So, what’s in store for 2015? Let’s start with the global economy. Celente says, “The economy is on a decline and it’s unquestionable. They are boosting the equity markets with record low interest rates. It’s a Ponzi scheme, and at some point, it has to explode.” Celente goes on to preview a taste of the 2015 Trends Journal. Celente says, “One of the trends for 2015 is ‘bankism,’ not capitalism. Capitalism is dead. This isn’t capitalism. Four words killed it, and they are ‘too big to fail.’ Quantitative easing hasn’t stopped. They keep doing it, they just change the game.”

So, which do we get first: a global economic crash or a global world war? Celente says, “I would say first would come the economic calamity, but you don’t know what will cause it. For example, when 9/11 happened, they closed down Wall Street. If there is a terrorist strike, either false flag or real, they will blame the economic conditions on these terrorists. . . . They will use it as an excuse. So, you don’t know whether it’s heads or tails, but the coin will be flipped.”

On the Middle East U.S. policy, Celente says, “It’s madness. Look what they did with Libya. We had to get rid of that Gadhafi. Remember that one? Great job, guys. Terrific. You turned the whole place into chaos, and you created the conditions for more destabilization around the area. People like ISIS and these other people got the guns now and the weapons. . . . There’s one failure after another.”

What will the economy look like to the man on the street when the economy finally takes a fall? Celente predicts, “It’s going to be inflation, but it’s going to be currency devaluation rather than commodity inflation, for example: oil. We see oil prices coming down. As the currency becomes devalued, it will cost you more to buy that commodity because they just continue to print more money and put it into the global system. It’s not only the United States, look what’s going on in China. There are estimates that there are 70 million luxury apartments they can’t sell in China. You read the data, and you see the government is boosting the economy.”

On gold, Celente says, “When gold was around $1,200 per ounce, I said it had a downside risk of between $100 and $150 an ounce. We sent that out in the Trends Monthly. I am in gold for the long haul. Why would I want to be in Bitcoin, bucks or anything else when I see what’s going on. . . . To me, it’s a rigged game, and the game only stays rigged for so long. I don’t buy gold to speculate. . . . I buy for possession. Gold could go down more, but I invest in gold for my golden years. Why would I invest in anything when I know they are keeping interest rates low worldwide to juice their markets?

The Wikileaks organization has released bombshell documentation revealing a massive cover-up of a dissenting report that found no chemical weapons were used by Syrian government forces against rebels in the city of Douma in 2018.

As reported by The Gateway Pundit, the Wikileaks release is the fourth batch in a series of leaked documents from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

In one leaked email exchange dated February 27-28, members of a fact-finding team that had deployed to the city and officials with the OPCW, Sebastien Braha, the watchdog agency’s Chief of Cabinet, ordered removal of “all traces” of a report written by an expert named Ian Henderson.

The email reads, “Please get this document out of DRA (Documents Registry Archive)… And please remove all traces, if any, of its delivery/storage/whatever in DRA.”

Henderson had traveled to Douma to inspect a pair of cylinders that were discovered at the site of the alleged attack.

According to reports, the April 7 attack involved a chemical agent which killed between 50 and 70 people, injuring hundreds more. Rebel forces in the city attributed the attack to the Syrian government army. The U.S., Britain, and France also attributed the attacks to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and as a result launched a limited retaliatory attack against his forces.

Video from the scene at the time showed dead men, women, and children, with some foaming at the mouth. Medical personnel who responded to the alleged attack reported smelling a chlorine-like odor but symptoms and the number of dead led analysts to conclude it was something more powerful, such as a sarin nerve agent.

Almost immediately, conspiracies formed suggesting that the attack was staged — that the Syrian government did not use chemical weapons against their own people.

But those theories were struck down by ‘officialdom.’

In his report, however, Henderson concluded that the cylinders containing the chemical substance he found on the scene were more than likely simply placed there, not dropped from an aircraft. His findings pointed to an “attack” that was actually staged.

Did the West seriously fall for this?

Since the cylinders appeared to be placed by hand, and the area was under the control of anti-government forces, Henderson’s findings lend credence to theories that the attack was staged to set up the Syrian president and prompt the US to attack.

In addition, Wikileaks published minutes from a June 6, 2018 meeting where OPCW members met with “three Toxicologists/Clinical pharmacologists, one bioanalytical and toxicological chemist,” all of whom specialize in chemical weapons.

The purposes behind the meeting were “to solicit expert advice on the value of exhuming suspected victims of the alleged chemical attack in Douma on 7 April 2018” and “to elicit expert opinions from the forensic toxicologists regarding the observed and reported symptoms of the alleged victims.” (Related: Bombshell: Syria’s ‘chemical weapons’ turn out to be sodium fluoride used in the U.S. water supply and sold at Wal-Mart.)

In particular, the officials were interested in “whether the symptoms observed in victims were consistent with exposure to chlorine or other reactive chlorine gas.”

At the meeting the experts informed OPCW that “with respect to the consistency of the observed and reported symptoms of the alleged victims with possible exposure to chlorine gas or similar, the experts were conclusive in their statements that there was no correlation between symptoms and chlorine exposure.”

But again — the alleged attack led to a response by the West against Syrian government targets, a response that appears to have been based on a lie."

Trump “is an ongoing coup to remove a duly elected President.” Shipp contends, “This is a huge constitutional crisis like the country has never seen before. This makes Watergate look like a Sunday school class.”

On Friday, Shipp and other retired top officials at the CIA, FBI, DOJ and NSA held a press conference and demanded Attorney General Jeff Sessions prosecute top Obama era officials for obvious crimes against the incoming Trump Administration. Shipp says, “We have a coup within our government right now at the senior levels at the CIA, DOJ and the FBI attempting to unseat a duly elected President who was elected by the American people and remove him from office. . . .This is, at worst, treason with senior officials in the shadow government or Deep State . . . to attack Donald Trump and remove him from office. . . . We have not seen anything like this since the Presidency of John F. Kennedy (JFK), when CIA Director Allen Dulles attacked him, and we saw what happened there. . . . There is crystal clear evidence that the CIA was, at least, involved with the cover-up of the JFK assassination. Now, we have the same thing happening again. . . . Remember what Chuck Schumer said, and it was chilling. He said, ‘If you cross the intelligence community, they can hit back at you six ways from Sunday.’ That’s what we are seeing now. It’s collusion or a coup with senior officials at the FBI, DOJ and CIA along with Robert Mueller to unseat an elected president.”

Shipp goes on to explain, “There is essentially a civil war involving parts of senior management and upper parts of our government that is occurring in the United States. It’s between the ‘Dark’ side and the ‘Constitutional’ side. There has never been anything like this in history. It is extremely serious, and this is an extremely serious hour for our government and especially for our constitutional freedoms. . . . This essentially is a global criminal cabal that has penetrated into our government and now has senior level officials colluding and, I would argue, conspiring to unseat this president.”

In closing, Shipp says, “People need to understand that the Democrat Party today is not the Democrat Party of John F. Kennedy. The Democrat Party with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is more Marxist than anything else. They think the Constitution should be a ‘progressive’ document. In other words, the Constitution is outdated and should be redone. They are both directly connected into George Soros, who wants to destroy the sovereignty of the U.S. government. . . . The Democrat Party is now made up of Marxists and leftists that have penetrated that entire organization. . . . Their entire goal is to change our form of government and destroy our sovereignty.”

Millions of Americans voted for President Trump precisely because he promised to disrupt the foreign policy status quo. He promised a new, “America First” foreign policy that many in the Washington establishment derided. And the President has delivered, bringing fresh and successful approaches to foreign policy in a host of areas, including

In particular, with respect to Ukraine and elsewhere, his foreign policy has focused on ensuring that America does not shoulder a disproportionate burden for various international missions, that other countries do their fair share, and that taxpayer dollars are not squandered.

House Democrats’ theory that a purported inter-agency “consensus” among career bureaucrats can be used to show improper motive is an affront to the tens of millions of American citizens who voted for President Trump’s foreign policy and not a continuation of the Washington establishment’s policy preferences.

With help from PhD Scientist and Biochemist, Brian Hooker, the agency has finally had to reveal that they have known for years that thimerosal, which was banned in 1999, but still used in over 60 vaccines, causes autism.

Robert F. Kennedy has been trying to alert the public of the same troublesome findings that Hooker has unveiled, but he is often dismissed, or worse, made into a media fool by the pharmaceutical industry.

What is Thimerosal and Why Should I Care?

Thimerosal is a mercury-based vaccine adjuvant (preservative) that causes a number of brain-injuring problems, with autism among them. Thimerosal is also a human carcinogen, mutagen, and teratogen that also interrupts the immune system and interrupts proper fetal development.

Thimerosal, is metabolized into toxic, and highly dangerous methylmercury. From there, the methylmercury is converted into the even more harmful, persistent, inorganic mercury that is retained in our physical tissues to wreck havoc on our health. For the immune-sensitive, this is the equivalent of a one-two punch.

That must be why the World Health Organization (WHO) thinks thimerosal is ‘safe.’ It follows right along with their covert agenda to thin the herd.

There is no safe level of exposure to this neurotoxin, yet it is still used widely by Merck, Eli Lilly, and numerous other pharmaceutical companies. It is also still used in almost every flu vaccine currently administered.

According to Hooker, hundreds of thousands of babies born between 1991 and 1997, had their vaccine files analyzed by CDC epidemiologist Thomas Verstraeten, MD. Hooker says that this, “proves unequivocally that during 2000, CDC officers were knowledgeable internally of the very high hazard of autism, non-natural sleep problem and speech disorder associated with Thimerosal exposure.”

These alarming facts, along with the testimony of whistleblowers like Kennedy expose the CDC as a dangerous, even murderous, government agency that cannot be trusted.

They have lied to scientific bodies, fixed data, and withheld important information that could have prevented any number of autism cases, among other health dangers.

With over 22 different medical cases that prove vaccines can cause autism, and the latest documentation from Hooker that reveals what the CDC has withheld, why would anyone trust this agency as a protector of public health?

Dr. Hooker’s is adamant about what must happen going forward:

It will take vigilance with propaganda being slung from every direction."

The following is the result of a study on biblical parental responsibility in regards to the practice of unclean, unsafe vaccines.

· A diligent study on vaccine safety and effectiveness reveals that there are many informed and qualified researchers and doctors who have found and teach that there are many serious health risks involved with vaccines. The Comprehensive Child Health Immunizations Act of 1993 made known the fact that there are risks to vaccinations by stating “Vaccine information should be simplified to ensure that parents understand the benefits and risks”. Congressional Records (2000 – 2003) have shown that the pharmaceutical companies are more concerned with profit than they are with safety and have knowingly used toxins in the manufacturing of vaccines regardless of the risks.

· The Bible teaches us that children are a gift from God (1 Timothy 5:8). Some vaccines are produced using aborted baby lung tissue, which are man and government profiting from the murder of our innocent children. To partake in vaccines is to support that individuals/government that no longer has respect for the sanctity of human life.

· The Bible teaches that the parents are entrusted with the care and welfare of the child. (1 Timothy 5:8). Parents, not the state, are responsible to make health care decisions on behalf of their children.

· The Bible also teaches that there have been times in history when evil government and government employees have attempted, through force or color of law, to intimidate, harm or destroy the children of God’s people. (Exodus 1 and 2/ Matthew 2). Therefore, if a parent feels that vaccines are not safe, it is their responsibility to defend our children from and individual or government who is attempting to subject our children to those vaccine risks.

· The Bible teaches that the body is “The temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) To inject known neurotoxins into our children, which have known health risks, would be a violation of these biblical teachings.

· The Bible teaches that there are clean and unclean animals and that God’s people are not to put the unclean into their bodies. Many vaccines are made from the blood of diseased animals, decomposed animal parts and are not sterile.

· The Bible teaches that when man’s law contradicts God’s law, His people must obey God over man. (Acts 5:29) Therefore, be it known, should any policy, edict or legislation of man decree our children must be vaccinated, we must obey God rather than man just as Moses’ parents of old, we will do so without fear. (Exodus 2)

· The Bible teaches us that we are not to harm or wrong our neighbor. (Romans 13:10 and James 2:8) Our decisions to decline vaccines do not wrong or threaten our neighbor. If vaccines were truly effective, the neighbor would not be in danger from someone who is not vaccinated.

Therefore, be it known, that based upon the teachings of the Holy Bible, it is our religious conviction not to have our children vaccinated. We desire to be at peace with those who may feel or think differently than we do on this issue and that is why we humbly explain the choice we have made. We will protect our children from the injection of neurotoxins, retroviruses and foreign animal proteins that are in vaccinations."

If you have ever been ticked off at the government about having more days left at the end of the month than you have dollars to cover remaining expenses, then you are not alone. But is it really the government’s fault? “The Government” for the most part is not at fault.

There is this nasty little (being facetious about little) thing called “The Federal Reserve.” They handle ‘all things money’ beginning with the paper, ink and printing press. The Federal Reserve… it has a nice official sounding name that couldn’t be further from the truth. #1) It is not a Federal Agency. #2) It holds Nothing in Reserve.

A legacy from the President Wilson administration, the Fed dictates interest rates and regulates the banking sectors as the most opaque agency in Washington. “How does the Fed set interest rate policy?” a member of Congress might ask in a Dog and Pony Show oversight hearing. “None of your business” is pretty much the not-at-all polite response. (There is No oversight and they hear Nothing.)

If you are getting more upset than when you first started to read this article, wait there’s more!

Earlier you said to yourself, ‘I thought we had a Treasury Department’ to take care of printing money and holding it in reserve and working with Congress to set Monetary Standards. Nope. I thought Treasury printed money and was in charge of Fort Knox and guarded our gold reserve to back the U.S. Dollar. Yes and No and that opens a can of worms right there. Gold taken out and given to the Fed to print money, which then disappeared. Other countries has stored Gold in Fort Knox and then reported that it too disappeared. I’ll stop here about Fort Knox as that is a story in and of it’s self.

Let’s get back to The Fed and remember what it is and isn’t. It is in charge of our money via President Wilson and his administration beginning in 1913. It is in lock-step with the Rothschilds and the other One World Banksters and in realty, reports to no one in the U.S. Government, except for the afore mentioned ‘dog and pony’ show. It creates money out of thin air with nothing to back it. (Fiat Currency) This throws another log on the fire of speculation that Fort Knox has none or very little gold in storage/reserve.

If you think the Fed is just a bunch of mundane ‘bean counters’ setting at a desk working a calculator… think again…

President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order #11110 that closed down the Fed and the U.S. Treasury began printing money backed by Americas gold reserve. The Banksters “took care of business” on a sunny day in Dallas, Texas. Each and every President since has taken JFK’s assassination into account when The Fed becomes part of the conversation. That is why there is a lot of tough talk about The Fed, but little action.

We The People now have an opportunity to finish what JFK gave his life for.

WE THE PEOPLE ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CALL ON CONGRESS TO ACT ON AN ISSUE:

It also mentions the mortality rate and residual paralysis associated with NPAFP.,True,"The article connects events and observations, such as the correlation between pulse polio rounds and NPAFP rates, the decline of NPAFP after India was declared 'polio-free', and the adverse effects of the oral polio vaccine.",False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"The WHO declared India “polio free” in May 2014, so why are close to half a million young Indians experiencing polio-like paralysis?

A new study titled Correlation between Non-Polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis Rates with Pulse Polio Frequency in India has recently been published in the Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. Using data obtained from the National Polio Surveillance Programme (NPSP) as reported by the Government of India, the findings corroborate well over a decade of research showing a strong link between rates of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) and India’s oral polio vaccine (OPV) campaign. The incidence of polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in India has decreased. However, the NPAFP rate has increased since 2000.

In 2005 there was a sharp increase, more than doubling, in India’s national NPAFP rate which coincided with the introduction of a high-potency monovalent vaccine. The new vaccine contained five times the number of Type 1 viruses compared to the previously used one. Pulse polio immunization refers to periodically vaccinating all children under the age of five years against the polio virus. The study’s authors previously showed in 2012 that the subsequent ‘pulses’ sharply increased the rate of NPAFP when more than six rounds of pulse polio are used in the year.

In the recent study, NPAFP rates in Indian states from 2000 to 2017 were examined and again found a high correlation between the number of pulse polio rounds conducted and the NPAFP rate in the state. The researchers state:

India has been considered ‘polio-free’ for over 6 years. In the absence of wild polio transmission, it was expected that the AFP rate would reduce to around 2/100,000 however that has not happened. The exaggerated NPAFP rates of anywhere between 6.43/100,000 to 35/100,000 found in the new study fall well above the expected rate of 2/100,000.

A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional 491,000 paralyzed children above expected numbers for children with NPAFP according to the new study. The authors state:

Are these numbers just artifacts related to over-enthusiastic reporting by governments? An analysis in 2005 showed that where one-fifth of the cases of NPAFP were followed up for 60 days in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, 8.5% of them had died, and 35% were found to have been left with residual paralysis. A 2007 analysis of NPAFP data from Uttar Pradesh found that the mortality rate in patients with NPAFP was twice the mortality rate for wild polio.

The first detail that demands attention was that the rates of NPAFP were higher, more than doubling, which coincided with the introduction of the monovalent vaccine. Second, it was after India was declared ‘polio-free’ the NPAFP rate was shown to decline with a reduction in the pulse polio doses as the country tapered back the polio vaccine program. Although the AFP surveillance data from India does not provide information about the etiology of the NPAFP cases, OPV and its associated campaigns have been continually shown to leave increased rates of adverse effects across the globe. Will the World Health Organization take into account the body of scientific evidence showing issues with their polio campaigns? Will the Indian government and health authorities implement steps to intervene in their OPV campaigns to reduce NPAFP rates?

You may recall that as the Obama administration rolled out the news that it had negotiated a “deal” with Iran to curb that country’s burgeoning nuclear program, reports surfaced that the White House had approved the payment of what can only be called a ransom to the terrorist-sponsoring regime.

No, it wasn’t a “ransom” paid to convince Iran to release four Americans it was holding hostage. But, strangely enough, the first installment of some $1.7 billion Obama eventually paid the Iranians arrived in cash, stacked on pallets in the back of a cargo plane that was delivered in the middle of the night.

The administration said the money was to settle a 40-year-old debt over a failed arms deal that went south after the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979.

Whatever the case, then-Secretary of State John Kerry later admitted “some” of the money would go to fund Iran’s terrorist activities.

But some would also go to fund the nuclear program the Iranians are still secretly building.

Having helped Iran keep its nuclear program funded, the Obama “deal” and resulting financing through direct payments and sanctions relief made it possible for officials in Tehran — including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei — to declare their intention of beginning the enrichment of uranium once again (if they ever really stopped).

As noted by The Daily Wire, Iran informed the Atomic Energy Agency on Tuesday that it will begin to increase enrichment capacity:

Ali Akbar Salehi, vice president and head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, stated that a letter had been given to the IAEA about the increase, and stated bluntly, “If conditions allow, maybe tomorrow night at Natanz, we can announce the opening of the center for production of new centrifuges” for uranium enrichment, adding, “What we are doing does not violate the (2015 nuclear) agreement.”

He further claimed that Iran’s action “does not mean that we will start assembling the centrifuges,” adding that the uranium enrichment plans “do not mean the negotiations (with Europe) have failed.” (Related: John Kerry’s Iran nuclear deal buddy, Mohammad Javad Zarif, caught on camera shouting ‘Death to America!’)

Last month, President Donald Trump announced he was pulling out of the Iran deal — which he claimed was “terrible” during his 2016 campaign — because after giving the Europeans and Iran more than a year to fix problems he saw as detrimental to the United States, they failed to get them addressed.

European countries have vowed to continue ‘honoring’ the original deal even as they continue their dialogue with Tehran, seemingly undercutting the U.S. — the country that continues to keep NATO afloat and a credible deterrent to a revisionist Russia.

Prior to Salehi’s comments, Khamenei said, “The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran is duty-bound to prepare the ground for achieving 190 thousand SWUs.” He further noted that plans would be “within the framework of the JCPOA [the nuclear deal] for the time being.”

Meanwhile, Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, explained, “The leader [Khamenei] meant that we should accelerate some process … linked to our nuclear work capacity to move forward faster in case needed.”

Mind you, Khamenei said last month that the original nuclear deal would remain in effect only if European signatories rolled over and permitted Tehran, without question, to continue its ballistic missile development and its support for various terrorist and militant proxies in the region, including Hamas and Hezbollah.

Needless to say, the Israelis aren’t happy about Iran’s thinly-veiled threat to restart the uranium enrichment process that Obama’s payments kept alive.

“If the Iranians don’t surrender now, and try to return” to un-monitored uranium enrichment, “there should be a clear statement by the President of the United States and all of the Western coalition” that “if the Iranians return” to uranium enrichment that eventually gives them enough fuel for a nuclear bomb, “a military coalition will be formed against them,” Israel’s intelligence chief, Israel Katz, said.

No wonder the Israelis didn’t think much of Obama.

Schiff says, “I was kind of a fixture on financial cable TV giving these warnings. My thought was the bubble would burst, and I knew that it would. Once the housing bubble burst and we had this financial crisis, I knew it would follow along with the Great Recession. I thought the Federal Reserve would try the best it could to reflate the bubbles in the stock markets and housing markets. But my thought was that their efforts would fail. The markets would not allow it and that a dollar collapse would intervene and would prevent new debt from being issued to fully reflate those bubbles. I was actually wrong. They didn’t just try to reflate the bubbles, they actually succeeded in blowing them bigger than ever.”

Ten years later, Schiff is warning of another financial calamity bigger than the last one. Schiff says, “The problem is now we are on the precipice of a much bigger crisis than before. The next time, if they try to reflate those bubbles, which they will, it will be a spectacular failure because the markets are now prepared for the opposite. Everybody, right now, assumes the Fed is going to be able to keep raising rates. They assume they are going to shrink its balance sheet and that we have this booming economy that will never bust. When the Fed has to reverse course abruptly, acknowledge the underlying weakness that everybody has been oblivious to and they start cutting rates and launching another round of quantitative easing (money printing), I think the dollar is going to fall through the floor. I think the inflationary fires that are already burning pretty hot are going to ignite. It’s not going to be like 2008 where the dollar went up and consumer prices inched down a little bit. I think the dollar is going to tank and consumer prices are going to soar, and it’s going to be stagflation. When the markets get a whiff of that, they are not going to like the way it smells. It is going to create a dollar crisis. I think the Fed has put itself between a rock and a hard place. There is no way out this time. . . . This time, you really have to be positioned because this time is going to be the end of it. This is not going to be a hat trick or third time is a charm when it comes to reflating these bubbles.”

On gold, Schiff contends, “People are going to be dumping their dollars and buying gold. . . . If you understood what the Fed was doing, you would be buying gold, but most people don’t understand. You can look at what has happened to gold prices in terms of other currencies, such as emerging markets. Obviously, gold prices in those countries measured in those currencies have gone up dramatically. So, gold has acted as a store of value and a store of purchasing power in every country where the currency has come down. The same thing is going to hold true of the United States. . . . We could do a reset. We could go back to sound money. We could go back on a gold standard, and we could devalue the dollar officially. I don’t know exactly how high the price of gold would have to be, $10,000 per ounce, $20,000 per ounce, who knows, but there is a price where we could go back to a gold standard. If we want to stay on a gold standard, that means the government would have to live within its means. That’s why governments hate gold standards because it provides discipline to government.

Cher at 65: Only a really dumb & delusional woman would wear this!

As reported by Breitbart’s Big Hollywood, Aug. 26, 2012, the 66-year-old post-menopausal crone tweeted that Rep. Todd Akin (R-Missouri), who had apologized for saying that “real” rapes don’t result in pregnancy, should get his karma by being anal-raped by a man and getting HIV/AIDS:

Come to think of it, didn’t Akin report to the authorities that he and his family and staff have received death and rape threats? The FBI seriously should pay Cher a visit.

What is it with left-wing post-menopausal women?

In 1995, Nina Totenberg, the 68-year-old legal affairs correspondent for the taxpayer-funded National Public Radio, wished conservative Senator Jesse Helms and his grandchildren would get AIDS, which is a virtual death sentence. Totenberg told the host of Inside Washington that if there was “retributive justice” in the world, Helms would “get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it.”

See also DCG’s post on another vicious post-menopausal left-wing crone, the 58-year-old actress Ellen Barkin, who calls conservatives “right wing fuckin morons,” expresses glee over Andrew Breitbart’s death, and hopes Hurricane Isaac would kill “every pro-life, xenophobic, gay-bashing SOB” at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay, FL.

Gosh, and here I’d always believed the Left when they congratulate themselves on being warm-&-fuzzy peace-&-light tolerant bleeding-hearts!

Rubino contends, “Government debt is going to soar going forward no matter what. Whether we have three more years of growth or a recession next year, we are going to see massive new deficits and massive increases in government debt all over the world. This is coming at a time when we have already hit record levels of debt and blown right through previous record levels. The last crisis, that almost ended the global financial system, was debt driven. The next one is going to be that much, much more serious because we basically doubled the amount of debt that’s out there since 2005 and 2006.”

On the political front, Rubino says, “The idea that things get more extreme from here is not that out of the ordinary and not that hard to believe. We are not just going to see gridlock here in the U.S., we are going to see chaos. That means of the things that should be gotten done, very few of them will be. . . . Political chaos is good for precious metals . . . both metals are way undervalued.”

Few would disagree, that at some point, the financial system is going to explode. Rubino says, “Let’s look at what happens when this finally blows up. The pressure is going to be on currencies when the financial system starts to spin out of control next time. In other words, people are going to see the amount of debt we are taking on, see the amount of currency we are creating to service all this debt, and will wonder what that does to the value of the currencies that are being aggressively created. They will lose faith in those currencies. What is unique about this time, countries have screwed up their currencies since the beginning of time . . . but this time around, they are all doing it. Every major country in the world has a printing press, which is to say an unlimited credit card. They are maxing out that credit card . . . and they are doing it simultaneously.”

In closing Rubino says, “All we have left is to wipe the slate clean and say, you know what, this thing did not work. It’s a 60 year experiment that turned out to have a fatal flaw, which is you can’t hand a printing press to a government.”

A gaggle of films either name-checked Al Gore’s biggest fear or built their narratives around it.

“But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?” 2 Peter 3:10-12 (KJV)

EDITOR’S NOTE: You can mark down that 2017 was the year that the American buying public got woke and enmasse rejected the Hollywood narrative of man-made-climate change. Every, single movie and documentary released was roundly rejected at the box office. And won’t the Liberals be so upset when God goes ahead and sets the whole thing on fire anyway? 0f course, when that happens at the Great White Throne Judgment, I don’t think that climate change will rank very high on their list of concerns. But the Lake of Fire sure will.

The timing, in theory, couldn’t be better for Hollywood bean counters: Three major hurricanes. Massive fires in the West. Record-setting chills. Media reports routinely connected the disasters with a warming planet.

Yet audiences stayed away from films influenced by eco-concerns. Far, far away.

Think “Blade Runner 2049,” “Geostorm,” “Downsizing,” “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power” and “mother!” They all flopped, some in spectacular fashion.

Mr. Gore’s sequel to his documentary smash “An Inconvenient Truth” paid the most attention to climate change, of course. The 2006 original scored with audiences and Oscar voters, earning best documentary honors. The sequel snared a fraction of the first film’s tally: $3 million versus $24 million. That’s despite massive media attention, mostly fawning reviews and promotion from eco-conscious stars such as Paul McCartney, Bono and Pharrell Williams.

 In spite of this popular and positive development, criticisms to the ongoing operations are so loud enough they have irritated the incumbent president.

 

 In response, 7 sitting judges, 54 mayors and congressmen, and hundreds of police officers including police generals, were named by President Rodrigo Duterte just hours ago as having been involved in the proliferation of illegal drugs nationwide.

 

 In relation thereto, the president didn’t bother to ask for their voluntary surrender. He already said that prior to formally assuming office. Recently instead, he ordered them to be shot on sight.

 Some of those named were known to him personally, including the former mayor of Cebu City, a tourism hub in the Visayas area.

 

 To the persistent noise coming from the Oligarchy owned corporate media and various human rights NGOs pretending to show concern over the spate of summary killings in the ongoing campaign against the drug menace, Duterte is now challenging all of them to prove their bleeding hearts for humanitarian cause by accepting the 600,000 drug users/pushers and still counting, who chose to voluntarily surrender mostly out of fear of being summarily executed, and are now opting for rehabilitation.

 Duterte said, there is an estimated 3 million drug addicts in the country according to some data he received 3 years ago. He is asking the military to host all those drug surrenderees inside their camps. For those who cannot be rehabilitated anymore will be put in an island for quarantine, i.e. akin to Lepers’ Island.

 High profile convicts will also be transferred to a high security island to prevent them from running the drug enterprise through wireless communication like they have been doing until Duterte assumed office more than a month ago.

 Inside their existing cells, these convicted druglords were able to cook meth and ran their business without interruption.

 

 It is our understanding that all those summary killings, i.e. 500 deaths to date, can be categorized into three flavors:
• those who were killed because they are potential witnesses to government officials’ involvement;
• those who fight it out with the police, paranoid under the influence of drugs, and;
• those who were executed by vigilantes.

The government officials named by President Duterte to have been involved in the sale and distribution of drugs nationwide, and in the protection of drug criminals are:

 Judges

The above list is incomplete as some names are still being revalidated.

 The 91% trust rating the majority has given Duterte at this early means that they know what motivates those empty “human rights” criticism against their president, i.e. the Oligarchy and the Church’s common powerbase has been effectively uprooted and no longer will the people allow themselves to be deceived again.

 To the old guards, Duterte is an anomaly. They could not believe that he has already delivered a third of what he had promised during the campaign, with barely 40 days into his 6-year term as president.

 On top of the above accomplishment, a major shakedown in the local industries are already underway:
• Already, an oligarch Roberto Ongpin controlling online betting stepped down as chairman of PhilWeb after his company shares plunged 36.88% as a direct result of Duterte’s dropping his name [here];
• 7 destructive mining operations in Mindanao were closed down last week and the local citizenry were deputized to guard forests and rivers from further exploitation;
• Issuance of the Freedom of Information EO for the entire executive branch of the government;
• scalawags at the NAIA international airport are removed and daily maintenance of basic terminal facilities are turned over to airline companies; private jets are also being transferred to a nearby airport to ease air traffic congestion;
• 9,000 stranded overseas workers in the Middle East are to be brought home soon;
• massive cleanup operations are being undertaken in city streets to ease traffic congestion and further reduce petty crimes.
• 50% end of labor contractualization will be implemented by the end of the year; 100% by the end of next year;
• salaries of public teachers, police and military personnel will be doubled up by December 2016;
• Call numbers 8888 for public service feedback system, and 911 emergency response are on their early stages; Duterte is aiming for an expanded version of his free of charge 911 Central Emergency Response in Davao City, to mitigate nationwide emergency requirements;
• massive farming assistance in the countryside, and the introduction and training in vertical hydrophonic farming for urban dwellers.

The only spoiler so far is the recent withdrawal of the government’s unilateral ceasefire extended to the communists for the latter’s failing to reciprocate and instead initiated an ambush against a group of CAFGUs using a landmine.

 

 For the first time since our first peaceful revolution in 1986,the people are highly inspired and motivated to organize and contribute their own time and skills for the long awaited, real and meaningful nation building.

 It should not surprise everyone when this country rises up from mediocrity in the next 6 years due to the growing spirit of volunteerism and the massive infrastructure projects already in the pipeline.

How can anyone deny we are living on the threshold of the “Crazy Times” right now or argue that psychopaths are not eternally embedded in important positions in government and within our intelligence services?)

Chuck Hagel has been fired by Obama from his position as Defense Secretary. Hagel, a former GOP Senator, was appointed by Obama in early 2013 and therefore was scheduled to serve for the entirety of Obama’s second term.

Prior to his appointment, Hagel is said to have visited the White House in 2009, and personally warned Obama that he should look out for rogue elements within the Pentagon that were leading a ‘new world order’.

This was not reported on some internet conspiracy forum, it was a leading report published shortly before Hagel’s appointment, by Bob Woodward, an award winning journalist and associate editor with The Washington Post.

According to an account that Hagel gave, he told Obama: “We are at a time where there is a new world order.”

“We don’t control it. You must question everything, every assumption, everything they” — the military and diplomats — “tell you. Any assumption 10 years old is out of date. You need to question our role. You need to question the military. You need to question what are we using the military for.” Hagel is said to have told the President.

The Post report also stated that Hagel warned Obama about becoming “bogged down” in the ongoing war in Afghanistan, saying it would define Obama’s first term. Hagel reportedly later privately questioned the wisdom of sending additional troops to join the conflict.

“If Hagel is confirmed, as appears likely, he and the president will have a large task in navigating this new world order.” The Post report concluded at the time.

It remains to be discovered as to whether or not Hagel attempted to oust the rogue elements within the military industrial complex. The last straw for Hagel, though, may have been comments he made last week during a sit down interview with Charlie Rose at the Pentagon.

During the exchange, Hagel expressed a belief that US military action against ISIS was “indirectly benefiting” the Syrian President Bashar Assad, comments that were sure to have been unwelcome by the powers that be, given its push for airstrikes against the Syrian government last year.

Hagel also said that “The world is damn dangerous,” adding that the US military is unprepared.

Hagel criticized defense budget cuts and stated outright “We won’t have the readiness. We won’t have the capability. We won’t have long-term investments that this institution requires to stay ahead of everybody else, as we have since World War II, with the technological edge, with the ability to continue to recruit and retain the best people.”

Hagel was also critical of US foreign policy, noting that “policies are predicated on historical knowledge and cultural awareness and all that goes into that. Have we made mistakes over a series of many years? Yeah, I think we have. I think anybody would agree to that.”

In short, Hagel is no longer in a job because he alluded to rogue globalist elements within the US military, criticized the long imperial march to war, and admitted to detrimental blowback in the ‘war on terror’. Yeah, that’ll do it.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has lashed out at the UK, accusing Prime Minister Theresa May of leading the US, UK, and France into staging chemical attacks in Syria.

Calling May a ""colonialist liar,"" Assad says the United Kingdom and other New World Order ""puppets"" performed false flag attacks and incited civil war in his country.

The Syrian leader stated that the Western alliance is deliberately causing unrest in Syria in a bid to trigger an ""illegal"" invasion.

He also likened the treatment of his country to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which was later proved to be unjustified.

During a rare interview, the Syrian President says the alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, East Ghouta in Syria on April 7th was staged.

According to reports from the controversial organization the White Helmets and rebels Jaish al-Islam (The Sword of Islam), the Syrian military dropped bombs containing an unknown chemical weapon from helicopters.

But Assad claims the UK had a role to play in the alleged attack in which at least 40 people are said to have been killed in order to justify airstrikes.

Assad said: “The UK publicly supported the White Helmets that are a branch of Al Qaeda.

“We consider the White Helmets to be a PR stunt by the UK. So yes, definitely, it was staged by these three countries together and the UK is involved.”

He insists no attack took place and this is supported by evidence of Western journalists who visited the area and Syria’s own intelligence.

He added: “It was a lie. After we liberated that area our information confirmed the attack did not take place.

“The British Government should prove with evidence that the attack happened, and then they should prove who is responsible.

""This did not happen.”

No right to lecture other nations

Following the alleged attack, the US, U, and France launched airstrikes against Syria and targeted several chemical weapons facilities.

The coalition claimed it was to punish Assad for “persistent violations.”

But Assad claims the UK and its allies have no right to lecture other nations.

He continued: “The story you’re talking about is that this is a bad president; he’s killing his own people, and the world is against him.

“But he’s been in his position for seven years while he’s fighting everyone in this world.

""Can you convince your readers of this? It’s not logical.

""This president is in his position because he has the support of his own people.

“We are fighting the terrorists and those terrorists are supported by the British Government, the French government, the American and their puppets.”

He also said the Syrian Civil war was prolonged because of the UK and the US.

The Syrian dictator said western powers need to leave his country to allow an end to the devastating war which has killed half a million people and displaced over 11million.

Assad said: “I have always said that in less than a year we can solve this conflict, it’s not complicated.

“What has made it complicated is the external interference.

""The more we advance, the more support terrorists have from the West.

“So, we think the more advances we make politically and militarily, the more that the West, especially the US, UK, and France, will try to prolong it and make the solution farther from the Syrians.”

The president also claimed the foreign policy being pursued by the UK and its allies is a “colonial” one which has been pursued since the start of the 20th Century.

He concluded: “Britain and the US attacked Iraq illegally in 2003.

“They killed millions, caused mass destruction, let alone the number of widows and amputees.

“This is colonial policy, that’s how we see it, and this is not new. They have never changed this policy... that existed in the beginning of the 20th century.

“For the US, the UK, and France their presence [in Syria] is illegal.

“It is an invasion, they are breaching the sovereignty of Syria. They don’t accept anyone who has a different point of view.

“The past five years have proved that I was right. Look at the terrorism spreading all over the world because the chaos that is supported by the West in Syria.

“Syria is very independent in its political positions. We work for our national interests, we’re not a puppet state.”"

Wigington says, “They have to control the message, and notice they always use the term ‘chemtrails’ because that term always leads to a dead end. It’s not a scientific term, and they want us to use that term. You don’t see them using the geoengineering, climate engineering, solar radiation management and aerosol injection term because they don’t want people to understand this issue is real. Why the Senate hearings? Because the elephant in the room is almost impossible to hide, and they are trying to pacify populations until the last possible moment. They want to tell the population what they want to hear–that this is only a proposal. They are saying this must start immediately when this has been going on for 70 years . . . this is the Orwellian world we live in. We have massive toxic aerosol, heavy metal spraying in our atmosphere that could not be more visible. It’s blotting out the sun. . . . These programs are completely out of control. . . .We are on the road to planetary omnicide. Climate engineering is the greatest and most immediate assault we face. Climate engineering, look at this like the pharmaceutical approach to planet earth. Hide the symptoms even if you are making the overall situation exponentially worse. That’s what they are doing. We have had these radical whiplash weather scenarios where it goes from 80 to 90 degrees to snow in a day or two. This weather whiplash is not natural in any way, shape or form.”

Wigington contends that the situation is much worse than anyone thinks, and it’s mainly because of climate engineering. Wigington explains, “Our situation is far, far more dire and immediate than anyone comprehends, and climate engineering is making it worse not better. Official statistics say 20 million people could starve in the coming months, and that number will increase radically and exponentially. The biosystems of the planet are imploding.”

A legal team working on behalf of GeoEngineeringWatch.org is suing to get NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration) to give up its climate engineering information and has hit a brick wall. Wigington contends, “There is no hiding from what’s coming. . . . NOAA is not returning our FOIA’s, Freedom of Information Act

requests. They are legally required to give those to our attorneys, and they are not doing that. In fact, NOAA, in essence, flipped us the middle finger by sending back FOIA’s saying they know nothing about any sort of weather modification anywhere ever. Think how absurd this is when there are 300 regional weather modification programs that NOAA is required to sign off on every single year. They are denying all of it. This is the biggest cover-up in human history, with the largest most extensive operation in history, with the cooperation of governments around the globe. That is not speculation. You have to look and understand the gravity of the situation that is unfolding. Countries around the globe, whatever you are focused on, if it’s not saving the life support systems of the planet, everything else amounts to arranging deck chairs on the Titanic. . . . This is the single most destructive endeavor ever launched by the human race. Mathematically, it’s the greatest threat we face short of nuclear catastrophe.”

Any form of anthropogenic activity that impacts Earth's natural processes must be considered a form of geoengineering.

At the time, I was working as an investigative correspondent for CNN. I interviewed Williams for a story about the coming financial crisis. Most so-called experts, at the time, did not see the financial meltdown coming, let alone that all the banks were in trouble. Williams’ assessment of the economy was spot on in 2008. I don’t see how you can characterize what we have now as anything but a “severe recession.” Accurate information is the first and foremost reason to use someone as a source when you are a journalist. In my experience, what I have gotten from Williams has been stellar. (Click here for the 2008 CNN story featuring Williams and his predictions for the President in 2012.) (Click here for shadowstats.com)

Williams also predicted 2 years ago we would have a “hyperinflationary depression” within 10 years. Then, about a year ago, he revised his prediction and narrowed the window to “five years.” The day before last Friday’s dismal jobs report, Williams said, “. . . the timing of the looming U.S. financial Armageddon is coming into better focus, with increasingly high risk of it breaking within the next six months to a year.”

“Financial Armageddon . . . within the next six months to a year.” I called Williams to see why the odds of calamity have accelerated. He told me on the phone last night, “What is happening now to bring the timing into focus is the economy IS turning down. It is no longer the perspective the economy is going to turn down. That, in turn, will eventually trigger all the problems with the dollar, the debt and the deficit.”

For confirmation the economy is rolling over, look no further than the awful jobs report from the government last Friday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported July payrolls fell 131,000. To add insult to injury, the June jobs number was revised downward. The economy lost 221,000 jobs which is considerably more than the 125,000 the government reported last month.

You want more confirmation the economy is in the tank? Also, last week, the government revealed a record 40.8 million Americans are now on food stamps. More budget woes can be seen at the state level. Congress just passed an emergency aid package worth $26 billion to save teachers’ jobs around the country. States are facing $200 billion in shortfalls in the coming months. California is one of the worst, with a $19 billion budget hole to fill and a $500 billion in underfunded pensions . Commercial and residential real estate is still losing value, and set to take another plunge.

So, what’s the government doing about the economy? The Fed has set interest rates at near 0% for more than a year and a half. The economy is not taking off. According to a recent article from financial writer Jim Willie, who has a PhD in Statistics, “Never in US history has a recession struck after several extended months of emergency ultra-low interest rates. This will be the first such occurrence. The policy response from the USFed must therefore be limited. They cannot reduce the official interest rate, unless below 0% (which did happen briefly in Japan). The nation stands on the doorstep of hyper-inflation. The only available tool within the USFed tool bag is Printing Pre$$ activity, pure monetization of both USTreasurys and USAgency Mortgage Bonds.” (For the complete Willie article click here.)

How much of a chance is there the Fed will just print money to pay bills? When asked how the Fed was going to stop the slide in the economy on CNBC, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said, “Quantitative Easing is our best bet.” For us regular folks, QE means printing money out of thin air. I talked about this in a recent post called “Money Printing Is Our Best Bet.”

How fast could things go downhill when real trouble starts? Mallory Factor at Forbes laid it out nicely in an article last week called “Collapse In Internet Time.” Factor writes, “In an age when billions of dollars in securities are traded in nanoseconds, when a 24-hour news cycle seems long, why should national decline be exempt from what the Germans call Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age? The Book of Revelation, speaking allegorically of ancient Rome, states, “Alas! Alas! You great city, you mighty city, Babylon! For in a single hour your judgment has come.” Ancient Rome surely did not expect its sudden fall any more than the Soviet Union did in 1991, or than America does now.” (Click here for the complete Forbes article.)

Ultimately, the immense debt and deficits of the United States will crush the dollar. In his most recent report, Williams says, “The unfolding renewed decline in economic activity now is likely to be one of the proximal triggers for an even greater systemic solvency crisis, one that will pummel the U.S. dollar, threaten the solvency of the U.S. government and set the stage for a hyperinflation in the United States. In turn, such a crisis would exacerbate the intensifying downturn into a hyperinflationary great depression.”

No one knows exactly when the buck will buckle, but it looks like the dollar will take a short walk off a tall building a lot sooner than later."
94,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,False,There is no explicit mention or indirect mention of an actor responsible for a threat or malicious actions.,False,There is no mention of powerful actors intentionally pursuing malicious motives or schemes.,False,There is no mention of a threat caused by an actor's action.,False,There is no connection of events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,There is no indication of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Last week, Bloomberg reported that for the third straight week in a row, record numbers of unemployed Americans had filed for benefits. The jobless number has climbed so high in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, that the total unemployment rate is now approaching 15 percent of the total U.S. workforce – a terrifying number that eclipses even the 10 percent reached at the peak of the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.

Understandably, millions of desperate Americans are waiting with bated breath for the strict lockdowns to be rolled back so that they can get back to work before they, too, lose their jobs.

The stark reality, however, is that fully reopening the economy in the immediate future is simply not feasible. If the lockdowns are reversed across the country before the right steps have been put in place to deal with the coronavirus pandemic – including the rollout of sufficient testing and other necessary measures – another wave of infections could be unleashed, and the economy could be impacted even more negatively.

And at least one expert believes that Americans may have to cope with the reality of having to face 18 months of rolling shutdowns.

As reported by MSN Money, Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has warned that unless an effective treatment or vaccine can be found for the coronavirus, it is likely that the U.S. economy will have to deal with many months of rolling shutdowns as the country deals with repeated disease flareups.

“We’re looking around the world,” Kashkari told CBS’s Face the Nation. “As they relax the economic controls, the virus flares back up again.

“We could have these waves of flareups, controls, flareups and controls until we actually get a therapy or a vaccine,” he added. “I think we should all be focusing on an 18-month strategy for our health care system and our economy.”

While Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and one of President Trump’s chief advisers on the coronavirus, has indicated that some parts of the economy could be reopened in May, he has warned that the disease could flare up again in the Fall.

And public health experts and state governors alike have repeatedly warned President Trump that people will not be able to return to work until coronavirus testing is seriously ramped up.

In the meantime, the government has pulled out all the stops to try to reduce joblessness and help Americans cope with the greatest international disaster to strike humanity in decades.

The U.S. central bank has responded aggressively to blunt the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy, launching an unprecedented range of emergency programs to support as much as $2.3 trillion in loans and slashing interest rates to nearly zero.

And the Fed has the potential to do even more.

Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester noted that the Fed is “likely not done,” and will continue to actively seek out additional ways to keep credit flowing through the economy.

“We’re always looking for things where if we have a tool to be able to do it, and if we think it’s needed, we’re going to do it,” she said.

But will it be enough? And how long will the average American be able to cope with these restrictive lockdowns? Do we have another 18 months left in us? Only time will tell.

In fact, 28 redacted pages from a congressional intelligence report are said to contain damning information that implicates the Saudis in the 2001 mass murder of American citizens.

Despite a bipartisan effort to release the information, the now notorious 28 pages are still being withheld from the public under the predictable guise of “national security.”

Now, thanks to a federal lawsuit in a Manhattan court, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel.

Two authors of the concealed pages may soon be called to testify in a court case currently pending against the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Former FBI investigator Michael Jacobson and former Justice Department attorney Dana Lesemann, both of whom investigated the terror strikes for the FBI, were given the assignment to track down possible leads connecting Saudi officials to the hijackers and then document their findings.

The evidence they compiled was recorded in the infamous 28 pages.

The duo also went on to work with the independent 9/11 Commission, where they unveiled even more corroboration. They uncovered an association between the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles, the Saudi Embassy in Washington D.C., and the the tragic events in 2001.

At a court hearing on July 30, lawyers for the victims’ families stated that the most major of allegations against the Saudis were purposefully left out of the final draft of the 9/11 Commission report.

Thumairy worked as a religious cleric and Saudi diplomat in Los Angeles at the time, while Bayoumi was employed by the Saudi Arabian Civil Aviation Authority in San Diego.

The judge presiding over the case now has a 60-90 day window to either dismiss the case or proceed on behalf of the victims’ families.

Jerry Goldman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, feels good about the future of the proceedings.

With so many unanswered questions surrounding 9/11, there is no telling what may be disclosed if the case is allowed to move forward.

The terrifying reality is that if the Saudis are found guilty of involvement in the events of 9/11, such a conclusion would only raise more questions than it would answer.

Who inside the United States government would be covering for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for so many years — and more importantly, why?"

Most of it is bogus.

God is the principle of our moral development.

If you don't believe in God, you don't believe in yourself.

(An atheist is a person who doesn't believe in his own perfectability, i.e. ""made in the image of God.""

When it comes to Self-work, most of us are unemployed.)

Our spiritual ""salvation"" lies in obeying God, i.e. putting God first. Romantic love diverts our energy from God to a flawed human being.

We are in love with Perfection (God.) have good and bad qualities. They're not worthy of the adoration that we are supposed to feel. Romantic love is a ruse. Mass brainwashing.

Usually, romantic Love is just lust rationalized, a delirium necessary to trick a man into marrying and starting a family. I'm not saying this isn't good, just that it should NOT be undertaken in a state of delusion. ""Love"" is asking a lot. Loyalty, trust, and caring companionship are more attainable. 



People scoff when I say Western society is a satanic cult. However, the proof is obvious. The word ""God"" is banned from mainstream public discourse. In fact, we are repulsed at His mere mention. Our minds shut down. We become angry. We have been brainwashed and don't know it. 



If I were wrong, God would be on our lips. After all, He is the Creative Intelligence behind life. He has Instructions for us. We should be praising Him and discussing His Plan.

We can't mention Him because Cabalist central bankers have their own Plan. They want to be God themselves and they control information and discourse. This is why love songs instead of hymns. 



We don't realize that we have a great need to feel loved by God, and to love Him. This need is sublimated in romantic love which is a form of idolatry. 



I don't have to tell you that 97 percent of all popular songs are love songs. A visitor from another planet would conclude that our religion is romantic love. 



But instead of recognizing the real object of our desire, we have fixated on the opposite sex, whom we mystify and idealize to reflect our true sublimated desire. 



I am not a Jungian, but I agree with Carl Jung's statement: ""If you take away God, man will invent a thousand false ones."" 



They have taken away God. You can't mention the word in polite company. As if, given the magnificence of the universe and the complexity of the natural world , the concept of a Creator and a Design is so outlandish that it must be banned. 



The people who want to replace God (with themselves) are responsible for our inability to mention or imagine God when it is so simple. 







God is synonymous with our spiritual ideals and desires: truth, beauty, love, peace, bliss, justice, and harmony. So don't blame God for letting bad things happen to good people. Bad people are responsible, the same people who abolished God. 



 We are God's agents. If we don't bring about his Kingdom, it won't happen. Eventually, we'll all become extinct."

Leftist actor and director Rob Reiner sounded the alarm on Monday on MSNBC’s “All In” warning that America will lose its Democracy to President Donald Trump's 'authoritarianism' if the Democratic presidential nominee fails to beat him.

Reiner also warned due to inaction on global warming; the earth would become uninhabitable.

While the director expressed support for former Vice President Joe Biden, he said:

“I was a Joe Biden supporter for a year. And my position always was if Joe Biden I knew there was going to be a lot of candidates.""

""I knew who all, you know, Elizabeth Warren, I knew Bernie was coming back, Cory Booker and all that,"" Reiner added.

""I said, if he can somehow make it through the Democratic primary process, he’s by far the best candidate to beat Donald Trump — first of all, to unite the party, to beat Donald Trump, to hold onto the Congress, to get the Senate, and to be able to govern and to be able to bring back the world to America’s side,"" he continued

On the subject of Trump’s 2016 victory, Reiner added:

“We know what he is now. We might not have known then. We know what he is now.""

""He’s a liar. He’s self-involved. He doesn’t understand how public policy works,"" he stated.

“This is very important. We are looking at two existential crises; democracy and the world, the earth.""

""If we don’t take this presidency away, we’re going to lose democracy, and we’re going to lose our ability to live on the earth,"" Reiner warned.

""And I want to just remind people, Bush/Gore. And people who are friends of mine said ‘I’m going to vote for Ralph Nader, there’s no difference between the candidates,'"" he said.

""Please, that’s a 20-year start on climate change, and we don’t go into Iraq. I’m just saying. You have to unify behind whoever.”

Last year, Reiner falsely claimed Trump was working with ""a foreign country"" to ""steal the last election"" and was plotting with Russia to do the same in 2020.

Reiner added that Trump “commits crimes on a daily basis,” but unsurprisingly failed to present any evidence for his allegations.

Reiner made the accusations in one of his trademark anti-Trump Twitter rants, in which he warns that America’s Founding Fathers “never anticipated” a president like Donald Trump.

“Our founding fathers never anticipated what we’re facing,"" the Princess Bride director said.

Last month, Reiner also incited violence against the president by urging Democrats to “punch” him in the nose.

The director branded Trump as 'schoolyard bully' and 'liar.'

The liberal director has been frequent in his anti-Trump tirades on Twitter and usually makes wild claims without backing it up with any evidence.

Iconic American filmmaker says he's undecided about the president

Iconic American filmmaker David Lynch has said that President Donald Trump ""could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history.""

According to the “Twin Peaks” creator, Trump is unrivaled in the political spectrum.

“He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much,” Lynch said in an exclusive interview with the guardian.

“No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.”

According to The Guardian Interview: Politically, meanwhile, Lynch is all over the map.

He voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and thinks — he’s not sure — he voted Libertarian in the presidential election.

“I am not really a political person, but I really like the freedom to do what you want to do,” says the persecuted Californian smoker.

He is undecided about Donald Trump.

“He could go down as one of the greatest presidents in history because he has disrupted the thing so much.

""No one is able to counter this guy in an intelligent way.”

Lynch thinks Trump is opening up space where other outsiders might not.

“Our so-called leaders can’t take the country forward, can’t get anything done.

""Like children, they are."

And as if that wasn’t shocking enough, she also announced that if parents don’t consent they will be denied family assistance payments.

But please keep in mind, even general anesthesia has risks; in fact, a study done in 2015 linked it to a “reduction in IQ and changes in brain structure.”
• Natural measles immunity—better protection and more long-term benefits than Vaccines

Here are some possible side effects of general anesthetic, courtesy of The Victorian Department of Health:
• Having sensation (and pain) during the operation
• Damage to the mouth, teeth, lips or tongue

Now, if those are just the risks associated with general anesthesia, can you imagine what might happen when vaccines are given at the same time? Has this ever been studied for safety? And what doctor in their right mind is ok with vaccinating a child while they are under anesthesia? And perhaps the biggest question of all, why aren’t those medically complex children being given a medical exemption?
• Canadian school board say no to mandatory vaccinations

While Leask didn’t speak to what exactly a “medically-complex” child was, it feels safe to assume they are kids with “neurological disorders such as Autism, whose conditions may have been caused by vaccination in the first place.”

Oh, the cruel and disgusting irony. Our hearts go out to the parents of those children who feel they have no choice. We cannot imagine.

The initiative came from The Higher Committee of Human Fraternity, who proposes that everyone, regardless of religion, participate.

All through 2019, we brought you story after stunning story of how the Roman Catholic Pope Francis actively began to build the One World Religion of Chrislam we see in Revelation. As we told you, Chrislam combines the counterfeit Christianity of Roman Catholicism, Islam, and apostate Judaism, and it is called by various names. We call it Chrislam because that is straight and to the point, but they call it the Abrahamic Faiths Initiative, and it is governed by something called the Higher Committee Of Human Fraternity. Click that last link to see Chrislam in all its end times ignominious glory.

“And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.” Revelation 17:5,6 (KJB)

In just 3 days from today, on May 14th, Pope Francis will be leading his One World Religion of Chrislam in global prayer to the gods of the this world, and asking them to end COVID-19 on the earth. You would have better luck asking the the same thing from your cat or toaster oven, as the gods neither hear, nor see, nor talk as the bible so clearly tells us in Deuteronomy 4:28. Remember how you always said how much you wanted to live in the end times, and watch bible prophecy coming to pass before your eyes? You’re doing that right now.

“And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” Revelation 13:11,13,14 (KJB)

One more thing, do you think the timing of Chrislam Day on May 14th is an accident or coincidence? The very day that history records that God regathered the nation of Israel after 2,000 years? Soon, and sadly, Pope Francis or the next Pontifex Maximus will be in control of Israel as he directs worship of the Antichrist and the Temple is rebuilt. That’s what Chrislam is, and that’s what Chrislam was created to accomplish.

FROM ROME REPORTS: The UN’s Secretary-General, António Guterres, also tweeted his support for the “moment for reflection, hope and faith.”

This day is part of the Committee’s task to share the message of the Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together. The pope signed it in Abu Dhabi in February 2019 with the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar.

103,True,"The article presents a narrative that HPV vaccines are dangerous and ineffective, contradicting the mainstream view on the topic.",True,"The article mentions Diane Harper, a former vaccine research scientist for Merck, who is speaking out against the HPV vaccines.",True,"The article discusses the approval process for HPV vaccines, the safety trials conducted, and the reported adverse side effects.",True,"The article mentions the risks associated with HPV vaccines, including the reported deaths and serious side effects.",True,The article connects various events and information to argue against the effectiveness and safety of HPV vaccines.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"An expert involved in the approval process for the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix, is speaking out about the dangers and why you shouldn’t risk your child’s health in getting them.

Diane Harper, M.D., professor and chair of the department of Family and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Louisville, revealed at the 4th International Conference on Vaccination that HPV vaccines are essentially worthless, because rates of cervical cancer in the U.S. are extremely low anyway.

Her speech was intended to promote the benefits of vaccines, but she changed her mind and went in a different direction in an effort to “clean her conscience about the deadly vaccines,” according to The Daily Sheeple.

Dr. Harper, a former vaccine research scientist for Merck, said she wouldn’t be able to sleep at night unless she aired the truth about HPV vaccines.

In her speech, given in Reston, Virginia, she said that 70 percent of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment, and 90 percent do so within two years.

Over 40 young girls reported to have died from HPV vaccines

All safety trials for HPV vaccines were done on 15-year-olds, said Dr. Harper, and not 9-year-olds, the demographic for which the immunizations are now recommended. Furthermore, there is a real risk associated with these vaccines, she added.

More than 15,000 girls have experienced adverse side effects from Gardasil, according to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). A number likely to be far higher in reality, since many vaccine side effects go unreported.

At least 44 girls are known to have died from these vaccines. Some side effects experienced by those receiving the HPV vaccines include seizures, blood clots, brain inflammation, lupus and Guillain Barre Syndrome, a rare but serious autoimmune deficiency that causes the immune system to attack and damage nerve cells.

While the majority of those with GBS recover, the disorder may cause muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, paralysis and sometimes death.

As with most vaccines, parents are usually not made aware of the risks.

HPV vaccines work on only four of the 40 strains of the venereal disease

“About eight in every ten women who have been sexually active will have HPV at some stage of their life,” said Dr. Harper during her speech. “Normally there are no symptoms, and in 98 per cent of cases it clears itself. But in those cases where it doesn’t, and isn’t treated, it can lead to pre-cancerous cells which may develop into cervical cancer.”

Dr. Harper said that while Gardasil and Cervarix are marketed as protecting against cervical cancer, the claim has not been proven and is hypothetical.

Research conducted on the drugs show “there is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless,” she said.

Former Merck scientist attacked for speaking out about HPV vaccine dangers

“In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer. From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteorite.”

Her comments though brave, placed Dr. Harper’s reputation at risk. Big Pharma’s attack dogs quickly sought to destroy her, attempting to dismantle her credibility as a professional research scientist.

Since coming forward with her concerns about the HPV vaccines, a relentless and vicious campaign has been waged against her.

The former Merck scientist was made to look like a kook in an article published by The Sunday Express, a British tabloid, which heavily misquoted her.

Hoping to set the record straight, Dr. Harper clarified her position in an interview with CBS News, during which she said that HPV vaccines carry real risks while offering very little benefits.

She also added that reported side effects of the vaccine prove HPV vaccines are more dangerous than the cervical cancer its makers say it prevents."

In my first week in the House of Representatives in 1976, I cast one of the two votes against legislation appropriating funds for a swine flu vaccination program. A swine flu outbreak was then dominating headlines, so most in DC were frantic to “do something” about the virus.

Unfortunately, the hastily developed and rushed-into-production swine flu vaccine was not only ineffective, it was dangerous. Approximately 50 people who received the vaccine subsequently contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome, a potentially fatal form of paralysis. According to an expert with the Centers for Disease Control, the incidence of Guillain-Barré was four times higher among those who received the swine flu vaccine than in the general population.

That sad history may soon repeat itself.

Right now, governments and private industries are working to rapidly develop and deploy a coronavirus vaccine. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who is a major funder of these efforts, has suggested everyone who receives a vaccine be issued a “digital certificate” proving he has been vaccinated. Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose record of wrong predictions makes him the Bill Kristol of epidemiology, also wants individuals to carry some proof they have been vaccinated.

Another authoritarian proposal floated to deal with coronavirus is to force everyone to download a phone app that will track their movements. This would allow government officials to identify those who may have been near anyone who may have had coronavirus. Such mandatory “contact tracing” is an assault on our privacy and liberty.

Vaccines can improve health. For example, vaccines helped reduce the incidence of diseases like polio. But not all vaccines are safe and effective for all people. Furthermore, certain modern practices, such as giving infants multiple vaccines at one time, may cause health problems. The fact that vaccines may benefit some people, or even most people, does not justify government forcing individuals to be vaccinated. It also does not justify vaccinating children against their parents’ wishes. And it certainly does not justify keeping individuals and families in involuntary quarantine because they do not have “digital certificates” proving they have had their shots.

Islamic State militants have released footage claiming to show the beheading of British hostage David Haines. The aid worker, 44, was captured by ISIS in Syria in March 2013.

The plight of the dad-of-two was revealed when he appeared at the end of a video showing the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff earlier this month. ISIS had threatened to kill Mr Haines if world leaders do not bow to their demands.

The ISIS video begins with a clip of David Cameron. Here is a full transcript of audio from the video:

A man believed to be David Haines: “My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to declare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution.

“You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State just as your predecessor Tony Blair did following a trend amongst our British Prime Minsters who can’t find the courage to say no to the Americans’

“Unfortunately it is we the British public who will pay the price for our parliament’s selfish decisions.”

ISIS militant: “This British man has to the pay the price for your promise Cameron to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State ironically he has spent a decade of his life serving under the same Royal Air Force that is responsible for delivering those arms.

“Your evil alliance with America which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the haditha dam will only accelerate your destruction and playing the role of the obedient lapdog Cameron will only drag you and your people into another bloody and un-winable war.

The footage then shows what is believed to be the dead body of Mr Haines.

Another British hostage is paraded. The militant says: “If you, Cameron, persist in fighting the Islamic State then you like your master Obama, will have the blood of your people on your hands.”"

It suggests that intelligence agencies and other actors are involved in covert actions and propaganda to mislead the public.,"The shooting in Orlando, Florida, is not about homosexuals, or Muslims, or assault rifles.

It is about waging aggressive warfare overseas, empowering the domestic police state, and electing a warmongering President.

Dr. Graeme McQueen, founding member of the Centre for Peace Studies at McMaster University, Canada and author of The 2001 Anthrax Deception, argues that the prime suspects in any such case should be intelligence agencies.

We don’t have to go far to see the hand of intelligence agencies in this catastrophe. The shooter himself was an employee of G4S, described by journalist Alex Emmons as “a giant, often controversial global contracting corporation that provides mercenary forces, prison guards and security services.”

Additionally, the shooter’s father is said to be a CIA asset.

Given that Intelligence agencies are well-positioned to engineer synthetic terror threats, author Naomi Wolf argues that it is “crazy” not to question new events, since “spectacles” drive “outcomes”. Further, she observes that propagandizing the public includes films (i.e. “Zero Dark Thirty”) – arguing that the Pentagon must have “signed off” on it —which indirectly seek to “normalize” intelligence operations such as torture and mass surveillance.

Intelligence operatives know that synthetic terror events shock and anesthetize the public; that they make people susceptible to manipulation; and that they lay the groundwork for the terror event to be easily politicized.

Naomi Klein describes the same dynamic in The Shock Doctrine. When people are shocked by a real or man-made event, they can be easily manipulated to support wars, or neoliberal market schemes, or any number of toxic agendas.

The problem from the perspective of criminal warmongers is that the public doesn’t want war or a police state. The intended reaction of the operation is that the synthetic terror event will induce people to seek protection from the state, coupled with aggressive war to bomb the threat out of existence. The solution, or intended result, is already occurring. Engineered fear and racism have set the stage for the public to be manipulated to accept a covert agenda that it would otherwise reject.

Cui Bono? Who benefits? The police state apparatus, War Inc., and a warmongering Presidential agenda all benefit.

The manipulation of the public is further enabled by an amendment to the National Defence Authorization Act (NDAA) which negates the Smith-Mundt Act (SMA) of 1984 which prohibits government agencies from propagandizing domestic populations.

Susan Posel explains in “How the NDAA Allows US Gov to Use Propaganda Against Americans”:

The Broadcasting Board of Governors was created from SMA. This agency claims to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of ‘freedom and democracy’. They omit that their specialty is making sure propaganda is added to the informational flow we all depend on.”

Instead of succumbing to the shock of terror events, instead of allowing our “reptilian minds” to overrule rational decision-making processes, we need to decode the Orlando shooting, and other terror events, within the “problem, reaction, solution” framework, and be conscious of how they are being manipulated and politicized to suit covert agendas that do not serve the public interest. The “therapy” for the shock will allow us to subordinate our “reptilian” mindsets, and to act rationally. A rational mindset will reject the racism, hatred, and warmongering which are intended off-shoots of these terror events."

This supports the idea of secrecy in the alleged conspiracy.","Wikileaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange promised to release more damning emails about the Clinton Foundation, and warned he has enough evidence on Hillary Clinton making secret deals with an alleged Islamic State sponsor for the FBI to indict her. Asked by British journalist Afshin Rattansi on Saturday if he had “the email which will put Hillary Clinton behind bars,” Assange claimed to have 350 emails on a French transnational concrete company named Le Farge that allegedly paid ISIS to do business in regions controlled by the terror group. The report, by British political blog The Canary, showed the Clinton Foundation accepted upwards of $100,000 from the ISIS sponsoring company.

From 1990 to 1992, Clinton served on Lafarge’s Board of Directors. Under her tenure, Lafarge’s Ohio subsidiary was caught burning hazardous waste to fuel cement plants. Clinton defended the decision at the time.

Then just before her husband, Bill Clinton, was elected president in 1992, Lafarge was fined $1.8 million by the Environmental Protection Agency for these pollution violations. Hillary Clinton had left the board of Lafarge in spring, just after her husband won the Democrat nomination. A year later, under Bill’s presidency, the Clinton administration reduced Lafarge’s EPA fine to less than $600,000.

In the late 1980s, according to an archived investigative report in the American Spectator, Hillary Clinton was connected to Lafarge when the firm was involved in facilitating CIA support for Saddam Hussein’s secret weapons program.

Assange also spoke about Hillary Clinton’s close ties to Saudi Arabia.

“Saudi Arabia is probably the largest single donor to the Clinton Foundation, and you can see Clinton’s arms export policies when she was a secretary of state favoring extensively Saudi Arabia,” Assange said.

He also suggested Clinton had a reason for attempting to smear rival Donald Trump over his alleged ties to Russia: She has her own links she’s trying to conceal.

“There is a much deeper connection on record with Hillary Clinton and Russia than we are presently aware of with Donald Trump,” Assange said. “Hillary Clinton did quite well strategically to draw a connection between Trump and Russia because she has so many connections of her own.“

Senior Democratic officials see these email leaks as one of several curveballs that could swing the election, especially if they are released in October.

“We may be headed into uncharted waters, and this has the potential to spiral out of control,” veteran Democratic operative Jim Manley said.

Speaking at the Green Party convention on Saturday, Assange responded to criticism that Wikileaks has started to resemble an opposition research firm working to undermine Hillary Clinton, more than a non-partisan platform for whistleblowers.

“When we published the DNC leaks, the New York Times, which picked it’s favorite candidate … said that I intended to harm Hillary Clinton.”

“This is what we’ve been doing for 10 years,” he told the convention delegates via video feed. “It was a completely fabricated story.”

He told the convention that Wikileaks doesn’t target individuals — it’s all about publishing the truth.

“We are very interested in power and publishing the truth about power so people can work out however they choose so they can reform power.”

The numbers are at least in the hundreds of thousands at this point.

Every once in a while, a little piece of this trend rises to the surface and makes its way into mainstream headlines, if even at a local level as is the case with the recent news that the Richmond, California City Council which just passed a resolution “in support of the Space Preservation Act and the Space Preservation Treaty to permanently ban spaced-based weapons”.

Few societal threats escape the watchful eye of the Richmond City Council, so it was no surprise Tuesday night that it voted its opposition to airborne weapons systems that have allegedly targeted residents with mind-control technology. You read that correctly.

After a dozen professed victims told of pain suffered from chemtrails, particle beams and electromagnetic radiation, the council voted 5-2 in favor of Councilwoman Jovanka Beckles’ resolution “in support of the Space Preservation Act and the Space Preservation Treaty to permanently ban spaced-based weapons,” with Mayor Tom Butt and Councilman Vinay Pimple dissenting. [What unfortunate names…]

“I’m just a dumb city council person,” Butt said, “and this is way, way over my head. I frankly think it’s way out of the purview of what this city council should be taking up.”

Colleague Nat Bates was more understanding: “I’m going to support the resolution for the simple reason that we have voted on a lot of dumb ideas.”

With a population of nearly 108,000 people in 2013, Richmond is no small town… and this is just one example of one town in one state in our country where at least a dozen people felt the need to speak out about what they believe is happening to them.

While these council members can poke fun and make light of this, guaranteed the people suffering what they believe is never ending electronic harassment by the government don’t think it’s very humorous at all.

And the numbers of those people who do believe that appear to be growing exponentially.

The purpose of the Space Preservation Act of 2001, introduced by former U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, was to reaffirm it “is the policy of the United States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.”

The bill would have permanently banned all space-based weapons and the termination of testing and developing them. It further specifically defined “weapon” in part as a device capable of “Inflicting death or injury on, or damaging or destroying, a person” via “the use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations for the purpose of information war, mood management, or mind control of such persons or populations.”

It further noted that this would include “exotic weapons systems” such as electronic, psychotronic, or information weapons; chemtrails; high altitude ultra low frequency weapons systems; plasma, electromagnetic, sonic, or ultrasonic weapons; laser weapons systems; strategic, theater, tactical, or extraterrestrial weapons; and chemical, biological, environmental, climate, or tectonic weapons.

The bill, of course, got lost in committees and never passed. Not that our government would even bother to pass such a bill in the first place as a token gesture, but even if they had, considering most of the projects listed above are all like top secret or even above top secret military projects, it wouldn’t have been enforced anyway.

We only hear about some of the space weapons coming out now and then in the news or via the patent office, and guaranteed whatever we hear about, you know they likely have something years more advanced we have no idea about because the American public is on a need-to-know basis and long ago at least back to the late-1800s when they were developing and secretly testing electric airships, the government decided we don’t need to know.

We are currently being told microwave energy weapons are still a “conspiracy theory,” even as Boeing recently patented a Star Wars-style force field capable of “producing a plasma field between the target and the explosion using lasers, electricity and microwaves.”

However, the bottom line here is that so many American citizens are now publicly complaining of electronic harassment of various types at the hands of our government that city councils are being forced by their constituency to take up resolutions about it.

The truth cannot be buried forever."

According to debkafile’s Iranian sources, Tehran is preparing an underground test of a one-kiloton nuclear device during 2012, much like the test carried out by North Korea in 2006. Underground facilities are under construction in great secrecy behind the noise and fury raised by the start of advanced uranium enrichment at Iran’s fortified, subterranean Fordo site near Qom.

 All the sanctions imposed so far for halting Iran’s progress toward a nuclear weapon have had the reverse effect, stimulating rather than cooling its eagerness to acquire a bomb.

Yet, according to a scenario prepared by the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University for the day after an Iranian nuclear weapons test, Israel was resigned to a nuclear Iran and the US would offer Israel a defense pact while urging Israel not to retaliate.

As quoted by the London Times Monday, Jan. 1, INSS experts, headed by Gen. (ret.) Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel’s National Security Council, deduced from a simulation study they staged last week that. Their conclusion is that neither the US nor Israel will use force to stop Iran’s first nuclear test which they predicted would take place in January 2013.

Our Iranian sources stress, however, that Tehran does not intend to wait for the next swearing-in of a US president in January 2013, whether Barack Obama is returned for a second term or replaced by a Republican figure, before moving on to a nuclear test.

Iran’s Islamist rulers have come to the conclusion from the Bush and Obama presidencies that America is a paper tiger and sure to shrink from attacking their nuclear program – especially while the West is sunk in profound economic distress.

debkafile’s sources stress that both Tehran and the INSS are wrong: The Tel Aviv scenario is the work of a faction of retired Israeli security and intelligence bigwigs who, anxious to pull the Netanyahu government back from direct action against the Islamic Republic, have been lobbying for the proposition that Israel can live with a nuclear-armed Iran.

 Our Washington sources confirm, however, that President Obama considers the risk of permitting a nuclear-armed Iran to be greater than the risks of military action.

Monday, Jan. 9, top administration officials said that developing a nuclear weapon would cross a red line and precipitate a US strike. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta: “If Iran takes the step to develop a nuclear weapon or blocking the Strait of Hormuz, they’re going to be stopped.” He was repeating the warnings of the past month made by himself and Chairman of the Joint US Chiefs of Staff. Gen. Martin Dempsey.

As for Israel, Dennis Ross, until recently senior adviser to President Obama, reiterated in a Bloomberg interview on Jan. 10: “No one should doubt that President Barack Obama is prepared to use military force to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon if sanctions and diplomacy fail.”

 As for Israel, Ross said: “I wouldn’t discount the possibility that the Israelis would act if they came to the conclusion that basically the world was prepared to live with Iran with nuclear weapons,” he said. “They certainly have the capability by themselves to set back the Iranian nuclear program.”

Israel’s media screens and front pages are dominated these days by short-lived, parochial political sensations and devote few words to serious discourse on such weighty issues as Iran’s nuclear threat.

 This is a luxury that the US president cannot afford in an election year. Iran’s acquisition of a nuclear bomb and conduct of a nuclear test would hurt his chances of a second term. The race is therefore on for an American strike to beat Iran’s nuclear end game before the November 2012 presidential vote.

The INSS have also wrongly assessed Russia’s response to an Iranian nuclear test as “to seek an alliance with the US to prevent nuclear proliferation in the region.”

 This fails to take into account that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, running himself for a third term as president in March, has already committed Moscow to a new Middle East policy which hinges on support for a nuclear Iran and any other Middle East nation seeking a nuclear program. This is part of Russia’s determined plan to trump America’s Arab Spring card. source – DEBKA"

Should you ever find yourself in an emergency situation in a Western nation, you'd have a far better chance of receiving the best healthcare than you would in a developing country.



Because of this, we often overlook the fact that healthcare has become a multi-trillion dollar industry.

Today's mainstream medicine (or allopathy) thrives on treating sick people with expensive drugs, surgery, radiation, and even more drugs.

Many people may also not realize that the opportunity to capitalize on such a vastly profitable ecosystem was first recognized by the Rockefeller family.

In a world of Snopes and social media censorship, anybody who ever questions the motives of large pharmaceutical companies is immediately branded a ""conspiracy theorist.""

Information about the healing properties of unpatentable plants and holistic practices, or the dangers of Big Pharma drugs, is quickly branded as ""fake news.""

As with so many other things, citizens have been brainwashed into embracing what is harmful to them but profitable to someone else.

This opportunity was first realized by John D. Rockefeller (1839 – 1937).

Rockefeller was a robber baron, an oil magnate, a natural-born monopolist and America’s first billionaire.

He controlled 90% of all oil refineries in the U.S. by the turn on the 20th century, through his oil company, Standard Oil, which was later on divided up to become Chevron, Mobil, Exxon, etc.

Around the year 1900, scientists discovered “petrochemicals” and realized it was possible to create all kinds of chemicals from oil.

The first plastic, for example, was called Bakelite and was made from oil in 1907.

Scientists discovered numerous vitamins and assumed that many pharmaceutical drugs could be produced from oil.

For Rockefeller, this was an incredibly lucrative opportunity.

He realized that he could monopolize the oil, chemical and the medical industries, all at once.

Because petrochemicals were a new discovery, everything could be patented and sold for maximum profits.

But there was a fly in the ointment for Rockefeller’s plan to dominate the medical industry: herbal/natural medicines were very popular in the United States.

At the time, almost half of all doctors and medical colleges in the U.S. were practicing holistic medicine, using knowledge from Europe and practices used by Native Americans.

Rockefeller was a monopolist, so he knew he needed to get rid of his most significant competition.

To do this, he used the time-proven strategy of “problem-reaction-solution.”

This idea works by creating a problem to scare people, and then offering a (pre-planned) solution. (Similar to terrorism scare, followed by the “Patriot Act”).

To devise his scheme, he sought assistance from long-time associate, and fellow plutocrat, Andrew Carnegie, who had made his money from monopolizing the steel industry.

The prestigious Carnegie Foundation sent a man named Abraham Flexner to travel around the country.

He was tasked with reporting on the status of hospitals and medical colleges around the US.

This gave birth to the Flexner Report, which led to modern medicine as we know it today.

Naturally, the report declared the need for revamping and the centralization of medical institutions.

Over half of all medical colleges were soon closed following the report.

Homeopathy and natural medicines were demonized and mocked, with some doctors even jailed.

Rockefeller donated more than $100 million to colleges and hospitals to help with the transition and change the minds of other scientists and doctors.

Medical colleges were soon all streamlined and homogenized.

Students were all learning the same thing, and medicine only involved using patented drugs.

Scientists also received substantial grants to study the healing properties of plants and how they cured diseases.

But their job was to identify which chemicals in the plant were effective so a similar chemical could be recreated and then be patented.

""A pill for an ill"" quickly became a mantra for modern medicine.

100 years later medical colleges are churning out doctors who know nothing about holistic practices or the benefits of nutrition or herbs.

Corporations have enslaved an entire society for its ""well-being.""

The American Government spends 15% of its Gross domestic product (GDP) on mainstream healthcare.

The system focuses only on symptoms and not cure, creating a never-ended flurry of repeat paying customers.

There is no known cure for cancer, autism, diabetes, asthma, or even flu.

This is a system designed by oligarchs and plutocrats, not by doctors, so why would there be real cures?

Curing these profitable diseases would just be bad business.

And on the topic of cancer, the American Cancer Society was founded in 1913 by guess who..?

Comey did take a few slaps at Hillary, saying: “To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.”

But, ultimately, Comey concluded: “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.”

Herbicide exposure?

The Centers for Disease Control recently revealed they are investigating 155 possible cases of “polio-like syndrome,” or acute flaccid myelitis. So far, 80 cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) have been confirmed in 25 states, as of November 2, 2018.

While health officials say they “don’t know” what’s causing the outbreak of polio-like symptoms in children, there are a few potential causes that are going unreported: Vaccines, migration and exposure to toxins are all potential vectors of disease — but saying so isn’t “politically correct.” Scientists have long-since known that the oral polio vaccine can (and does) cause polio-like symptoms.

Further, the CDC’s own page on AFM notes that environmental toxins are another potential cause. The toxicity of agrochemicals like glyphosate, atrazine and other pesticides is well-documented, yet instead of addressing these issues, the CDC and the mainstream media are simply doubling down on their pro-vaccine rhetoric.

Ironically, the CDC itself is claiming that these AFM cases are not the polio virus, yet states that staying “up-to-date on your vaccines” will somehow help prevent this “mysterious” illness.

What is AFM, and why would it be caused by vaccines?

AFM is a polio-like syndrome that’s characterized by muscle weakness and paralysis. It is considered a neurological condition, which has degenerative effects on the central nervous system — specifically, the spinal cord.

So far, it has predominantly been affecting children and CDC officials say they do not know what is causing the uptick in AFM. “We don’t know what caused the increase in AFM cases starting in 2014,” the federal agency’s website states.

According to NBC, doctors say, “the pattern of the reported cases strongly points to a virus.” Experts reportedly say that the primary suspect is a distant relative of polio called enterovirus D68 or EV-D68.

But, are doctors neglecting the fact that the polio vaccine causes more cases of disease than wild polio? In 2017, NPR reported that vaccine-derived polio-like illness was far more common than wild polio.

“These cases look remarkably similar to regular polio. But laboratory tests show they’re caused by remnants of the oral polio vaccine that have gotten loose in the environment, mutated and regained their ability to paralyze unvaccinated children,” Jason Beaubien writes for NPR.

Raul Andino, a professor of microbiology at the University of California at San Francisco, told NPR, “We discovered there’s only a few [mutations] that have to happen and they happen rather quickly in the first month or two post-vaccination. As the virus starts circulating in the community, it acquires further mutations that make it basically indistinguishable from the wild-type virus. It’s polio in terms of virulence and in terms of how the virus spreads.”

Who is to say that this new “polio-like” illness is not the result of an unanticipated mutation? As NPR notes, the oral polio vaccine (the main driver of vaccine-derived polio) is still used in many countries around the world.

This is one way in which mass migration could be fueling the AFM epidemic: People who are vaccinated with the oral polio vaccine and then migrate to the U.S. could very well be spreading disease. Illegal immigration has long been indicated as a potential vector of disease for an array of reasons.

So while CDC experts say that AFM is not being caused by any form of polio, it could be possible that it’s not being caused by a form of polio they know of.

While officials are saying EV-D68 is a potential cause of AFM, sources say that just two of the initial 23 patients with AFM tested positive for EV-D68. If this virus was a driving force in AFM, one would expect more patients to test positive for it.

Scientists have yet to find a common thread in the onset of AFM among all patients, yet the left-wing media is bent on blaming some enterovirus that has apparently appeared in our environment out of thin air.

Could it be environmental toxins?

Another potential cause of the AFM outbreak is simple: Exposure to toxins. Whether we recognize it or not, pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers and other noxious compounds have become a fixture of our environment. Whether we are talking about DDT, glyphosate, or something else entirely, it seems as though our “health officials” have forgotten that these chemicals we are spraying on the food we eat (and into the air we breathe) are ultimately poisons.

It would seem self-evident that neurotoxins are cause enough for a neurological problem like AFM. And surely, the country’s best and brightest scientists are aware of this fact. Moreover, this outbreak of AFM reportedly began in 2014 — nearly four years ago. Does anyone really believe that after four years, the CDC still has “no idea” what is causing this problem?

When Brazil’s microcephaly crisis hit the world’s stage in 2016, CDC officials were almost immediately certain that it was caused by the Zika virus. It was later revealed, however, that this was a sham intended to cover-up the fact that the government had dumped a toxic larvacide into local water supplies.

The federal government may never reveal the true cause of this AFM outbreak to the public, but the CDC will probably come up with a vaccine for EV-D68 anyways."

Liberal actor claims those who support president have destroyed 'everything that matters'

Liberal actor Alec Baldwin has attacked supporters of President Donald Trump, claiming they have caused ""colossal destruction of everything that matters"" in America.

The far-left Hollywood star went on a rant Monday about the ""moral collapse"" of the United States, which he claims 63 million Trump-voting Americans are responsible for.

Baldwin, who has become best known for impersonating President Trump on ""Saturday Night Live"" in recent years, went on a Twitter tirade about the things he hates about America.

The anti-Trump actor, whose recent movie ""Drunk Parents"" scored 3.8 out of 10 stars in IMDB, put the blame for this so-called ""destruction"" in ""the lap"" of those who voted to ""Make America Great Again"" in 2016.

""American democracy has always been a struggle between the misaligned protections of specific freedoms and a raging, at times intoxicating, 12 cylinder economy,"" Baldwin whined to his social media followers.

""It demanded vigilant/consistent regulation, compassion for the disenfranchised and the periodic display of a necessary sacrifice that allowed for the long term health of our society at the expense of short term whims,"" he added.

""The desecration of those ideals and the near moral collapse of this country falls squarely in the lap of Trump’s supporters... as opposed to Trump himself, who is merely what psychology labels the 'objective negative function',"" Baldwin continued.

""Like fire, floods and earthquakes, it destroys, and only destroys, by its very nature.

""It is Trump voters, particularly those who would re-elect him who bear the blame.

""For the undeniable and colossal destruction of everything that matters to us as Americans that cannot be merely monetized.""

Baldwin's remarks garnered a mixed reaction from Twitter users, with most seeming to disagree with his comments.

One user accused the Hollywood star of ""having a meltdown"" while another suggested he may be suffering from TDS - Trump Derangement Syndrome.

Over the holidays, Baldwin dedicated one of his ""Christmas wishes"" to President Trump.

""I hope some of the BBQ sauce in Trump’s hair slides off, he trips and falls and can’t run,"" Baldwin tweeted just before Christmas.

Baldwin’s anti-Trump rhetoric has been a mainstay in his shtick ever since Trump rose to power.

In early December, he even took to Twitter to rally fans into impeaching the president.

American politicians are notorious for spreading mass fear and panic about infectious disease outbreaks, which they routinely blame on unvaccinated people. But what these same Big Pharma puppets conveniently fail to mention is that in places like Japan, where vaccination is entirely optional, children are actually much healthier compared to anywhere else in the world.

Japan not only has the healthiest children on the planet, according to the latest metrics, but also the highest “healthy life expectancy” among all age groups. And at the very same time, Japan also has the lowest vaccination rate in the entire world, which suggests that getting vaccinated actually makes a person unhealthier in the long run.

In the United States, on the other hand, more young children are dying compared to any other industrialized country, including Japan. More American children are dying at birth and in their first year of life compared to their counterparts living in any other country in the West – this, despite the fact that vaccination rates are increasing due to authoritarian mandates like those pushed by Richard Pan in California.

Of the American children that actually survive birth and make it past one year of age, more than half will develop at least one chronic illness throughout their lives – which isn’t the case in Japan, where chronic illness is a rarity. So it would appear as though getting vaccinated actually increases an infant’s risk of getting sick or dying, rather than the other way around.

“The U.S. government, in bed with Big Pharma, is sacrificing our children for profit,” writes Mac Slavo for SHTFplan.com.

Vaccines are harming and killing children – and yes, they DO cause autism

While many American states still recognize that parents have the right to exempt their children from mandatory vaccinations for religious, philosophical, personal, or medical reasons, there’s a big push to eliminate these exemptions across the board, and force everyone to be vaccinated for “public health.”

But does getting vaccinated with questionable vaccines like Merck & Co.’s MMR for measles, mumps, and rubella, really enhance public health? Hardly. As it turns out, there are multiple court cases pending in which whistleblowers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claim that Merck faked efficacy data for MMR to force it onto the market.

They allege that not only is MMR not effective, but it’s also not safe, as it can, in fact, increase a child’s risk of developing autism or some other permanent injury. In a worst-case scenario – and yes, it has happened – MMR can also cause sudden death.

Some public health officials are actually starting to fess up to this. In New Hampshire, for instance, it was determined that a recent measles outbreak wasn’t caused by unvaccinated children, but rather by a vaccinated child who had previously received MMR in accordance with government recommendations.

The MMR vaccine, in this instance, infected the child’s body with measles, which that same child then “shed” onto other children triggering an outbreak. At first, health officials used the scare as ammunition to push mandatory vaccination. But once it was realized that a vaccinated child was “patient zero,” the whole thing magically went away because it made the MMR vaccine look bad.

“What you won’t hear from vaccine advocates or the mainstream media, is that Merck is in court over MMR-related fraud,” Slavo adds.

“All of these risks involved with getting vaccinated are being covered up by government agencies (FDA and CDC) and the politicians simply don’t care. The vaccine industry is for profit and until safety and saving lives is more important than money, the government and Big Pharma will continue to sacrifice our children to line their own pockets,” he adds.

He says we need an economic expert, not a politician, to fix our severe financial problems. Dr. Kotlikoff explains, “Our democracy is in trouble. We have 14% of the electorate who have chosen Hillary Clinton for us to vote for, and a different 14% have chosen Trump to vote for. The vast majority of the population realizes neither Clinton nor Trump are qualified. Just on the economic front, these folks have no idea how fiscally sick our country is. The fact that we have off-the-book liabilities that make our true debt roughly 15 times larger than the amount the government is actually reporting, so, our true debt is about $206 trillion. The debt the Congressional Budget Office is telling us about is about $13.5 trillion. . . . We’re short $206 trillion. The country is 53% underfinanced. So, the country is actually bankrupt right this minute. It’s not $206 trillion in the future that we owe, it’s $206 trillion today. It’s our credit card bill, and we’re broke.”

Kotlikoff goes on to say, “So, if you put everything on the books, we’re broke, and we’ve been printing money out the wazoo since 2007 to pay Congress’s bills. That’s the truth about quantitative easing. We need to have somebody who knows what’s going on in the big picture here and has a game plan to get rid of this fiscal gap, and do it without total chaos. If we leave things the way they are, people will view the country as leaderless fundamentally and printing money to pay its bills. Then, the expectation will occur, and that’s going to raise rates, and that’s going to drop bond prices, and that will sink the banks, and, yes, you can have another great recession like Bill Gross is referencing (bond super nova). I’ve been saying this for decades. The time for the last straw to drop on the camel’s back, and when it’s going to drop that camel is hard to say. If you look at the fundamentals, and the fundamentals look like that of an emerging country, we are the most indebted developed country relative to GDP of any country around. We are in worse shape, I believe, than Russia or Greece, and far worse shape than Italy.”

This has happened many times before according to the Bible. Cahn contends, “Trump is following this pattern where a nation, as in ancient Israel, was about to really fall and falling away from God, he raises up an unlikely figure who is providing a window of time and holding back the flood. Trump is that person. It’s not about Trump . . . but he is now holding back, his Presidency is a window of time right now. At the same time, if he doesn’t get re-elected and Democrats get, in it’s a whole different ball game. Then that wall is going to come down and there is going to be a flood. In the time of the Trump presidency, we are watching a continual apostasy, a continual move away from God in every possible way. So, we are at a time of great polarization. The country is very divided, and Trump is a lightning rod of that division. One side will do anything they can do to get him out, and the other side is praying that he stays in.”

“Nothing is an accident,” says Cahn. His newest, soon-to-be-released book called “The Oracle” proves the existence of God through Bible prophecy and math. Cahn goes on to say, “One of the mysteries of ‘The Oracle’ is when God does something, it is exact times, and it even involves the birth of people. So, when the first American Cyrus is in power, President Truman, God brings forth the second American Cyrus. Donald Trump was born in the reign of Truman, the first American Cyrus, and his whole life is going to be linked to it. . . .Donald Trump follows this mystery in amazing ways. . . . Trump even quoted a quote from Cyrus (of ancient Persia). Truman never recognized Jerusalem, but Cyrus did (in the ancient world), and Trump is the one who did it. So, now, Trump is the only other one just like Cyrus did. He recognizes Jerusalem just like Cyrus did. He speaks about building a house in Jerusalem, an embassy, just like Cyrus did. Cyrus spoke about building a house in Jerusalem. And to put it all together, about the hand of God in our lifetime, here’s what happens. With Cyrus, there is this 70 year mystery. . . . The Bible says, and this is about Cyrus, a king rose up and allowed the Jewish people to return from exile after 70 years. Trump gave the Declaration of Jerusalem in 2017. . . . You go back 70 years and you get to 1947, the year Israel is voted into existence, the beginning of Israel. . . . Where does the 70 year period fall to the day? It falls on December 6, 2017, which is the exact day Donald Trump issues the Declaration after 70 years, according to the mystery to the very day.”

Cahn says, “We are in end times. . . . The God of the Bible, you hear about miracles. You hear about him moving history, and you say, oh, that’s the Bible. The God of the Bible is real, active now and present. ‘The Oracle’ is revealing the same God is behind everything. . . . Even the election had to take place at the end of 2016 because the 70th year was coming. So, Donald Trump had to be elected at that moment so the 70 year mystery could happen. That tells you how awesome it is, how real God is and how that’s affecting everyone’s life who is listening right now. That’s what ‘The Oracle’ reveals.”

“The Oracle” also delivers a message of “salvation,” which also means Yeshua or Jesus. Cahn says persecution is coming back just like in the beginning of Christianity, but there is also good news. Cahn says, “There is another mystery and that is the return of the people of God, and that means this–that the church or the people of God will also return to the state they were in in the beginning. What’s that? That’s the Book of Acts. That’s when the church was on fire, and it was revolutionary. It was radical, and it was changing the world. Those people who stand strong, and I call all of you to stand strong and don’t compromise. Stand strong and God will use you and make us like the apostles again. That’s the glory of it. The ultimate of this jubilee, who ultimately left his land and is coming back? Messiah. The King was separated from his kingdom and he’s coming back again, and we want to be right and ready for that day. . . .For those who say I wish I could live in Bible times, congratulations–you are!”

• Presented to the court “located documents” that “seem incomplete.”
• Submitted “summary documents” that “do in fact seem to contradict each other.”

The FBI’s handling of requests for documents related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, which had links to locations and venues in Sarasota County, is unacceptable.

We and anyone interested in knowing more of the truth about 9/11 are grateful that U.S. District Court Judge William Zloch has steadily sought to require the FBI to adequately search for, find and release to the court documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act.

In contrast, it’s troubling that the nation’s top law-enforcement agency would not only be intransigent but would submit documents with gaps and contradictions to a federal court. The fact that the documents sought are relevant to one of the United States’ greatest domestic tragedies compounds the concerns.

In September 2011, two independent reporters writing for BrowardBulldog.org reported that a family from Saudi Arabia, who lived in Sarasota County’s prestigious Prestancia development prior to September 2001, had connections with individuals associated with terrorism.

The report, reprinted three years ago by the Herald-Tribune, cited documents showing phone calls to the house were made by hijackers who trained in Venice to fly airplanes. The report also said the family was visited by people using a car licensed to Mohammed Atta — who crashed the first plane into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.

The FBI subsequently said the family was not “related to any threat nor connected to the 9/11 plot.”

Yet neither the FBI nor anyone else has explained why the family, closely related to a prominent Saudi financier, abruptly left its Prestancia home two weeks before 9/11 — leaving clothes in closets, food in the refrigerator and three cars in the driveway and garage.

Given the involvement of Saudi terrorists in the attacks, and evidence of Saudi financial support for them, the public deserves more than contradictory and incomplete information from the FBI.

The agency’s credibility in this matter is not helped by the fact that its investigation of the family was not reported to Congress or mentioned in the independent 9/11 Commission report.

In September and October 2011, the Broward Bulldog and reporter/editor Dan Christensen went to federal court to demand that the FBI release documents relevant to its investigation of the family. (Subsequently, Halifax Media Holdings, which includes the Herald-Tribune, and the Miami Herald filed “friend of the court” briefs in support of the plaintiffs.)

Judge Zloch, a Reagan appointee, has repeatedly ruled that the FBI is not complying with the Freedom of Information Act. The “gaps and consistencies” in documents provided to the court “underscore the need for a more thorough search,” Zloch wrote in an order issued Friday.

The judge went to the trouble of identifying specific search functions for the FBI to perform — citing the names, phrases and software to be used. Zloch gave the bureau deadlines, including one later this month, for conducting the additional search and submitting the relevant documents for his review.

It’s vital to note that it’s not known publicly whether the Saudi family had any role leading up to the attacks. But we do know, according to the FBI, that the family had “many connections” with “individuals associated with the terrorist attacks.” Yet, according to Zloch, the search conducted by the FBI “yielded no documentation” of the investigation.

“This alone moves the court to believe a further search is necessary,” Zloch wrote.

The judge emphasized that the efficacy of the investigation is not the matter before his court. At this point, Zloch wrote, the focus is on whether the FBI has submitted the documents required by federal law.

“Based on the limited information before it now,” Zloch stated, “the court is unable to glean the whole truth.”

The same can be said, unfortunately, for the nation as it relates to many things that happened before and after 9/11.

1. China wasn’t happy that Trump and pushed them into such a hard trade deal which hurt them financially. The Chinese not wanting to go to war then released the virus to crash the world economy so they could then buy up Stock, shares, currencies and Gold etc at cheap prices to get their own back.

2. Aliens are coming to finally say Gday and therefore the governments of the world needed to create a good reason that the public would believe to ground the worlds air traffic as they didn’t want to cause planes crashing into each other when our sky will be filled with flying saucers

3. It has long been known that the Governments of the world want a cash ban and everyone to use digital money instead, what a better way to do it than have people staying at home, ordering online and spreading rumours that the cash itself can spread the virus so don;t use it.

4.It has been widely talked about that the world is indeed over populated, what better way to cull the population down than releasing a virus that will kill off the most vulnerable off leaving the strongest gene pool remaining.

5. For a while it has been said that the first GFC was a small one and a bigger one was due, rather than have an angry population blaming their corrupt Governments and the Banks etc for stealing the peoples money yet again, what a great story if they can blame the GFC MK2 on the virus and let the real culprits get away scott-free again.

6. Huge paedophile networks were about to be exposed bringing down some huge public figures, celebrities etc etc, by diverting attention to the Virus the paedophile mess can all be swept under the carpet and who knows maybe a few big names may actually get Covid 19 and “die” in the process

7. To push the vaccination agenda by using fear tactics and cripple the population financially to the point where if you don’t take the vaccine you wont be able to fly on plane, use public transport or work in a public place again.

8. To distract the population while the roll out of the controversial 5G network rolls out blaming any deaths on the Convid 19 Virus rather than the microwaves from the 5G towers

9. To collapse the world financial system controlled by central banks and allow a new fairer system owned by the people to rise flushing out all the corrupt people in the process.

10. A virus from a Bat in a dirty market in China mutated and jumped species to a Human and then it just spread world wide and caused the world to pretty much shut down with no other agenda being played out in the background.

11. Russia and the Saudi’s caused the Oil price to plummet potentially sending many Shale Companies (aka Fracking Oil Companies) broke only days before the media was reporting on Covid 19 whilst this maybe good for consumers the knock on effect for the markets was devastating

12.The US military added the Covid 19 virus into the supply chain of the super potent drug that was manufactured in Wuhan China called Adrenachrome. Adrenachrome is a super powerful drug mainly used by Satin worshipers to get the ultimate high during the sacrificing ritual by terrifying children or animals, kill them and then drink their blood while this powerful chemical that is produced by the body is present making the hallucinations super powerful unlike any other. By attaching Covid 19 to the manufactured supply it would expose all the people who use it that also may be connected to the child abduction rings thus exposing them so they could be investigated or arrested.

13. Forced micro-chipping of the population, creating a digital ID for each person on the planet so they can be tracked and traced anywhere on the planet in real time using 5G technology. Through injecting of the COVID-19 Vaccine which everyone will be begging to take once this chaos is over the nano sized microchip will also be placed into each person.

Emissions from planes, called contrails, disappear quickly while chemtrails are thick and persistent. They also get wider as they linger in the air.

What is the purpose of these sprays? What possible justification could there for such frightening injections into the environment of dangerous toxic chemicals?

The reasons given by the government for the need for chemtrails are to control the weather and for global warming. How does that stack up against getting sick with cancer, Alzheimer’s, etc?

Edward Snowden, the whistleblower on the NSA, has revealed some details. Chemtrails began in the 1960s as a major part of a secret lab called Muad’Dib with Monsanto very much involved.

He said the chemtrails were not difficult to hide because they were disguised in commercial aircrafts as additives and that the chemicals released are very dangerous, even in minute quantities. He further says, The most dangerous thing is that although chemtrails are keeping the climate of the U.S. reasonably stable, citizens are bombarded every day with an invisible rain of carbon-laden molecules, and the effect on health is totally unknown.

The Environmental Defense Fund, The Royal Society and the Third World Academy of Sciences further promoted chemtrails, calling it Solar Radiation Management. They discuss an incident which occurred in 1988 as a result of weather control – a high pressure system stalled, winds circled and pushed air south over the Midwest. What resulted was a drought and heat wave which …cost $40 billion in damages and 5,000 to 10,000 deaths.

They admit they don’t know what the side effects would be of climate control, involving chemtrails, physically as well as socio-politically.

Dr. Russell Blaylock, extensive researcher and author, says the aluminum and barium in chemtrails effects the brain and have dire consequences from falling into the soil and water, causing cancer and other illnesses.

Barium stops the flow of T-cells, whose function is to destroy cancer cells. Basically, chemtrails help to destroy the immune system, making it much easier to contract cancer whose rates have soared along with the increase of chemtrails.

Dr. Whitaker, Board Certified Naturopathic doctor, urges everyone to avoid mainstream, processed food products at all costs, eat non-GMO foods and detox your liver at least once a month. Part of that toxicity comes from the polluted air we breathe from chemtrails.

Buying organic food is definitely very necessary and no longer really a luxury – it is vital to our very survival. However, food cannot be officially labeled organic if they are contaminated with air-borne toxins coming from chemtrails.

One solution is to grow food in your backyard or even on a balcony and cover it, making a greenhouse. Then you can have totally healthy, uncontaminated, organic food which also tastes much better too.

These solutions are great and much needed, even without chemtrails, but for now they are more of a stop-gap. The real answer is to eliminate the insanity of trying to control the weather with killer chemicals when we might not have anyone left to benefit from it. It’s like – the operation was a success but the patient died?

There may or may not be any real reason to control the weather; the global warming theory has been highly disputed and many scientists say there is actually a global cooling coming up.

If chemtrails in the air cause cancer and other illness, what reasoning could there be behind putting millions of people’s health at risk?"

Reports last week by “mainstream media” outlets that serve as propaganda outlets for Democrats and the Deep State claimed that a long-awaited upcoming report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz will clear all “Spygate” figures of any wrongdoing in their plot to undermine and depose President Donald Trump.

The New York Times, for instance, reported, “The F.B.I. never tried to place undercover agents or informants inside the Trump campaign, a highly anticipated inspector general’s report is expected to find.”

In addition, the paper claimed, based on ‘insider’ leaks:

The determination by the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is expected to be a key finding in his highly anticipated report due out on Dec. 9 examining aspects of the Russia investigation. The finding also contradicts some of the most inflammatory accusations hurled by Mr. Trump and his supporters, who alleged not only that F.B.I. officials spied on the Trump campaign but also at one point that former President Barack Obama had ordered Mr. Trump’s phones tapped. The startling accusation generated headlines but Mr. Trump never backed it up.

None of that is accurate, based on previous reporting from the paper.

Let’s recall, shall we, that the New York Times itself reported in January 2017 on the day of Trump’s inauguration that his office in Trump Tower was “wiretapped” (see a graphic of the Times’ print edition here).

At the time, the paper reported, “American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said.”

So, what does the phrase “intercepted communications” mean? It means spying. It means eavesdropping. Or, in old-school parlance, “wiretapping.”

Trump was right when, in March 2017, he accused former President Obama of having his “wires tapped in Trump Tower,” though, of course, he was pilloried in the press at the time.

Why aren’t more Americans upset at this blatant act of sedition?

In September, before the network completely succumbed to “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” CNN gleefully confirmed that yes, indeed, the Trump campaign was “wiretapped”:

US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.

The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump.

What’s amazing about this is that the Times could publish its January 2017 story, followed up by CNN’s confirmation, and now try to plausibly claim that an upcoming report from the DoJ inspector general will dismiss those previous allegations without questioning the IG.

So, were the earlier reports wrong? Were these media outlets being misled and if so, why aren’t they angry about it?

Or is this just more of the stinking, fetid swamp being the stinking, fetid swamp?

More likely than not, based on an anonymous NYTimes whistleblower’s claims earlier this month in the Free Beacon, the “paper of record” along with CNN were merely playing roles in January and September 2017, and the Times is merely playing a role now.

The fact is, all of this appears to be another smokescreen to cover for the guilty parties. It’s amazing that more Americans (and more American media outlets) aren’t outraged by the fact that a president (Obama) would allow a rival presidential campaign to be spied upon in the first place. That is unprecedented in our history (as far as we know).

But it’s even more amazing that the guilty parties are very likely going to get away with their overt sedition."
123,True,The article discusses a conspiracy theory about scientific misconduct and fraud in a CDC study regarding the MMR vaccine and its connection to autism.,True,"The article mentions several actors involved in the conspiracy, including Brian Hooker, Andrew Wakefield, William Thompson, Coleen Boyle, Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsop, Frank Destefano, and Julie Gerberding.",True,"The article describes actions of scientific misconduct, fraud, covering up data, and intentionally omitting information from the study.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to support the conspiracy theory.,True,The article suggests that there was an intentional cover-up and diversion of public attention regarding the vaccine-autism connection.,"On October 14, Brian Hooker and Andrew Wakefield sent an official and detailed complaint to the CDC and the US Dept. of Health and Human Services.

The devastating and explosive complaint concerns scientific misconduct in a now-infamous 2004 CDC study, which gave the MMR vaccine a free pass and concluded the vaccine had no connection to autism.

CDC whistleblower William Thompson was a co-author on that study, and on August 27 he admitted he and his co-authors committed fraud and covered up the vaccine-autism connection.

The complaint references a 5/24/14 phone call between whistleblower Thompson and Brian Hooker. The call was recorded.

Thompson references one aspect of the fraud, a group of children with “isolated autism,” who were at higher risk of developing autism after receiving the MMR vaccine—the true data on these children were intentionally omitted from the study. Thompson says to Hooker:

“…the effect [autism] is where you would think it would happen. It is with the kids without other conditions [“isolated autism”]…I’m just looking at this and I’m like ‘Oh my God….I cannot believe we did what we did…but we did [bury the data on these children]…It’s all there…It’s all there. I have handwritten notes.’”

Concerning the overall fraud he committed in the 2004 study, Thompson states, in another phone conversation with Brian Hooker, “I have a boss who’s asking me to lie…Higher ups wanted to do certain things and I went along with it. In terms of command, I was 4 out of 5.”

Thompson named several of those higher ups. They were his co-authors on the 2004 study: Coleen Boyle, Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsop, and Frank Destefano.

In other words, those co-authors were among those who wanted Thompson to commit fraud.

This is highly significant, because Destefano and Boyle are not merely researchers. They are also high-ranking executives at the CDC, in the area of vaccines—director of the Immunization Safety Office (Destefano) and director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (Boyle).

As the complaint states, Thompson wrote a note to the head of the CDC at the time (2004), Julie Gerberding. He was very nervous about a presentation he was due to make at a large Institute of Medicine vaccine-autism meeting.

Thompson wrote: “I will have to present several problematic results relating to statistical associations between receipt of the MMR vaccine and autism.”

Thompson was considering blowing the whistle, in public.

Gerberding never answered his note. Thompson did not make his presentation.

But we know this. After Gerberding stepped down as head of the CDC in 2009, she went to work for Merck, assuming the position of president of Merck Vaccines.

That was, of course, the vaccine at the center of the whole 2004 fraud at the CDC. The vaccine whose connection to autism was buried.

To say this merging of facts is explosive is a vast understatement.

But the major media, who will report and trumpet flimsy scandals with great enthusiasm, have instituted and maintained a total blackout on this one.

Can they begin to imagine what parents of children who received the MMR vaccine, and then developed autism, think and feel about all this?

Why has the corporate media that would eventually expose the 2009 scandal failed to inform readers today that the same corrupt interests are leading the Covid-19 response?

Amid Covid-19 hysteria – “real journalists” across the Western corporate media are shamelessly and eagerly fanning the flames of hysteria, panicking the public and ensuring both the government and corporate special interests that influence their policy remain firmly in control.

This includes the stockpiling at the taxpayers’ expense of drugs produced by big-pharma to allegedly fight Covid-19.

This story may sound familiar to some readers because the exact same scenario – albeit on a smaller scale – unfolded 10 years ago during the 2009 H1N1 “swine flu” outbreak.

In hindsight, the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of a “pandemic” was revealed to be the work of financial ties between the pharmaceutical industry and WHO “experts” whose advice paved the way for the “pandemic” designation and the hysteria-justified policies that followed.

Among the big-pharma corporations involved was Roche – who not only provided H1N1 test kits, but also its “Tamiflu” drug to government stockpiles.

Ten years ago – “real journalists” at media platforms like Reuters would even report that Tamiflu was later found to be ineffective and that the stockpiles where a waste of money. A 2009 Reuters article written by Kate Kelland titled, “Stockpiles of Roche Tamiflu drug are waste of money, review finds,” would note:

Reuters writer Kate Kelland falls short of mentioning Roche’s financial ties to WHO experts who designated the appearance of H1N1 as a “pandemic” helping pave the way for both public hysteria as well as Roche’s profits from it selling what was essentially a useless drug to government stockpiles.

The BBC – however – in their article, “WHO swine flu experts ‘linked’ with drug companies,” would report:

Roche was mentioned by name by the BBC (emphasis added):

Today, the same WHO and the same Roche are poised to once again both fuel and leverage public hysteria and once again fill government warehouses and acquisition orders with Roche products ranging from testing kits to vaccines and anti-viral medication.

So where is Kate Kelland of Reuters’ article reminding readers of what she reported on 10 years ago about useless Roche medications that somehow found their way in large quantities to government warehouses? Where is her article about medications that were never used and all done at the expense of Western taxpayers?

Instead, Kelland’s recent articles have focused on reinforcing the official narrative surrounding Covid-19 and justifying increasingly drastic measures taken to panic the public and implement emergency spending that will undoubtedly benefit pharmaceutical corporations like Roche all over again.

Did Kate Kelland of Reuters forget what she wrote 10 years ago? Or are we seeing a pattern where a complicit media covers up these facts to ratchet up hysteria, and reports on abuse, corruption, and scandals only after those involved have filled their coffers and removed themselves far from any prospect of accountability?

Either way – a much easier question to answer is – should we trust media platforms like Reuters – platforms that concurrently promote criminal wars and other forms of corporate abuse – to inform us in times like this – or should we assume that responsibility ourselves – researching first and foremost the conflict of interest and motivation that drive corporations, the media, and governments to fuel public panic and benefit from it?

We must look into the science and statistics ourselves – apply critical thinking and draw our own conclusions. Then – invest in individuals, organizations, and institutions whose activities are in line with what is really happening rather than what corporations want us to think is happening and what aligns best with their profits rather than our individual and collective public health.

Germans could soon be issued “immunity certificates” that would allow them to leave the country’s coronavirus lockdown earlier than the rest of the population if they test positive for antibodies to the virus.

States across Germany are in lockdown, with strict quarantines imposed in some parts of the country.

However, researchers at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig want to send out hundreds of thousands of antibody tests over the coming weeks that could allow people to break free of the lockdowns, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.

If the project is approved, the researchers will test 100,000 people at a time starting in early April, Der Spiegel said.

The tests are designed to detect whether a person has developed antibodies to the COVID-19 virus, indicating that they were at one time a carrier and may have built up immunity.

A positive test could allow the person to leave the lockdown while many positive tests could allow governments to ease restrictions in areas with “herd immunity.”

Gerard Krause, the epidemiologist leading the project, told the magazine that people who are immune “could be given a type of vaccination card that, for example, allows them to be exempted” from “restrictions on their work.”

Germany has one of the lowest COVID-19 death rates in the world, which some experts and commentators have said is a result of the extensive testing rolled out by Chancellor Angel Merkel’s government.

The United Kingdom has similar plans to roll out antibody testing to loosen its lockdown. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has ordered millions of at-home coronavirus testing kits that, if approved for use, could be sent to frontline workers over the coming weeks and sold in pharmacies and through online retailers like Amazon.

However, coronavirus testing has so far had mixed success around the world. Spain was recently forced to return tens of thousands of rapid coronavirus tests from a Chinese company after they were found to provide inconsistent results.

Some tests have also reportedly demonstrated false positives, detecting antibodies to other, much more common coronaviruses.

Scientists also remain unsure about the extent to which past infection with the virus can prevent reinfection and for how long immunity will remain."

Contrails are made 25,000' and higher and it's actually hard to see those planes, unlike the lower chemtrail jets. --Don Croft

""The easy way to tell the difference between a chemtrail and a contrail is to compare the observed relative sizes of the planes: chemtrails are spewed from 12,000 to 20,000 ft altitude, so you can see the planes easily with the naked eye; contrails are generally much higher and the planes are much harder to see--pretty simple, convincing distinction but good luck getting the frenetic Chicken Litttle chumps to settle down and think rationally about this stuff."" [EW July 2008] Tactical Orgonite Sales UK

A contrail is no longer than 5 or 6 times the length of the entire plane and will disappear almost instantly or within 10 seconds

Con-trails are naturally formed at high altitudes (30,000+ feet) when hot, humid air from a jet's exhaust is momentarily crystallized by contact with cold air. Con-trails quickly evaporate, lasting only a minute or so, as the ice crystals melt. It is the same reaction taking place when you see your breath in the winter. Con-trails are also reffered to as 'vapor-trails' and 'condensation-trails.'

You will see a trail behind a plane that only follows it for a , not the that go from with chemtrails.

You can see the difference between a contrail and chemtrail below:



 You can see plane and contrail on same flight path of chemtrail that went over 5-10 minutes before and is now dissipating to nothing due to CBs. Notice the short length of contrail compared to the chemtrail that went right across the sky.



 Same plane with contrail, and chemtrail below.



 The contrail plane. The chemtrail has completely gone by now due to the CBs and 18s. The black line is dust on the camera sensor!"

As people have become aware of the propaganda and pseudo-science batted around by the very companies that produce the vaccines, and the knowledge that the CDC had been covering up results for the MMR Vaccination and it’s links to Autism, it was inevitable that more and more people would begin to question whether they could trust what was being suggested to be pumped into the bloodstreams of their children.

Italy have stated they are attempting to tackle misinformation about Vaccines by making 12 vaccines mandatory for children who are using the state schooling system. The Independent reports:

The Italian government has made 12 vaccines mandatory for children attending school up to age 16 in an effort to combat what it characterises as misinformation about vaccines. The new measures followed an intense public debate over vaccines after a measles outbreak and political sniping over accusations that the populist 5-Star movement had emboldened anti-vaccine advocates. Paolo Gentiloni, the Italian Premier, told a news conference that the new rules aimed to combat “anti-scientific theories” that have lowered Italy’s vaccination rates in recent years. The government approved making 12 vaccines, including measles, rubella and chickenpox, mandatory starting this September for children attending Italian pre-schools through the second year of high school. Other required vaccines include tetanus, diphtheria, polio and hepatitis B.

Just last week we heard the news that Germany would begin fining parents who fail to take advice from their Doctor on Vaccines. Fox News reports:

Germany is set to pass a law next week that will require kindergartens to inform authorities if parents have failed to consult a doctor about vaccinating their children, with those who refuse advice subject to fines worth up to $2,800. The law, expected to take effect on June 1, comes as leaders across Europe move to tighten vaccination laws amid a spike in measles, chicken pox and mumps. By mid-April, German health officials had counted 410 measles cases compared with 325 total in 2016, BBC reported."

The initial portion of the interview went as expected and was filled with scores of examples of pharmaceutical and medical insurance company greed and abuse which has resulted in the deaths of untold numbers of patients. Then Dr. Day dropped a bombshell when, at the conclusion of the interview, she unabashedly stated that the global elite want to murder 95% of the population. I was shocked and my personal reaction, at the time, was to reject her statement as a gross exaggeration.

In April of 2009, I interviewed Dr. Rebecca Carley and medical researcher and author, Patrick Jordan, at the very beginning of the swine flu outbreak and both guests made very similar claims with regard to an intentional depopulation program by the global elite. In this particular instance, Dr. Carley and Mr. Jordan pointed to the, as of yet, undeveloped H1N1 flu vaccine from which they claimed would be the primary catalyst in depopulating world in a classic case of the cure being far worse than the disease. I thought Dr. Carley was incorrect as well.

From 2015-2019, I have investigated Ebola and Ebola treatments. Now, it is me that sounds like Dr. Lorraine Day and Dr. Rebecca Carley. The undoing of America’s overall health is going to come from bioterrorism. As we have seen in recent days, immigrants from Africa are weaponized as the illegally enter the country and they originate from countries that have a significant Ebola outbreak. The CDC must have a death wish, or they have an ulterior motive.

People ask me, “Dave, what is the endgame with the globalists?” It is unquestionably, bioterrorism. I have a friend, who is retired from FEMA and his specialty was counter-bioterrorism. Some of my present sources say the same. MOST OF MY KEY AND HIGH RANKING SOURCES SAY THAT WE ARE BEING SET UP FOR A MASSIVE BIOTERROR ATTACK AND THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THIS ATTACK WILL BE THE DEADLY EFFECTS OF VACCINES THAT BROUGHT TO BEAR AGAINST THE MANUFACTURED ATTACKS. THE ADJUVANTS AND VACCINES ARE DEADLY OVER TIME AND THEY REFLECT THE QUOTED REALITY OF KEY GLOBALISTS THROUGH THE YEARS. TAKE THE FOLLOWING AS A DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST TRANSHUMANISM-LOVING GLOBALISTS.

Will the Truth Set Us Free?

For the past four years, I have researched the following question: Is there a deliberate attempt on the part of the global elite to eliminate a substantial portion of humanity through the use of a bioengineered diseases and viruses and the more deadly accompanying vaccines?

As with any murder plot, whether it be a single homicide, or mass genocide, the deadly plot contains the same essential elements: (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) means, and, (4) opportunity. In part one of this series, both motive and intent are examined by presenting the words of the globalists themselves.

Through my research, I have discovered that the notion of creating and implementing an intentional and systematic depopulation scheme was not a new phenomenon. The global elite have long advocated for draconian population reductions over the past several centuries. For example, Thomas Malthus argued that the population growth, by the poor, inevitably outstrips food production and leads to a massive retaliation from Mother Nature (i.e., Malthusian Controls). His infamous “Malthusian Controls” which are taught to every first year sociology student, has become a cornerstone belief for many modern day globalists who advocate population control by any means necessary. This radical and dangerous idea promotes the unproven notion that the poor deserve to die because there are too many of them for the Earth to adequately support. Malthus believed that higher wages and welfare should be withheld from the great unwashed because he believed that these two factors would allow the poor to survive and exponentially breed, thus compounding the overpopulation problem.

Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, enthusiastically promoted the Malthusian philosophy in the United States as she stated “The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.”

Perhaps these were merely the musings of two twisted individuals which do not represent any type of central philosophical belief. Unfortunately the theories of Malthus, Sanger and other population control advocates did not die with them. As I discovered, this is a reoccurring theme contained within the personal words of several dozen global leaders."

Of course, the controlling interest of the magazine is held by the Rothschild family, who think of themselves as the legacy of the magazine. With this in mind, the Economist is operating as a quasi-propaganda arm for the banking empire and it is meant to prime the public opinion that the globalist agenda will implement.

CONTROLLING INTEREST OF THE ECONOMIST HELD BY ROTHSCHILD FAMILY In the magazine, on January 9, 1988, it was said that 30 years from now people in the United States, Europe and the Japanese along with others in countries that are rich, will be paying for shopping using the same currency. The price of items will not be shown in yen, dollars or the great British pound, but in one currency. This currency is going to be favored by shoppers along with companies as it would be a great deal more convenient than the different currencies of today.

DEA OF SINGLE CURRENCY STARTED BACK IN 1988 AND WAS CALLED OUTLANDISH The idea of a single currency back in 1988 seemed to be outlandish. One of the biggest changes to the world economy since the 70s has been that flowing money has taken over trade in goods as being the force behind driving the exchange rates. Due to the integration of the financial markets around the globe, the differences in national economic policies that are known to change the interest rates, big transfers of financial assets are made from one country to another.

The transfers are able to swamp the trade revenue flows in effect on demand and supply of the different currencies and so in the effect on the exchange rates. Telecommunications technology is continuing to grow in advancement and transactions are going to be cheaper and they will get faster. Thanks to economic policies that are uncoordinated, currencies are only going to get even more volatile.

THE CURRENCY UNION IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO RESIST

There is not going to be such as a thing as national monetary policy. The new currency supply would be fixed by a bank that was central. There would be a world inflation rate and thanks to margins that would be narrow, each of the national inflation rates would be in its charge. Countries would be able to use taxes along with spending by the public to offset any falls in demand that was temporary and would need to borrow instead of printing money to finance any deficit of the budget. There would be no recourse to the inflation tax, and so creditors and governments would have to judge borrowing along with lending plans a great deal more carefully than they do at present. This would perhaps mean a huge loss of economic sovereignty; however, trends that make a single currency appealing would take the sovereignty away.

Even if exchange rates were more or less floating, the individual governments would have policy independence checked by an outside world that was not friendly.NATURAL FORCES WILL PUSH WORLD TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION With a new century coming, natural forces are going to keep pushing the world into economic integration that is going to offer a broad choice to governments. They can choose to put up a barricade, or they can just go along with the flow. Preparing for a single currency is going to ensure there are fewer pretend agreements on policy and there will be more real ones. There will be active promotion of the private sectors use of international money along with any national money that exists. It would mean that people would vote using their wallets for a move that would end up as a full currency union.

Creation of a single global currency is also going to give a great deal of geopolitical capital to international bankers that have not been elected, and it could take power away from the people of nations along with government representatives. But the question is whether or not anyone wants international bankers to have a huge amount of power, politically, on top of a lot of financial influence and the amount of sway they already have in power. People today want to have more say in their own lives and they do not want policy dictated by bureaucrats and bankers.The Rothschild family is keeping a profile that is very low in the public eye.

However, they do still have many business operations, and these are spread out over a wide array of sectors. There is not any particular member of the Rothschild family seen on the richest list of Forbes, but the family is said to have control over more than 1 trillion dollars in assets worldwide. Therefore they do still have a voice that is strong over the entire geopolitical spectrum, and many see this as a hand that is hidden that manipulates events quietly in the background under a veil of secrecy."

Oh, sure, the fact that the NSA had been secretly and illegally wiretapping Americans since at least 9/11 was, by that point, mainstream news. But those “revelations” (which themselves were old news to conspiracy realists) were not enough to convince the dyed-in-the-wool coincidence theorists that the government was actively engaged in the electronic surveillance of everyone.

We conspiracy realists could (and did) talk till we were blue in the face about the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act and Stellar Wind and Room 641A. “The NSA is splitting off the internet trunk lines and running them into locked off server rooms, for crying out loud!” we shouted. “What more do you need to know?”

We talked to NSA whistleblowers like William Binney and Russ Tice. We learned about ThinThread and Trailblazer, and how mass collection of everything was ready and waiting to go before 9/11. We learned how the NSA was spying on high-ranking officials within the US government itself, including senior congressional leaders, high-ranking military generals, the entire Supreme Court, and even then-US Senator from Illinois and future President, Barack Obama.

We made note of the mainstream media’s own casual admissions of the power of the deep state’s spying tools. We observed how our phones are listening to us even when they’re “off.” How smart appliances will be used to spy on us in our own homes. How the FBI can go back and listen to a recording of any phone conversation you’ve had at any point in the past, even if you weren’t under surveillance.

“Big Brother is already here!” we warned. “1984 is today!”

And we were laughed at.

Fast forward to 2020, and now no one is laughing. Instead, everyone’s shrugging their shoulders: “Yeah, of course the government is tracking us. They have to! It’s for our own good!”

What would the secret government get out of it?

July of this year, President Obama signed into law an amendment to the Executive Order 13295, which redefines who can be quarantined and why. This does not bode well for a nation that could potentially face an Ebola pandemic. It smacks of pre-meditated bio-warfare and martial law on a nation’s own citizens. This means that any police officer or ‘health official’ can, without question, and on suspicion alone, quarantine someone simply for showing any sign of ‘respiratory illness.’ None other than the war-mongering Bush Administration, first put the order into place, originally meant to quarantine victims of SARS. Ebola just happened to be listed on the original executive order, too, signed by Bush. But now, with the exception of influenza, Americans can be detained for any health concern, including Ebola, even if it is not named as such. When you add to this the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) already has measures in place for dealing with an outbreak of a communicable disease which allows for the quarantine of “well persons” who “do not show symptoms” of the disease, then Americans need to pay some serious attention to what is happening to their civil rights. Furthermore, under the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, public health authorities and governors would be given expanded police powers to seize control of communications devices, public and private property, as well as a host of other Orwellian measures in the event of a public health emergency. There is only one infected person in Dallas for now, but 80 more are under surveillance by the CDC. What do you suppose our criminal government has planned for the other thousands of cities in the U.S.? The issue does not revolve around taking measures to prevent an outbreak in the nation; if done with the true, sincere intention of protection, then without infringing on civil rights, that would be OK. The issue is when power is exercised at a dictator level. …

Quick, somebody get me some psych drugs, I must be out of my mind to think the people who exported our industrial infrastructure abroad and then deliberately imploded the economy (after shorting it) would stoop so low as to import a pandemic (real or imaginary) just to justify a police state takeover.

The fact is you don’t have to speculate about any of this. Just ask yourself what they expected to happen when americans figure out how they’ve been sold down the river. Is it possible they didn’t think about the likely fallout from the banksters’ wholesale looting of the country?

No. Sorry, it’s not possible. AT ALL. Wishful thinking and implausible deniability aside, they know exactly what they’re doing. It’s as plain as the nose on your face. They profited handsomely while they looted and they are well positioned to profit even more when people are desperate to sell everything they own just to stay alive. They are criminals and criminals will do anything to stay on top, because they know that if they slip, they’ll be hanging from a rope."

According to LifeSiteNews, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association say that doctors have uncovered evidence of a mass sterilisation program sponsored by the Kenyan government and funded by Bill Gates.

The Kenyan government denies there is anything wrong with the vaccine, and says it is perfectly safe.

The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, however, saw evidence to the contrary, and had six different samples of the tetanus vaccine from various locations around Kenya sent to an independent laboratory in South Africa for testing.

The results confirmed their worst fears: all six samples tested positive for the HCG antigen. The HCG antigen is used in anti-fertility vaccines, but was found present in tetanus vaccines targeted to young girls and women of childbearing age. Dr. Ngare, spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released November 4:

“This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.” (Source)

Dr. Ngare brought up several points about the mass tetanus vaccination program in Kenya that caused the Catholic doctors to become suspicious:

Dr. Ngare told LifeSiteNews that several things alerted doctors in the Church’s far-flung medical system of 54 hospitals, 83 health centers, and 17 medical and nursing schools to the possibility the anti-tetanus campaign was secretly an anti-fertility campaign.

Why, they ask does it involve an unprecedented five shots (or “jabs” as they are known, in Kenya) over more than two years and why is it applied only to women of childbearing years, and why is it being conducted without the usual fanfare of government publicity?

“Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children.” said Dr. Ngare.

But it is the five vaccination regime that is most alarming. “The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.”

UNICEF: A History of Taking Advantage of Disasters to Mass Vaccinate

It should be noted that UNICEF and WHO distribute these vaccines for free, and that there are financial incentives for the Kenyan government to participate in these programs. When funds from the UN are not enough to purchase yearly allotments of vaccines, an organization started and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI, provides extra funding for many of these vaccination programs in poor countries.

Also, there was no outbreak of tetanus in Kenya, only the perceived “threat” of tetanus due to local flood conditions.

These local disasters are a common reason UNICEF goes into poorer countries with free vaccines to begin mass vaccination programs.

Health Impact News reported last year that UNICEF began a similar mass vaccination program with 500,000 doses of live oral polio vaccine in the Philippines after a Super Typhoon devastated Tacolban and surrounding areas. This was in spite of the fact there were no reported cases of polio in the Philippines since 1993, and people who have had the live polio vaccine can “shed” the virus into sewage systems, thereby causing the actual disease it is supposed to be preventing.

A very similar mass vaccination with the live oral polio vaccine occurred among Syrian refugees in 2013, when 1.7 million doses of polio vaccine were purchased by UNICEF, in spite of the fact that no cases of polio had been seen since 1999. After the mass vaccination program started, cases of polio began to reappear in Syria.

It seems quite apparent that UNICEF and WHO use these local disasters to mass vaccinate people, mainly children and young women. Massive education and propaganda efforts are also necessary to convince the local populations that they need these vaccines. Here is a video UNICEF produced for the tetanus vaccine in Kenya. Notice how they use school teachers and local doctors to do the educating, even though the vaccines are produced by western countries."

Pollute the skies, collapse the ecosystem and starve everybody to death

Bill Gates has been hounded for years by allegations that he is a strong supporter of depopulation. Despite being praised by some as a philanthropist and humanitarian, the reality is that Gates’ actions have proved time and time again that he is actively invested in reducing the global population by whatever means necessary.

As reported by True Activist, Gates has repeatedly expressed his approval for global depopulation and has funded sterilization programs; has pushed for widespread vaccination programs which have caused great harm; and believes in the implementation of so-called “death panels,” which would allow authorities to decide whether someone is worthy of receiving taxpayer money to keep them alive, or if they should rather be “allowed” to die.

Gates’ latest scheme is perhaps his most daring – and likely most dangerous – to date. As reported by Big League Politics (BLP), Gates is funding a study by researchers from Harvard University which hopes to prove that dumping millions of tons of chalk dust into the atmosphere every day could dim the sun, thereby fighting climate change. (Related: Bill Gates to roll out remote control microchip-based sterilization of women.)

As explained by BLP, Gates and the Harvard team got the idea for their research from a natural disaster that hit the Philippines in 1991, when Mount Pinatubo exploded:

The disaster killed over 700 people and displaced hundreds of thousands of Filipinos, but the fall-out caused ideas to spring about in the minds of scientists.

A chemical cloud was left in the stratosphere following the blast, which resulted in the discharge of 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide. Sulfuric acid rained down afterward for more than a year and reflected sunlight, which resulted in the eventual development of SCoPEx [The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment].

The Gates-funded plan will essentially replicate the aftermath of the volcano blast throughout the entire Earth if the Harvard scientists are ultimately successful in their climate-manipulation plans.

The team’s plan involves using 800 massive aircraft to dump the chalk 12 miles above the surface of the Earth each day, claiming that the shade created would reflect the sun’s rays, thereby preventing global warming.

The scientists are eager to start experimenting and plan to launch their first round of chalk-bearing planes in the New Mexico desert. The initial SCoPEx experiment will cost around $3 million and will involve dumping a small quantity of calcium carbonate dust into the atmosphere and measuring the results.

Not everyone is eager for the experiments to begin, however, and authorities have called a halt over fears that the research could backfire and cause natural phenomena like droughts and hurricanes. (Related: Bill Gates and George Soros fund Monsanto and a world depopulation agenda.)

Eminent scientists have expressed grave concerns about Gates’ scheme. United Nations climate policy adviser Janos Pasztor warns, “If you make use of this technology and do it badly or ungoverned, then you can have different kinds of global risks created that can have equal, if not even bigger, challenges to global society than climate change.

“Governments need to engage in this discussion and to understand these issues,” he added. “They need to understand the risks — not just the risks of doing it, but also the risks of not understanding and not knowing.”

One clear risk of blotting out the sun is interfering with the process of photosynthesis, without which plant and food crops could not survive and all human and animal life would be endangered.

But then, perhaps that is exactly what Bill Gates, depopulation believer, is hoping for?

Over the past month, impeachment has been the word of the day in the media and among the progressive socialists (Communists!). The so-called impeachment inquiry that has not allowed the House of Representatives to vote for its implementation has degraded to a soviet Beria type of search for a crime.

It is an investigation in search of a crime. It has become a tyrannical show trial by Adam Schiff, a highly contemptible legislator with his own ties to Ukrainian oligarchs. Schiff has ignored the rule of law and has shown his ignorance in disavowing the provisions traditionally followed in the impeachment process. Schiff has no conscience when it comes to lying, even going as far as making up a statement that was a total lie and reading his lies at a House of Representatives that was in millions of homes in the country.

Adam Schiff has become an egomaniac obsessed with no other purpose but to get President Trump out of office. The two years wasted on the bogus Mueller collusion investigation would not have gone as long as it had. The people of our country would not be a house divided without Schiff constantly declaring that he had incontrovertible evidence of the Trump-Russia collusion. He lied. Schiff lied then, and he is lying now.

The transcript shines a light on the corruption in Ukraine and our country.

It is not being mentioned that President Trump was inquiring about Crowdstrike and the ties with the 2016 election. Crowdstrike was the same company that did the forensics for the DNC that claimed that it was the Russians that hijacked the election. It must be understood that the intelligence agencies in our country never did any investigation on the server because the DNC refused to turn it over to the intelligence services. This was the basis for the entire collusion narrative. Even today, there is no evidence of Russia hacking the DNC.

A corrupt press is taking part in the impeachment push.

The talking heads who are nothing more than a cadre of progressive socialists and an adjunct part of the Democrat Party have blared forth a continuing barrage of innuendo and talking points leaked by Adam Schiff. Once again, we are back to “bombshells” breathlessly reported by the press, which are later debunked by facts. They all talk to President Trump being a liar, a racist, and a lawbreaker. Turn on any fake news show, and you will see the false outrage that they want the American people to believe.

The whistleblower is more informant than a whistleblower.

The impeachment is predicated on written testimony from a CIA based entity, who worked with Joe Biden, and spoke to Adam Schiff before filing this report. Adam Schiff lied about this as well. He is being called a “whistleblower” to assure that he has protection for his actions. A great deal of what he has stated has been debunked, but the progressive socialist media will continue to push this charade as long as it can. Statements like the President asked eight times for an investigation into the quid pro quo of the Bidens, which proved to be false. After President Trump released the transcript, Schiff then changed his talking point.

Adam Schiff then claimed the quid pro quo was there, and after that was shown to be a lie, Schiff than changed his story again, claiming no quid pro quo was needed for impeachment. Every time the braying Adam Schiff blurts out another lying statement for the adoring press it has been proven to be misleading, and in many cases, as a totally fabricated lie. It is Schiff that now wants the informant to give his testimony in writing. This precludes cross-examination. And when that failed, he stated he refuses to let the informant testify at all.

Chuck Schumer has pushed the narrative that the whistleblower must remain unknown because President Trump has said that he has the right to “confront his accuser”. What President Trump said was that he has the right to “meet” his accuser. The use of the word “confront” by Schumer is just another lie being used to paint President Trump as unstable and easily angered."

It is also reported that Clinton herself may also be interview by the head of the FBI, James Comey. Comey is taking point on the Clinton investigation. This is not the first time Comey has been a part of an investigation into the Clintons. Early in his career, Comey was part of the Whitewater case. Time Magazine reports, “Comey and his fellow investigators concluded, (What the Clintons did) . . . ‘constituted a highly improper pattern of deliberate misconduct.” Comey is a former top federal prosecutor, and I think this case is far from closed.

Meanwhile, most of the mainstream media (MSM) continues to ignore or underplay this story. How the Democratic frontrunner involved in a massive investigation, with 150 agents that is being led by the head of the FBI, is not a story that should be reported on, is too stupid to be stupid. The MSM is trying to shield Clinton because they have ceased being news organizations. Instead, with the exception for a few outlets, they are nothing more than political spin organizations. They promote the ridiculously good stories and cover up fraud and crime like it’s not happening. And when it comes to coverage of Donald Trump, it is one negative story after another. This is an attempt to keep the “Criminal Crony Class” in power for both parties that keep sucking the blood out of America.

There are more reports out this week about how the Pentagon is helping Kurdish fighters against CIA backed ISIS and al-Qaeda fighters. This, only months after famed journalist Seymour Hersh broke the story late last year on how the Pentagon secretly passed intelligence information to help the Assad regime against ISIS. You cannot make this up. On top of that, the Iraqi army is coming to a standstill against ISIS in Mosul. So much for ISIS being junior varsity or weak. Finally, the Obama Administration has admitted that what ISIS is doing in the Middle East is genocide.

The Fed continues to talk down the possibility of raising interest rates despite claiming it would raise rates four times this year. Fed Head Janet Yellen is out again this week, and basically told Wall Street that the Fed has their back. The Fed knows if it raises rates, the very weak economy will tank. The Fed cannot raise rates unless it wants to crash the economy. It is that simple.

The BBC reports that at least three 5G towers were set alight within the last week, and police and fire services were called to extinguish the flames.

“I’m absolutely outraged and disgusted that people would be taking action against the infrastructure we need to tackle this emergency,” said Stephen Powis, the National Health Service (NHS) director, at a daily UK coronavirus briefing. Police have now launched investigations into how the 5G towers caught fire.

Rumors and conspiracy theories over a link between the roll out of 5G and the spread of coronavirus have been spread primarily through social media networks. A variety of groups exist on Facebook and Nextdoor, where thousands of members repeat false and misleading claims that 5G is supposedly harmful.

One theory claims that the novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan because the Chinese city had recently been rolling out 5G. It’s now supposedly spread to other cities that are also using 5G. These false conspiracy theories neglect to mention that a highly contagious virus would naturally spread more in densely populated cities with access to 5G, and that the coronavirus pandemic has hit counties like Iran and Japan where 5G isn’t in use yet.

There is no scientific evidence that links the coronavirus pandemic to 5G, nor any immediate negative health effects to 5G. Full Fact, an independent fact checking charity in the UK, has explored the claims after a British tabloid newspaper highlighted them recently. 5G uses a higher frequency of radio waves than 4G or 3G, but regulators in the UK have recorded 5G electromagnetic radiation levels well below international guidelines.

This hasn’t stopped these wild conspiracy theories from spreading, though. Some people are even harassing workers laying fiber optic cables for 5G installations, claiming that when 5G is turned on it’s going to “kill everyone.”

Mobile networks are classified as critical national infrastructure in the UK, but one Facebook group was specifically set up to encourage people to burn 5G towers. Peter Clarke, a mobile networks infrastructure expert in the UK, reported the group to Facebook but the company initially failed to remove it. After an increase in attention, the group has since been removed, but many others are still available with false information and thousands of people encouraging others to burn 5G towers down.

UK regulator Ofcom also warned Uckfield FM, a community radio station, this week for featuring someone with “potentially harmful statements about the coronavirus.” A guest, identified as a “registered nurse,” appeared in a 20-minute segment in February, claiming that 5G is sucking the oxygen out of people’s lungs. The segment also spread the falsehood that 5G and coronavirus are linked. Clips of the radio show have been widely shared on Facebook ever since."

But there was no mention of any change in policy was mentioned in A routine statement from the U.S. Central Command issued Wednesday

“Operation Roundup, which began May 1 to defeat ISIS in the Middle Euphrates River Valley and Iraqi- Syrian border region, has continued to gain ground and remove terrorists from the battlefield through offensive operations coupled with precision Coalition strike support,” the statement said.

“Operation Roundup will continue to target ISIS as the Coalition remains committed to the lasting defeat of ISIS to increase peace and stability in the region, and to protect all our homelands from ISIS's terrorist threat.”

The report doesn't mention U.S. and Coalition air forces in the region, who have also been assisting U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.

The Washington Examiner reported the U.S. recently established observation posts in northeastern Syria in a move the convince NATO ally Turkey that there was no threat from some members of the Kurdish YPG, which Turkey has labeled terrorists.

Trump on Wednesday morning alluded to the move, tweeting, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.""

An earlier report from the Wall Street Journal said the U.S. military was preparing to withdraw its forces from northeastern Syria, following a call last week between President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Erdogan this week threatened to launch an assault on Kurdish troops backed by the U.S.

According to one recent intelligence study: ""The prospect of US being militarily involved in Syria, caught in the middle of one of most complex conflicts in recent memory, with shifting objectives & ambiguous endgame, has been met with congressional indifference and public apathy.""

Early Saturday morning, Jan. 3, Day 8 of Israel’s Gaza operation, US and British media described the Israeli invasion as hours away.

In his weekly radio address – brought forward by a day, the US president spoke with exceptional firmness: “Another one-way ceasefire that leads to rocket attacks on Israel is not acceptable,” he said. “This recent outburst of violence was instigated by Hamas – a Palestinian terrorist group supported by Iran and Syria that calls for Israel’s destruction.”

He noted that “Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in a coup and routinely violated an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire…” and went on to define the exit point for Israel’s military operation:

“Promises from Hamas will not suffice,” he said. There must be “monitoring mechanisms in place to help ensure that smuggling of weapons to terrorist groups in Gaza comes to an end.”

This left Israel the option of sustaining its military activity against Hamas until such a mechanism was installed. He implicitly criticized Egypt for failing to control the smuggling of rockets and other munitions through its territory.

In his radio address, President Bush noted that president-elect Barack Obama is being kept up to date on the latest developments. With just over two weeks left in power, the Bush administration is preparing to hand over the problem to his successor.

2. Hamas’ conduct Friday: After 9 Grad Katyusha rockets were fired against Ashkelon, destroying two buildings and injuring five Israelis, the tempo slowed to 40 launchings the whole day – half the week’s daily average. The Palestinian terrorists were evidently reserving stocks for a grand climax when Israeli tank and armored infantry crossed into Gaza.

3. Hamas threats have mounted to a new pitch: Damascus-based Khaled Meshaal, who is in hiding, warned Israel (in a taped speech) of a “black fate” if it invades Gaza, including more kidnapped Israeli soldiers. Underlying his words was the threat of guerrilla action behind Israeli lines to snatch hostages.

4. Israeli air strikes against the empty homes of Hamas leaders continued early Saturday after 45 were destroyed Thursday and Friday. Their objective is to demoralize the Hamas command echelon and break its will to fight.

5. The Hamas military wing reported thwarting an Israeli special forces’ attempt to steal into the Sejaya refugee camp in Gaza City early Saturday. This is the third such claim in three days. The IDF spokesman denied knowledge of the incident.

6. DEBKAfile’s military sources report mass-desertions by teenagers who form the backbone of Hamas’ fighting rank and file. They are going home to their parents.

7. Early signs that former Palestinian security officers unaffiliated with Hamas are getting together to seize control of Gazan districts in which Hamas rule has collapsed.

Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets from Friday night advising people living in the northern and eastern neighborhoods of Gaza City to leave their homes. Defiance of this curfew directive carried the risk of being shot.

8. Cairo forwarded an urgent request to Hamas leaders in Damascus to make known their conditions for a ceasefire.

9. The arrival in Damascus of the chairman of Iran’s national security council and nuclear negotiator Said Jalili for urgent talks with Syrian president Bashar Assad and the leaders of Hamas and Jihad Islami.

Bush’s speech followed his conversations with Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Saudi leaders as well as Olmert. He said he was concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza and noted that “Hamas terrorists often hide within the civilian population which puts innocent Palestinians at risk.”"

He is pastor to The Way of Yah congregation located in Georgia. The black Hebrew Roots Movement is like pharisaical holiness on steroids with replacement theology and racial superiority stamped right in the middle of their rebel flag. Unlike other false teachers such as Joel Osteen and Creflo Dollar, Tony Smith has a smooth, authoritative preaching delivery with pretext-based heresies that can easily deceive and slay new born babes in Christ.

“For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.” Titus 1:10,11 (KJV)

As the scriptures saith, the devil’s ministers appear as ministers of righteousness. It is no surprise that the devil’s preachers appear near spotless on the outside before letting the light of God’s holy words expose their ravenous fangs. I have heard a lot of Smith’s preaching throughout the last several years. I have never seen a heretic go from heresy to outright blasphemy in the pulpit at such a fast rate. Five years ago, Pastor Smith believed that salvation must be received through water baptism; but now, Smith has regressed to outright blasphemy by proclaiming that the name Lucifer is really Jesus!

Isaiah 8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

There is nothing new under the sun. Heretics like Pastor Tony Smith ultimately reach such blasphemous forms of heresy by first rejecting God’s commandment to rightly divide the word of truth. They then reject all Pauline epistles as doctrine for the body of Christ. Finally, they pervert all Old Testament promises to the Jew by stealing and applying them to the church, black Hebrews, Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah Witness, and all other cults.

The Apostle Paul continuously warned the body of Christ about false teachers coming out from among the flock. Tony Smith is no Sabbath keeping, temple worshipping, law keeping Jew. Even if he was, he false teachings still do not override what the Apostle wrote through the power of the Holy Spirit.

“I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool ) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers,in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, inperils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.” 2 Corinthians 11:16-28 (KJV)

Tony Smith teaching that you have to be a Jew to be saved:

“For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.” Romans 10:12 (KJV)

“And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.” Acts 11:26 (KJV)

Tony Smith attacks the King James Bible and the Apostle Paul:

“Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?” Ecclesiastes 8:4 (KJV)

“And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.” 2 Peter 3:15,16 (KJV)"

CNN is blaming America’s Mojave and Sonoran Deserts – which have existed for thousands of years – on “global warming.”

Despite the Mojave’s Death Valley experiencing a record temperature of 134 °F in 1913, the network claimed the American Southwest’s current “record-breaking heatwave,” “raging wildfires” and “power outages” were due to “man-made climate change.”

At least two of those can be largely blamed on California’s byzantine state government, however.

“If you’re stranded in Phoenix right now, or worried about an elderly acquaintance in California, or are without power in the Bay Area, or nervous about a wildfire taking your home, you can thank the long list of politicians who do the bidding of polluting corporations instead of their constituents and protect profit over the environment,” CNN’s Jill Filipovic wrote. “You can thank the President who tore up the Paris climate agreement.”

But most of those are local or state-level issues that have existed before the establishment started fueling the whole “man-made climate change” narrative, and all of those areas – including Phoenix – are Democratically-run.

Remember the 2000 California electricity crisis that was largely blamed on collusion between energy companies and state politicians “gaming the system?” The scandal would likely have never been exposed if the “climate change” rhetoric was as loud then as it is today.

And that’s a good point: politicians use “global warming” as the boogeyman to hide their power grabs.

Furthermore, did Trump’s rejection of the Paris climate accord magically heat up the globe immediately with the stroke of his pen?

Of course not, and in fact, if it was intended to actually stop “global warming,” the accord wouldn’t have exempted India and China, two rapidly growing economic superpowers, from major regulations.

The Paris climate accord was designed to weaken the US economy and make Americans dependent on global government, like vassals of a distant empire.

If multinational banks are to control America, they can’t let her remain economically independent.

Additionally, a wrath of wildfires in California blamed on “global warming” was found to be arson.

“Many of the problems facing California are self-inflicted from decades of fire suppression, a naturally occurring drought, and mismanagement of water resources,” Climate Depot’s Marc Moreno pointed out. “While some have tried to blame global warming, studies keep disproving their alarmist rhetoric.”

The Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986 bathed much of Europe in toxic, deadly radioactive isotopes. Yet the Soviet government covered it up, at first claiming no accident had taken place at all. Even after the government was fully informed of the horrifying scope of the disaster, they covered it up and ultimately condemned potentially millions of people to an early death.

The United States government is doing exactly the same thing when it comes to vaccines. Toxic vaccines — made with neurologically-damaging ingredients like aluminum, mercury, squalene, MSG and formaldehyde — are causing widespread injury to children, even according to official government statistics. As autism rates skyrocket and children are sometimes paralyzed, hospitalized or even killed by vaccines, the U.S. government covers it up just like the Soviet government did with Chernobyl.

Even as citizens are maimed and killed, the government buries the truth. This effort is spearheaded by the CDC, which has become the “vaccine deep state” — a front for Big Pharma’s malicious agenda to profit from human suffering by selling unsafe vaccines (and pushing pro-vaccine propaganda everywhere).

It’s the CDC that demanded all the tech giants ban every website, channel or voice that questions the safety of vaccines. Obediently, Vimeo, MailChimp, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Google all banned “anti-vax” content in unison, proving their criminal collusion and Chernobyl-scale crimes against humanity. Google is even developing plants to block all “anti-vax” websites at the browser level.

In my video, below, I reveal what else Chernobyl and the vaccine industry have in common.

Nurses in Australia are regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA), an agency under the government’s Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. NMBA members are appointed for three years by the Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council.

In October 2016, NMBA released new vaccination standards cracking down on nurses and midwives who “promote” anti-vaccination to patients and the public via social media. The new standards are justified on the grounds that promoting false, misleading or deceptive information is an offense under national law — the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 — and is prosecutable by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.

On October 20, 2016, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) released a statement threatening to take action against any nurse or midwife who promotes anti-vaccination via social media. The statement, “NMBA position clear, we will take action on anti-vaccination promoters,” reads:

The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) and AHPRA take their responsibility of public protection very seriously, and will take regulatory action on nurses or midwives who promote anti-vaccination statements to patients and the public. The recently published NMBA position statement follows the Board’s awareness that a small number of registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives have promoted anti-vaccination statements to patients and the public via social media which contradict the best available scientific evidence. Current evidence indicates that preventative measures such as vaccination are a clinically effective public health procedure for certain viral and microbial diseases…. The NMBA’s Social media policy also provide clear guidance to nurses and midwives when using social media and is unambiguous in stating that when using social media, in any context, the National Law, the NMBA’s code of ethics and code of conduct, and the Guidelines for advertising regulated health services apply…. If the NMBA decide to take action on a nurse or midwife’s registration they can issue a caution, accept an undertaking or impose conditions which limit their practice in some way. If a nurse or midwife’s registration is restricted, this will be published on the public online register of practitioners. The NMBA refer allegations of the most serious examples of professional misconduct to tribunals. Once a matter is referred to a tribunal it usually becomes public, and decisions are published online.

The NMBA statement also urges members of the public to report nurses or midwives who “promote” anti-vaccination.

According to The Guardian, Dr. Hannah Dahlen, a professor of midwifery at the University of Western Sydney and the spokeswoman for the Australian College of Midwives, said vaccination was essential to public health and safety, and that it is “concerning” that some midwives and nurses “are taking to social media in order to express a position not backed by science.” However, Dahlen added she was worried the crackdown may push people with anti-vaccination views further underground: “The worry is the confirmation bias that can occur, because people might say: ‘There you go, this is proof that you can’t even have an alternative opinion.’ It might in fact just give people more fuel for their belief systems.”

The World Health Organisation claims that vaccinations prevent up to three million deaths every year from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and measles.

The movement’s leader, Dane Wigington, says he’s putting his life on the line to reveal a truth that will shake society to its core. From the outside, it’s clear the hundreds showing up beat to a different drum. But stepping inside a packed Redding auditorium is like walking into another world. Outlandish ideas like weather warfare and climate engineering—in other words, weather control—are accepted as basic fact.

“Climate engineering is the single greatest assault on the environment ever launched by humanity, without question,” he said. Wigington, the lead researcher for GeoEngineering Watch, is sounding the alarm. “It’s a responsibility—it’s not an option, it’s an obligation,” he said.

HAARP controlled chemtrails are to blame, says Wigington

He claims grainy, shaky video is part of a mountain of evidence showing shadowy government forces are using planes to secretly spray fine particles of heavy metals like aluminum into the sky. The purpose, they believe, is to block some of the sun’s direct rays from reaching the earth in a desperate attempt to slow global warming.

“The list of corroborating material we have is immense, including lab tests that prove the same elements named in geoengineering patents—aluminum, barium, and other heavy metals are raining down on us in massive quantities,” he said.

If you’re skeptical, this won’t help—he claims the spraying is happening off the coast of California comes with an incredibly serious side effect. The heavy metal particles are blocking rainfall, effectively steering California’s somewhere else.

US Air Force Admits to Using HAARP For Weather Modification in Defense Hearing:

In other words, climate engineering, they say, is to blame for the harshest recorded drought in California’s history.

“Nobody has a right to do this. Nobody has a right to play God with the weather,” he said.

WIGINGTON: Yes, we are.

REPORTER: You know that sounds crazy. To an outsider, this sounds impossible; it sounds like science fiction.

WIGINGTON: You can’t interfere with the climate system, putting aerosols, fine particles into the atmosphere without affecting the rain, can’t do it.

REPORTER: What you’re saying is, that this drought is being directly caused?

WIGINGTON: There’s no question. The connection is inarguable.

Kyaw Tha Paw U is a UC Davis professor of atmospheric science and biometeorology with degrees from MIT and Yale.

“I would find it more likely—I’m not saying it’s actually happening—but it’s more likely there are extraterrestrial visits to the Earth (laughs) than this kind of thing happening,” he said. “I don’t know anyone in my field who believes that.”

Understanding how HAARP works and how it began:

The idea of climate engineering is out there, but actually doing it is another matter, he says. Civilian planes and most military aircraft can’t fly high enough to even make it feasible. He says the contrails people see behind planes are essentially ice clouds forming and is perfectly normal.

“It’s just a natural occurrence of combustion; water’s one of the byproducts of combustion,” he said.

The video from Wigington appears to show a spray between the contrails. The professor says it looks like a rare issue involving pressure variations that causes a trial to form behind the wing and not just the engines’ exhausts.

But Wigington is used to skeptics. He once was one.

“Talk is cheap for those who haven’t investigated. I didn’t want to believe this either,” he said.

His background is in solar power, but he started investigating on his own about a decade ago after becoming suspicious. that something was partially blocking the sun’s energy from reaching his solar home. He decided to go public.

“I can’t not do this. It’s the last thing I ever wanted to do. I’m not a political person, I’m not an activist, I’m simply a father that wants his children to have a future,” he said.

His group is gaining more attention. More than 1,000 people showed up in Redding from across the country. The panel included a former California Fish and Game biologist, a former U.S. Forest Service biologist and a U.S. Navy veteran.

“I’ve spoken to NOAA scientists face-to-face who’ve told me off the record they know this is going on, but they’re afraid to speak out because they have no First Amendment protection. I’ve been it the field with USDA soil scientists, same. I’ve been told by congressional representatives, same,” he said.

The underground movement has more than its share of critics, including scientists who dismiss the weather control claims as pseudoscience and conspiracy theory talk without reliable evidence.

“The negative things we like to find reasons for, and conspiracy theories are one of the ways to try and find a reason for it, when we don’t fully understand what’s going on,” Kyaw Tha Paw U said. Wigington is 100 percent certain climate engineering is happening and is causing California’s drought.

The truth, he says, will cause a global shockwave.

“The data backs this up; I’ve already bet my life on this fact and again, those who doubt this is going on, those who want to deny, those protecting their paychecks and pensions by denying it will not be able to much longer. The damage is too cataclysmic. There will be no hiding this issue much longer,” he said. source"

Harvard scientists, funded by Bill Gates, are attempting to copy the effects of a massive volcanic eruption to block the sun’s rays and reflect them back into space.

As part of a $3 million experiment, the team from Harvard University will “spray tiny chalk particles into the atmosphere 12 miles above the Earth,“

They hope these chemtrails will have a similar effect to an erupting volcano releasing sulphur dioxide.

MailOnline reports: In 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines, releasing 20 million tons of sulphur dioxide. That cooled the planet by 32.9 degrees Fahrenheit for 18 months.

The team hopes to launch a steerable balloon over the southwest United States before next July. It will release jets of calcium carbonate, or chalk dust. Scientists will measure how this affects the Sun’s light.

Opponents say spraying particles in such a way might damage the ozone layer and disrupt rainfall patterns, which could cause drought in some areas, according to The Times.

And they say such geo-engineering diverts attention from cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Although controversial, some think that trying to mimic the impacts of a volcano eruption is a viable way to control global warming.

This proposed type of climate geoengineering is called stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI).

Theoretically if done at scale — and sustained — the impact can be large. The 1-degree temperature drop which accompanied Mount Pinatubo’s eruption is equal to about half of the human-caused warming Earth has experienced since the Industrial Revolution began.

CBS reports: Dr. Gernot Wagner from Harvard University is an author of the paper. He said their study shows this type of geoengineering “… would be technically possible strictly from an engineering perspective. It would also be remarkably inexpensive, at an average of around $2 to 2.5 billion per year over the first 15 years.”

But to reach that point, the study said an entirely new aircraft needs to be developed. Partly because missions would need to be conducted at nearly double the cruising altitude of commercial airplanes. The study’s co-author, Wake Smith explained, “No existing aircraft has the combination of altitude and payload capabilities required.”

So, the team investigated what it would cost to develop an aircraft they dub the SAI Lofter (SAIL). They say its fuselage would have a stubby design and the wing area — as well as the thrust — would need to be twice as large. In total, the team estimates the development cost for the airframe to be $2 billion and $350 million to modify existing engines.

In their hypothetical plan, the fleet would start with eight planes in the first year and rise to just under 100 within 15 years. In year one, there would be 4,000 missions, increasing to just over 60,000 per year by year 15. As you can see, this would need to be a sustained and escalating effort.

As one may imagine, a concept like this comes with a lot of controversy.

The vaccine mafia is currently in the process of devising new ways to forcibly deliver the deadly human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil to low-income girls living in underdeveloped countries. Since the vaccine typically costs upwards of $400 for the full series of shots, it is simply unaffordable for the millions of young girls living in countries where an entire month’s wages for the average family barely cover this amount. So groups like the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI), a brainchild of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, are now having to come up with creative subsidization programs to achieve their ultimate goal of vaccinating every child on the planet.

Two recent studies, both of which were published in the open-access journal BMC Medicine, were designed to address this issue by explicitly examining the costs associated with delivering HPV vaccines to girls living in some of the poorest countries in the world. The impetus behind both studies, of course, was to figure out how an expensive vaccine with an extensive array of deadly side effects can be inexpensively introduced and distributed to girls whose families cannot afford it. And both studies found that bringing Gardasil to such girls will take an incredible amount of independent financial backing to ever come to fruition.

The first study, which involved an international cohort of experts from across Europe and Africa, compared the costs of implementing a class-based vaccine delivery system versus an age-based delivery system, while the second study evaluated the expected costs of implementing a World Health Organization (WHO) cost planning program for low-income countries. But based on conclusive data gathered from both studies, it was discovered that the costs associated just with delivering Gardasil to young girls exceeds the total amount already being spent on existing routine vaccination programs in their entirety.

Is eugenics the driving force behind the massive Gardasil push?

Because of this huge disparity, GAVI and other vaccine shill groups are quietly injecting significant amounts of subsidization capital to make sure as many girls as possible get vaccinated. And why are they doing this? They claim their efforts are driven by humanitarianism, as cervical cancer plagues many countries throughout Africa. But as we have pointed out on many previous occasions, Gardasil does not even prevent cervical cancer (http://www.naturalnews.com), at least not according to the science. The vaccine is also extremely deadly, carrying with it all sorts of serious side effects. (http://sanevax.org/)

It was also recently reported in the open-access journal Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs that both Gardasil (Merck & Co.) and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline), the two HPV vaccines on the market today, leave genetic fingerprints in the brains of children that receive them. According to the data, components of the vaccine cross the blood-brain barrier and cause blood vessel inflammation in the brain, which can lead to autoimmune disorders like cerebral vasculitis as well as death.

Let’s not call it a real deal. Why? Because this is only a so-called “framework,” and lots has to be agreed upon before it’s a real deal. There are two big problems: they are inspections of known and unknown sites, and Iran doesn’t have to dismantle any of its nuclear facilities. According to the Obama Administration, there is a so-called “fact sheet” laying out some of the main points describing what the Iranians will give up. Javad Zarif, the Iranian Foreign Minister negotiating the deal, refuted what Obama announced and called what he said “spin.” Zarif tweeted out: “The solutions are good for all, as they stand. . . . There is no need to spin using ‘fact sheets’ so early on.” The President also said the sanctions would be lifted “gradually” as the Iranians complied with the agreement. The Iranian Foreign Minister disputed that by giving another tweet that said, “US will cease the application of ALL nuclear-related secondary economic and financial sanctions.’ Is this gradual?” The Foreign Minister also said that the deal would not “scale back Iran’s program,” which is what Iran has been saying all along. The Iranians have been extremely consistent. The Iranians have basically accused the White House of lying about the deal. So, deal or no deal is the question. This is all supposed to be finalized by June 30th, and I can’t see how that is going to happen.

Reaction to this so-called deal from Israel and newly elected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is very negative. Netanyahu said, “A deal based on this framework would threaten the survival of Israel.” He also said, “It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war.” Also, a top Iranian General, just this week, said, “Israel’s destruction is non-negotiable.” Please keep in mind, he said this while negotiations were going on to curtail Iran’s nuclear program. My question is why did he think he could say this in the middle of sensitive negotiations? This kind of talk clearly shows a wider war in the Middle East is on the way.

It’s not just the Israelis who are nervous, the Arab or Sunni Muslims don’t like it either. They say it reflects “U.S. weakness,” and lifting the sanctions will allow Iran more money to spread its influence, just like they are doing in Yemen. It looks like this deal will not calm things down but lead to more violence between Sunnis and Shia Muslims. Is this a wider replay of what happened between Iraq and Iran in the 1980’s? Making this deal is like cutting a deal to get an arsonist to stop setting fires in the middle of a burning building. There are many other issues to be addressed and have not been.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin is threatening nuclear war on NATO over the Baltic States. He wants NATO to back away from its borders, and this is yet another area where war can break out. Putin is saying this because of recent increased arms shipments to Ukraine and to other Eastern European countries. Putin has also said that nuclear war was an option if there was an attempt to return Crimea to Ukraine. There hasn’t been much reporting on this story, but it’s there, and that, too, is another very hot spot in the world.

The economy grew at 0% in the first quarter. That is the official number from the Atlanta Fed that came out as a downgrade from the supposed estimated 2.3% growth in the first quarter. Imagine what the number would be if it factored in true inflation? That is in line with the latest figures for GDP from Goldman Sachs. It says this is the fourth month in a row the global economy has contracted. As John Williams and many other guests have been predicting, the economy would turn down this year and force more QE or money printing. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts also predicted this and contends there is nothing that will turn the economy around.

The drought in California is bad and getting worse. Governor Jerry Brown has put in statewide water restrictions for the first time in the state’s history. My question is why did it take him so long to act? I have been highlighting this story since last year. The entire state is in some sort of drought. NASA says the state has a year’s worth of water left. Most think of Hollywood when they think of California, but it grows an enormous amount of food. It is the leading producer of many fruits, nuts and vegetables. It generates more than $37 billion every year growing food. If this continues, it could wipe out much of the tax base in California, not to mention cut the global food supply.

While humanity battles a growing number of ecological disasters, the push for lower greenhouse gas emissions has struggled to gain traction.

In the face of the unlikely reversal of long held traditions and habits, researchers have been pursuing alternative methods for cooling the global temperature. One of these methods is known as geoengineering, or the deliberate mass manipulation of the climate. The controversial science is being touted as a potential “backup plan” should humanity fail to lower carbon emissions by two degrees.

This backup plan will now receive $4 million in funding, according to David Fahey, director of the Chemical Sciences Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory. E&E News first reported that Fahey told his staff that the U.S. government is ready to study two types of geoengineering.

One of these methods is solar radiation management, a type of geoengineering that involves spraying aerosols into the atmosphere in the hopes of reflecting sunlight and cooling the planet. This type of geoengineering is extremely controversial and previous studies have linked the technology to potentially dangerous outcomes for various parts of the planet.

The second tactic involves using aerosols to create artificial, low-lying clouds over the ocean. “This technique is borrowed from “ship tracks”—or long clouds left by the passage of ocean freighters that are seen by satellites as reflective pathways. They could be widened by injections of vapor from seawater by specialized ships to create shading effects,” E&E reports. Fahey says an upcoming study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine titled “Climate Intervention Strategies that Reflect Sunlight to Cool Earth“ will recommend further studies in both areas. He also suggests changing the term geoengineering to a “more neutral word” like “climate intervention.” Fahey called geoengineering a “tangled ball of issues” and said he hopes to give lawmakers a “clear view of how a hurry-up bid to save the planet would work.”

Still, Fahey admits that putting aerosols into the atmosphere “opens up this whole menu of things that you’d have to worry about.” Science Magazine notes that several smaller nations have already expressed concern that the use of aircraft to inject aerosols into the atmosphere might alter the weather or damage the ozone layer. Fahey says a scientific approach must involve identifying a list of unknowns, including unintended consequences.

The concerns surrounding geoengineering are widely known to anyone following the research. Claims that geoengineering could be employed without significantly altering the planet or without making things worse were rebuffed by a number of experts.

Alan Robock, a climate and aerosols expert at Rutgers University who previously conducted research for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has said that researchers claiming that there will be no significant effect do not take into account the reality that geoengineering may have additional side effects, like warming certain parts of the atmosphere, changing atmospheric circulation, or affecting the ozone layer.

Interestingly, Robock has previously stated that he believes the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) may already be using geoengineering techniques as a weapon of war. In 2015, while speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Jose, California, Robock stated he was phoned by two men claiming to be from the CIA, asking whether or not it was possible for hostile governments to use geoengineering, or mass manipulation of the weather, against the United States.

The public and scientific community should examine all of the available evidence which currently shows geoengineering might lead to potential loss of blue skies, lower crop yields, and increases in land and water temperature. According to a recent study published in Nature, geoengineering could lead to lower crop yields. This study is not the first to draw attention to the dangers of beginning geoengineering programs. According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, if geoengineering programs were started and then suddenly halted, the planet could see an immediate rise in temperatures, particularly over land.

Another study published in February 2015 by an international committee of scientists stated that geoengineering techniques are not a viable alternative to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat the effects of climate change. The committee report called for further research and understanding of various geoengineering techniques, including carbon dioxide removal schemes and solar-radiation management (SRM), before implementation. The scientists found that SRM techniques are likely to present “serious known and possible unknown environmental, social, and political risks, including the possibility of being deployed unilaterally.”

In October 2018, the United Nations IPCC issued a report that essentially called for climate engineering as the “last ditch” option to save humanity from environmental disaster. The calls for geoengineering programs are one step closer to reality now that the NOAA is scheduled to receive $4 million in funding. The closer geoengineering moves to reality the more calls for a global governance framework to guide the programs. It’s becoming apparent that calls for geoengineering will serve as a gateway to global government."

The New York Times has published dangerous misinformation about how to prepare for the coronavirus. The recent article said, “wash your hands, keep a supply of medicine, and GET A FLU SHOT.” This might be one of the most illogical pieces of medical advice ever doled out by the mainstream media. The article assures readers that getting a flu shot is a “practical tip” offered by “experts.” Meanwhile, the rest of the world rolls their eyes.

Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the source of the fake news

The article cites Dr. Keith Klugman, director of the pneumonia program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He says that infectious disease specialists strongly recommend flu vaccination for coronavirus and pneumonia. The best protection for older people against bacterial pneumonia, he says, is to “vaccinate children.”

According to David Brownstein, M.D., this is FAKE NEWS propaganda. “The flu vaccine has never been shown to protect against pneumonia,” he iterated. And obviously, the flu viruses used in the flu vaccine do not resemble coronaviruses and will not prepare the immune system in any way.

According to the CDC’s annual flu vaccine statistics, the flu vaccine is not effective at all for controlling the circulating flu strain each year. In fact, the flu shot has been found to cause mutations in flu viruses from the previous flu season, making people more susceptible to infection the following year. So, to think that inoculation with flu viruses is going to prepare the immune system for coronaviruses is illogical, to say the least. Even a coronavirus vaccine will be a risky, as evidenced by previous attempts to develop a vaccine for SARS.

Furthermore, researchers from the American Thoracic Society have found damning evidence surrounding the flu vaccine that many people won’t want to hear. Instead of preventing influenza-related hospitalization in children, the trivalent inactivated flu vaccine actually increases hospitalizations three fold!

Children who are subjected to the flu vaccine year after year are at an increased risk for hospitalization when compared to children who are not subjected to the vaccine. Children with asthma suffer the worst. This research shows there’s no efficacy to the vaccine; in fact, the flu vaccine poses net harm to children. The research is to be presented May 19, at the 105th International Conference of the American Thoracic Society in San Diego.

“This study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the TIV in children overall, as well as the children with asthma, to prevent influenza-related hospitalization,” said Joshi, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

The study examined 263 children who were thoroughly examined at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, aged six months to 18 years. Each of the children had experienced laboratory-verified influenza infection at some point between 1996 and 2006. The Mayo Clinic evaluated each child, whether they were subjected to the flu vaccine, whether they had asthma and finally, whether they needed hospitalization for influenza-related illnesses.

The results are not what vaccine manufacturers want to hear: Children who don’t get the flu vaccine recover from flu and other infections more effectively, rarely requiring hospitalization. Children who are subjected to the annual flu vaccine are three times more likely to suffer complication to infection, more likely to be hospitalized, and put on breathing treatments and other drugs. The risk of hospitalization post vaccination is even higher for children who already have inflamed airways and constricted breathing due to asthma.

This is partly due to the fact that flu vaccines contain thimerosal, a mercury compound that depletes intracellular glutathione production and causes oxidation of the mitochondria pathway of cells. Glutathione is the master antioxidant for the cells in the body. When it is depleted, a person’s immune system is weakened and they become more susceptible to complications from infections.

CDC fails to publish peer-reviewed science on how to strengthen the innate immune system

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program all recommend the flu vaccine for all children six months to 18 years. To decrease influenza-related hospitalization in children, it’s time for these organizations to rescind their flu vaccine recommendations. It’s also time for public health authorities to provide information and effective resources that can help children overcome infections naturally. On the CDC’s page for preparing for coronavirus, there is no mention of practical solutions for preparing the immune system.

Tools that actually help a child’s immune system overcome infection include, but are not limited to: elderberry syrup, whole food zinc and vitamin C supplements, proper hydration, no sugar or foods that generate mucus, a healthy fever response (not suppressed), sweet licorice root extracts, vitamin D supplements, colloidal silver, raw manuka honey, garlic-leek-onion-rich soups, and real fruit juices.

Not everyone’s immune system is the same and some children suffer from asthmatic conditions caused by environmental factors. Because asthmatic conditions are made worse, according to this study, by the annual flu vaccine, it’s important to learn how to reduce inflammation in the airways. Extracts of mullein herb, elecampane, turmeric root, marshmallow root, black cumin seed, and schisandra berry, are effective anti-inflammatory solutions for the respiratory tract and beyond.

In order to avoid complications and hospitalizations from infections, families should avoid artificial perturbation of the immune system via flu vaccines and instead accentuate the body’s innate immune defenses.

153,True,"The article suggests that there is a deliberate spraying of chemtrails containing toxic substances, such as barium and mercury, which are causing harm to machines and human health.

This is pointed out in some of the patents that describe the disbursement of nano-particles through jet engines. These patents demonstrate that jet engines are not harmed when fine metallic dust or nano-particles pass through them. That being said, these chemical aerosol nano-particles do harm small machines and some forced air electronics. For example, I have seen a dramatic increase in the failure rates of computer fans whose bearing oil dries up more quickly in the presence of reactive nano-particles. Also, I have also seen a dramatic increase in the failure rate of computer power supplies. These devices use forced-air to stay cool and consequently accumulate a large amount of semi-conductive dust which essentially shorts-out the electronics and damages sensitive control-related components. Consider how manufacturers benefit when oily chemtrail residue kills the fan on a computer video card. This causes the main chipset on the card to fail within a matter of hours or days causing you to have to purchase a new video card. Since only a small percentage of people will bother to return a video card for warranty service (if the fan happens to fail while the warranty is still valid), the net effect is dramatically increased sales and profits for manufacturers.

 

 Since I build and maintain all the computers that I use in our business, I have swapped out counless video cards in the past 7 years when the main cooling fan failed. I've also had to purchase at least 5 new power supplies to replace ones that overheated when a cooling fan failed. In short, I have seen the failure rate of computer cooling fans skyrocket in the past 7 years - the same period of time we have experienced heavy chemtrail spraying. I have also witnessed a change in the nature of the dust. Instead of the typical dry, light-gray dust we had witnessed since the mid 90's when we began building and repairing our own computers, we are now seeing dark—almost black—oily dust. Incidentally, based on the evidence we have seen, we believe that mercury may be one of the components of chemtrails, and that this mercury is combined with an oily petroleum product that acts as a delivery system because it can both carry the metal through the air and it can help it adhere to humans, animals, and crops. We had a small sample of dust tested and discovered that it contained .309 µg of mercury. You can view this dust test here. Dead computer power supplies, replacement computer fans, and oily dark-dust accumulations that began appearing only after chemtrails appeared in our area. Click to zoom each picture, then click ""More"" to view detailed descriptions at the bottom of each picture. The largest failure rate we've seen is in human bodies. The bodies we live in are highly complex machines which are highly-dependent on a fine balance of metals in our diet. These metals are even more important than vitamins to sustain body functions. Breathing toxic chemtrail nano-particles causes dramatic changes in the balance of our body-metals which lead to disease and death. My heart attack in 2011 was most-likely caused by the only related problem they found with my body; extremely low potassium. Low potassium is caused by barium exposure. In fact, barium is used to induce heart attacks in lab animals. Barium dramatically lowers body potassium which leads to heart attacks and death. Virtually all chemtrail-related research concludes that chemtrails contain enormous amounts of toxic barium. In the first 3 years of chemtrail spraying in our area, more people that I know died than in the entire rest of my life combined and doubled. Some of the most popular health issues leading to death were—and continue to be—heart attacks, strokes, aneurysms, and cancer, all of which are associated with the metallic nano-particle metals being sprayed on us daily. In fact, barium causes heart attacks and mercury causes high cholesterol, inhibited vitamin C utilization leading to strokes and aneurysms, and cancer. Mercury also causes over 200 of the most common diseases today. Make no mistake, if chemtrails contain barium and/or aluminum and/or mercury, they are deadly. In the end, the only benefactors of semiconductive chemtrail dust are the medical and pharmaceutical industries along with electronic parts manufacturers and computer manufacturers who end up selling more computers and replacement computer parts."

In the book, Annotated CATECHISM, by Anthony Schraner, on page 287, I quote the following words: “If we ignore the Catholic teaching of faith and morality, in whole or in part, or never listen to a sermon, never read a Catholic book or the Catholic press, conscience becomes a deceitful voice, a faithless guide.” -Anthony Schraner The above statement is heresy, a lie of the Devil. First of all, teachings of “faith and morality” come from the Word of God (the Bible), not from any religion or church. There can be no faith or morality apart from a holy and divine God. The Catholic Church arrogantly promotes their organization as if they were the ones who require faith and a life of holiness. The point is that our faith and morality MUST be directed towards God and NOT any church or religion. If we “ignore” the Catholic Churches’ teachings, that is OK! But we had better NOT ignore God’s commandments. God’s commandments are ONLY found in the Word of God, NOT in the traditions and manmade doctrines of the Catholic religion. Secondly, I want you to clearly notice that in the above statement by Anthony Schraner that the Word of God is NOT mentioned anywhere. Mr. Schraner tells us that our own “conscience becomes a deceitful voice” without the indoctrination of Catholicism. Isn’t the Word of God sufficient enough Mr. Schraner to guide us?

""All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be , unto all good works."" —2nd Timothy 3:16,17 In contrast to the Catholic Church (who continually steer people away from the Bible and towards their own teachings), God's Word never advises us to listen to religion. Religion is a lie. The Bible is a lamp unto our feet (""Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path,"" Psalm 119:105). John declares that God’s Word is Truth. Why do we need “Catholic” books or “Catholic” press to guide us? Is not the Word of God everything we need? Indeed, the Bible is sufficient to meet all of our spiritual needs. Jesus commands each believer in John 5:39... SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES!!!

The idea that a person cannot be spiritual without hearing a sermon is nowhere found in the Bible. Now a person may hear a Biblical sermon and benefit from it, but it’s the Word of God and the Holy Spirit that cause men’s hearts to change. The fact that Mr. Schraner doesn’t even mention the Bible speaks volumes. This is a typical Catholic indoctrination technique. Catholic writers will continually make references to “Catholic” this or “Catholic” that, while deliberately avoiding any mention of the Word of God or the Holy Spirit as a Guide. The Catholic Church doesn’t want anyone obeying the Bible or God; they want you to obey the Catholic Church (which is idolatry).

Listen to more indoctrinating words of Anthony Schraner on page 287: “…there is an infallible truth which God teaches us through the Church and to which we must constantly conform our life.” Through the Church? I triple-dog dare you to show me that doctrine in the Bible. Show me where the Bible teaches that God would teach us “through the Church.” The Bible DOES say that God would manifest His Word through preaching (Titus 1:3), but preaching and church authority are two very different things. The Catholic Church is a hierarchy of authority (NOT God's authority), with the Pope at the top. The Catholic Church arrogantly proclaims that they are “infallible,” just as the Word of God is infallible. In reality, the Catholic Church is NOT infallible. No church or human organization is infallible. ONLY the Word of God is infallible. God has PRESERVED His Word in the English speaking language through the 1611 King James Bible.

Need your mood tweaked a bit? Just step outside under the gaze of a chemtrail and inhale deeply. In addition to the barium, strontium, the nano bio apps and other assorted toxins, you’ll be ingesting a chemically tweaked Lithium, long known as a drug used for bi-polar disorder, depression and eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Gee, you won’t have to endure any more twenty minute sessions with your psychiatrist, am I right? Just walk outside under the haze and take a breath. Waking times has the story:

“There’s the official explanation for why NASA is spraying lithium, a pharmaceutical drug most often used to treat people with manic depression or bi-polar disorder, into our ionosphere, and then there is the probable reason(s). It would be easier to accept NASA’s official explanation if they were not so secretive about everything they study and do in space – but one thing is for certain – NASA’s own personnel have admitted that lithium, along with other chemicals, are intentionally being placed into our environment regularly. It is possible that many of NASA’s own employees aren’t even aware of the true motivations for carrying out such a project, ironically displaying the very behaviors that these chemicals/pharmaceuticals are meant to instill.

“In the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ([email protected]) admits that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere, and says that it is ‘harmless to the environment.’”

It’s important to distinguish a difference between the type of chemically endowed Lithium force fed by sociopaths and the natural lithium found in most rocks on the earth.

“… Lithium is a naturally occurring mineral from the earth. Just like calcium and potassium, lithium is something that every human body requires.

“Many people are familiar with the pharmaceutical forms of lithium (lithium carbonate and lithium citrate), these aforementioned chemical extracts used to treat mania and depression.

“Lithium orotate is different. Whereas pharmaceutical drug forms of lithium require high doses to penetrate cells, lithium orotate is effective in extremely small serving sizes. Unlike its pharmaceutical counterparts, lithium orotate is non-toxic and seems to be effective for 70% to 80% of people who try it… Lithium [oratate] has been shown to protect the system from numerous toxins, particularly in the grey matter of the brain.”

Unfortunately, as with most decisions from the brotherhood of darkness, the kind of lithium being strewn about in the heavens is the medicating kind.

“Here, to corroborate information being given by the NASA employee in the video, is the Code 8440 RMMO which states the exact purpose of using Wallops Flight Facility to launch a rocket containing lithium thermite:

… If you wanted to medicate the masses to create mindless, slave-like prisoners who didn’t even know they were imprisoned, this is surely a good way to do it. Spraying lithium into our skies, along with countless other bacteria, viruses, prions, parasites, fungi, carcinogens, toxins, hormone-altering drugs, anti-flora and anti-fauna, as well as gene-altering micro-dust is nothing more than bio-warfare against the world’s citizenry.”

Let’s not forget the assault on our food, either."

One reason that topics like dangerous vaccines do not get a lot of publicity is because the government is often willing to look the other way. Big Pharma’s reach is great, but it is about to find a very powerful opponent in the form of Tennessee congressman Dr. Mark Green.

Dr. Green is a physician who once ran a healthcare company, and he also has experience serving as an emergency army doctor in the military operation that saw the capture of Saddam Hussein. Needless to say, he has plenty of experience and knowledge on the topic of vaccines.

Speaking to constituents, he said that vaccines could be causing autism. Moreover, he said that he believes the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has “fraudulently managed” data related to vaccines.

He made the remarks at a town hall meeting in response to a question from a woman in the audience who had a young adult suffering from autism. These weren’t just empty comments intended to appease a constituent; he even said that he is prepared to defend his concerns over vaccine safety to the authorities.

He stated: “Let me say this about autism. I have committed to people in my community, up in Montgomery County, to stand on the CDC’s desk and get the real data on vaccines. Because there is some concern that the rise in autism is the result of the preservatives that are in our vaccines.”

“As a physician, I can make that argument and I can look at it academically and make the argument against the CDC, if they really want to engage me on it.”

He also said that taking a stand against the CDC’s possible withholding of vaccine research information would be a priority once he takes office.

Although he was quick to clarify that his own children are vaccinated, he believes that more research is needed – and quickly. He pointed out that autism rates have been climbing alongside vaccine numbers.

Indeed, autism cases are skyrocketing in the U.S., rising by 30,000 percent since the early ‘80s. Children who adhere to the CDC’s recommendations will get 70 doses of 16 vaccines, a figure that has nearly quadrupled since that time. These days, one out of every 36 children aged 3 to 17 are autistic.

While many doctors and the CDC insist that there is nothing to worry about, countless parents are telling a different tale. If vaccines are so safe, why is it that the government has already paid out nearly $4 billion in vaccine injury claims, including to autistic children who were damaged by vaccines? Why did they need to set up a vaccine injury claim court in the first place if there is nothing to worry about?

CDC coverup has already been exposed – is there more to the story?

Dr. Green also mentioned concerns raised by Florida Rep. Bill Posey and others that the CDC has been covering up a potential link between childhood vaccines and autism.

A senior epidemiologist from the CDC, Dr. William Thompson, along with the team of researchers working with him, uncovered a strong association between autism and vaccines in 2004, but their bosses instructed them to change the study’s parameters in a way that would make the association disappear. That way, the CDC would have nothing to report to the public.

Dr. Thompson came forward in 2014 with the previously buried data, which showed a statistically significant correlation between autism and the MMR vaccine in African-American boys in particular. His statement said that the co-authors then scheduled a meeting in which the documents related to that study would be destroyed.

He relayed how they met with a big garbage can and filled it with all the hard-copy documents they felt they should discard. However, he was concerned about the legality of it, so he took the precaution of keeping some hard copies in his office, along with computer files related to the case. Dr. Thompson was later given immunity from the Obama government.

That is just one of the cases that we know about, and it seems likely that there are plenty of other cover-ups that have not seen the light of day surrounding this very concerning issue. Vaccines are risky, and people deserve to know what can happen to them or their children if they get one so they can make an informed decision.

Dr. Green’s willingness to call the CDC out on its handling of vaccines and his interest in investigating the link between autism and vaccines further is very admirable.

This is the essence of all true religion. The Creator has infused human life with snowflake perfection. Man need only discern this design to discover indescribable beauty, peace and happiness. A loving bliss is at the heart of human life. Our worldly desires for money, sex (romance) and power are vain attempts to conjure it. But the more we pursue this counterfeit, the further we stray from the true source. The pursuit of worldly desires tends to enslave the soul. Bliss requires that we outgrow these desires. A relatively small clique is enslaving humanity. This is the London-based central banking cartel that controls the credit of most nations and is the mainspring of the Illuminati which controls Freemasonry. It has filched the government's credit card and can buy anything/anyone and charge the taxpayer. Few mortals could resist this temptation to own and control the world. The Illuminati want to be God and define reality according to their own dysfunction and arrested development. They want to expunge our belief in God (natural and moral order) and ensure mankind does not evolve as intended. Lucifer is their god; alienation, revolution, dysfunction and depravity are their worship. They want us to miss our Rendezvous with our Creator and languish in a drab prison cell with a television blasting money, sex (romance) and violence 24/7. Prisoners themselves, they would induct us into their private hell. Look at the mass media which they control. Do you see anything that warms your heart and reminds you of what it means to be human? Anything that expresses and fosters love for people? Anything that ennobles, (truly) educates, uplifts and empowers? Anything that encourages you to join with like minded people and work together? Ironically their gazillions of dollars cannot buy them what they really want. Like you and I, they want to be loved. Right now they hate people and people hate them. But if they were genuine benefactors, rather than ""philanthropists"" with a perverse secret agenda, they would be loved. We are their debt slaves. Our governments owe them trillions supposedly. In fact, they owe us trillions since we paid interest in real money for their imaginary loans. Let's make a deal. We'll forgive their debt if they relinquish control of the world's central banks. As Aaron Russo's film ""America: From Freedom to Fascism"" makes clear we must return the moneymaking function to democratically elected governments. This is the key to ending the cycle of war and depression that has afflicted humanity for centuries. This will remove the dead hand thwarting mankind's spiritual and cultural development. We are approaching a very critical period. More and more people recognize that 9-11 was a controlled demolition, a premeditated mass murder. Look at the video ""9-11 Myths: Demolition."" In the rubble, the steel central columns *stick out like proverbial sore thumbs. *They were /cleanly sliced/ at a 45-degree angle by thermite charges, like a buzz saw cuts a mighty oak. It's hard to believe the perpetrators thought they'd get away with this. Using state-sponsored terrorism, they are imposing a 1984 tyranny to protect themselves from prosecution. They are fomenting a gratuitous ""clash of civilizations"" a ""never ending war"" to further control and degrade us. I say to them. Find your bliss in the only place it exists, in the service of God and love of humanity. You cannot cheat the truth nor feel good without being good. Your path leads to hell and you will not escape the inferno. Right now, humanity is lost and demoralized. But the tide is already turning. The truth is the most powerful force in the universe.

The outspoken liberal is gaining more media attention

The unhinged congresswoman who is increasingly becoming 'the face of the left' has claimed she has been ""sent by God"" to stop President Donald Trump in another foul-mouthed rant.

The outspoken liberal has gained a lot of media attention recently after she incited violence against conservatives leading to one Flordia Trump supporter being punched in the face one of her supporters.

Charges were also filed against Waters after a video of her assaulting a journalist went viral on social media.

An assault complaint has been made by the victim, journalist Laura Loomer, who claims Waters physically assaulted her three times.

According to WJ: Now, she’s taken the vitriol to a whole new level. During a rambling anti-Trump speech at First AME Church in Los Angeles, an unhinged Waters declared that she had been personally sent by God Almighty to stop the president.

“You’ve gotta know that I’m here to do the work that I was sent (by God) to do,” she said from the pulpit of the church.

“(A)and as the pastor said to me when I came in this morning when God sends you to do something, you just do it!” she continued, making it clear that she saw her “anti-Trump mission” as coming from above.

“So I have a message I’m going back to Washington tomorrow morning, I’m going to tell them pastor told me to come here and just do it!” she concluded.

It was unclear if she also believed that God had instructed her to support abortion, which kills over half a million unborn children every year in the United States, or to allow countless unvetted murderers and rapists across the southern border with no enforcement.

That is the problem with her latest claim: It’s a perfect example of the sacrilegious “pick and choose” beliefs of the left.

It seems that God and Christianity are to be ignored when it’s convenient, but suddenly invoked when it helps bolster a radical desire to undermine the U.S. president.

Remember, it wasn’t that long ago that liberals were openly mocking conservatives like George W. Bush and Mitt Romney for being men of faith.

“The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God,” atheist writer Sam Harris wrote during the Bush presidency.

“If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency.

I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive,” the liberal continued, echoing the smug and dismissive tone frequently used by the media when the topic of God comes up.

Barack Obama’s infamous scorn against Americans who “cling to their religion” is a perfect example of this disdain for faith.

It hasn’t stopped. Christians like Mike Pence and Marco Rubio continue to be lambasted and ridiculed for believing in God, despite the fact that the vast majority of Americans hold similar beliefs.

Even Democrats who claim to be Catholic, including John Kerry and Dick Durbin, seem to conveniently put their religion in the closet when it gets in the way.

Both have been banned by the church from taking communion due to their support for late-term abortion, but seemed unbothered by this.

It’s the hypocrisy that is the problem.

Liberals can’t seem to decide if they loath believers or think that God sent them on a mission to attack the president; it apparently depends on the whims of the day.

One side is appalled by abortion; the other side celebrates it.

One side stands up for religious liberty; the other side sees Christians and Jews as the enemy.

One side wants an all-powerful government that meddles in every aspect of life; the other side believes in God-given rights and human liberty.

If Democrats like Waters truly think that God plays petty politics, they might want to take a look in the mirror … there just might be a plank in their eye."

The heavy spraying of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California in recent days has caused record warmth and record low humidity, they were preparing for yet another geoengineered ""winter storm"" further east.The latest in a parade of geoengineered winter storms has theatrically been named ""winter storm Achilles"". The ongoing extremely radical forcing of the Earths climate system is wreaking havoc on the environment as a whole. The example outlined below, with data from NOAA (national oceanic and atmospheric administration) and ""AccuWeather"" is only the latest in a very long and growing list of completely engineered weather events. The ""weather makers"" seem to have absolutely no regard for the climate chaos they are creating around the globe. How far can they push the envelope? If the ongoing insanity of global geoengineering continues, we will likely soon enough find out as the entire climate system unravels around us all. Amarillo TX shattered its former record high temperature on April 30th 2013, nearly reaching 100 degrees, now, snow is going to fall the very next day, May 1st, 2013. One has to wonder just how much toxic chemical ice nucleation material it takes to create such an extreme event. Very significant HAARP readings are also evident on monitoring stations in recent days, this is certainly a component of the latest engineered ""winter storm"". The now constant use of the globes ionosphere heater installations to manipulate jet stream patterns is also throwing the entire climate/weather system of the tracks. The ongoing atmospheric spraying programs, and the HAARP ionosphere heater installations, are not just an inconvenience, they are literally threatening the planet's life support systems from top to bottom. This is not even to mention the completely toxic fallout of heavy metals and chemicals which are raining down on all life. These elements are ""bioaccumulative"" and are building up in the environment and our bodies. Its up to all of us to bring these lethal weather modification programs to light. All is at stake in the fight to expose these deadly climate modifications operations. Every day matters in this effort.

Once you realize that the bribes which Amerikan-politicians are being bribed with comes directly from you: Because Israels money was stolen from us by Israel and is being used to pay their trained assassins from their Zionist Supremacy to kill us. Basically Israels using our own money to plan and carry out the executions of everyone that disagrees with Israel and your money is at the very heart of this particular treason. Once you know this for the fact that it ismaybe youll be able to finally understand who is really pulling all the strings and why that continues to happen? Who is behind Planned Parenthoods multi-billion dollar industry in illegal body parts that are being illegally taken from aborted babies to sell for mega-profits today? Thats an industry thats turning some Americans into Zombies, thanks to Israels control over Planned Parenthood ­ for starters. Whos behind the stumbling Race-Wars in America thats still trying to catch fire? Israel founded the NAACP and has been directing traffic for the looming race war from the beginning. Everything from Political Correctness in the nineteen-thirties to the present day policies in public education, medicine and GMO Crops were each fostered and directed by Israel to utterly destroy the United States and the world. Of course this includes those beneath the war on men, the perversion of women and the push to utterly destroy the physical basis for families of any type by twisting sex beyond all bounds while glorifying pedophiles. Israel has structured the perversion of the police away from protection of the public to the vilification of Veterans, women and people of color, along with Christians and patriots as Enemies of the Police State that Israel has created here, in what was the United States. The policies of ICE, Immigration & Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security and TSA are all servicing Israel in her efforts to totally eviscerate America. ICE serves as the distributor of some of the 50 million illegal immigrants from their arrival to their final destinations, courtesy of Homeland Security and the illegal government. DHS, along with the defunct Border Patrol are enabling the placement of the illegals across the nation. These circumstances have immeasurably helped to create no borders, no laws and no human-rights, which is exactly what Israel has sought since she joined the criminal UN to block United States citizens in every area of life on earth. And thanks to our SILENCE, theyre almost there Why are these things not challenged seriously or even discussed by any of these so-called politicians? The fact that theyre all traitors might have a bearing on that, given these still unfolding facts: These are just some of the most glaring crimes of the traitors and the treasons we have not chosen to deal with: They are not even close to the enormity of the crimes that we still wont discuss. How can you really think that youre still FREE?

 George W. Bush formerly began this hellish nightmare, yet no one dares to even mention who pulls his pathetic strings, then or even now, because they went far beyond Dick Cheney and all the so-called officials in charge at the time"

Speaker of the House John Boehner lays out a case that “Airstrikes Not Enough” to defeat ISIS. Boehner said, “At some point, somebody’s boots have to be on the ground.” ISIS has half of Bagdad surrounded, and I predict the U.S. will send ground troops sooner than later. The coalition is building with countries such as the UK, Belgium and France, but they will not bomb in Syria—only Iraq. I suspect they are afraid of making Russia angry. This is much more than just Iraq and Syria because I think this is a clash of cultures, and the ISIS message has gone global to the more than 1 billion Muslims. This article talks about ISIS getting recognition because of the airstrikes. It also talks about how ISIS wants payback for treatment of Muslims and how it is projecting the idea that it will be the winning team. ISIS is popping up in places such as Europe, the U.S., India and Australia. Countries such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia are all in for bombing Syria and Iraq. This is just shaping up to be the warm up act for a global war.

The financial war has been going on for a while and it is not abating. Notice those cheap oil prices? There is speculation that oil could hit $60 a barrel! Sure, part of that is declining demand, but part of it is Saudi Arabia who continues to pump oil instead of cutting back production. Why? Saudi Arabia wants to lower oil prices to hurt Russia, and it’s willing to cut prices and take a hit to do it. Also, is this Saudi Arabia helping out Obama and Democrats for the bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria? Who knows, but the Dems love the price drop in oil just before Mid-term elections. Don’t expect cheap oil to be a long trend.

Meanwhile, Russia is brushing off the pain sanctions are causing. Putin is not worried about 8% inflation and a record low ruble. Putin says it will just make relations with China and other BRIC countries all that much stronger. Meaning, there will be less use of the U.S. dollar in international trade. Please don’t forget the oil and natural gas card Putin is holding over Europe this winter. The colder it gets, the uglier the EU economy will get.

Speaking of the economy, it is not looking good, at least to IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. She is “quite worried” that the market is disconnecting to the real economy, and former Fed Head Ben Bernanke agrees. So does Mario Draghi of the ECB. He wants to print euros to buy bonds from insolvent banks. Germany wants to stop that because it is illegal in the Eurozone. If you are printing money to prop up an economy, how good can things be? They keep touting this bogus 4.6% GDP number for the second quarter here in the U.S., but housing, manufacturing and consumer confidence are all down. Gregory Mannarino of TradersChoice.net says the “world economy is on life support, and they can’t tell you the truth.” Of all the people I talk to on the economy, one consensus point pops out. We are headed for another financial crash, and the next one will be the granddaddy of them all. Big changes are coming, like it or not.

A Missouri doctor says the CDC is “lying” or is “grossly incompetent” about the Ebola threat. Dr. Gill Mobley, who is a micro biologist and trauma doctor, boarded a plane in Atlanta with a full hazmat suit on complete with goggles, gloves and mask. He had written on his hazmat suit “CDC is lying.” He did this as a protest of the handling of the Ebola threat. We were told that the chance of having Ebola here was extremely small. Now, it’s reported 100 people came into contact with an infected man who flew into Dallas Texas.

The Islamic terror is increasing, and the Democrats provide lip service. Now, the Democrats want to disarm America in the face of rising violence from radical Islam. The Obama Administration would like you to believe that these terrorists are “self-radicalized.” In many cases, that is not the true story. There is a percentage of mosques in the U.S., according to the FBI, that teach and encourage violence and jihad. According to several different whistleblowers and reports, the Obama Administration has been shutting down investigations into radical Islam and, in some cases, scrubbing suspected terrorists from data bases. President Obama has repeatedly said that ISIS is on “defense,” but his own CIA director, John Brennan, said in Congress, this week, ISIS is “formidable and resilient.” Brennan warns that ISIS is not only training more fighters to attack America, but ISIS will likely get into the country posing as refugees from Syria.

The economy is so weak that, once again, the Federal Reserve cried wolf on raising interest rates and did not do it. Gregory Mannarino of TradersChoice.net told me, “The Fed cannot raise rates—ever. Next step is for the Fed to buy corporate bonds to suppress interest rates even more.” Some other signs the economy is in deep trouble come from Walmart, America’s largest retailer. They are laying off 1,500 people at 500 stores. Bank of America, the largest retail bank in the U.S., is laying off 8,000. If the economy was growing, would the biggest retailer and the biggest bank be laying off people by the thousands?

Donald Trump answered President Obama’s criticism this week by saying, “Obama is madder at me than the Islamic terrorist that just killed 49 people in Orlando.” Trump is also continuing to fight bias in the mainstream media (MSM). The Trump campaign revoked the press credentials of The Washington Post after it ran a false headline that read “Donald Trump suggests that President Obama was involved in the Orlando shooting.” This is why Trump continues to call the MSM “liars.” It may also be the reason that trust in TV news and newspapers just hit an all-time low in a new Gallup poll.

One unlikely candidate, former Senator Bob Graham (D-Fla.), who co-chaired a research committee studying this matter, stated on August 1: “None of the people leading this investigation think it is credible that 19 people—most of whom could not speak English and did not have previous experience in the United States—could carry out such a complicated task without external assistance.”

Such strong words of condemnation emanating from a former senator should not be taken lightly, especially since Graham, at the moment this inside-outside job occurred, was having breakfast with General Mahmoud Ahmad, head of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, their version of the Central Intelligence Agency. By many accounts, Ahmad served as an intermediary money-man, wiring $100,000 to Mohamed Atta, one of the most well-known 9-11 patsies.

Representatives Walter Jones (R-N.C.) and Steve Lynch (D-Mass.) have recently hinted at the disclosure of the redacted 28 pages of the 871-page report produced by the government’s first investigation into 9-11, entitled “Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.” The Bush administration originally classified this section due to alleged national security threats.

Although not yet publicly released, this expose purportedly points a finger of blame at Saudi Arabian involvement in this plot against American citizens. Concerns over these details are so intense that both Jones and Lynch claimed to have signed confidentiality agreements before being allowed to read the transcripts.

Still, could the drama surrounding these revelations be little more than a red herring or bait-and-switch tactic? AMERICAN FREE PRESS readers are well aware of Israeli complicity in this conspiracy, yet more than a decade after 9-11 there’s absolutely no mention of Mossad collusion emanating from government officials or the mainstream media.

Taking a different approach to spread awareness, a New York City nonprofit group called the High-Rise Safety Initiative has submitted a petition with over 67,000 signatures to the City of New York’s city clerk in an effort to get a ballot initiative on the November mid-term elections. With more than double the names needed, these activists want to compel city legislators into opening a new inquiry that addresses how World Trade Center (WTC) Building 7 collapsed.

In a related story, on August 1, Richard Gage, the founder of Architects & Engineers for 9-11 Truth, appeared live for 40 minutes on C-SPAN to point out glaring inconsistencies concerning the controlled demolitions of WTC 1, 2 and 7.

On August 14, this reporter interviewed author, publisher and radio talk show host Jon Larsen Shudlick, who is knowledgeable about Gage’s speech.

“Gage’s presentation was a watershed moment in truth, particularly when he asked how a 47-story building could crumble in 6.5 seconds at free-fall speed when it hadn’t been struck by airliners and wasn’t on fire,” said Shudlick.

Shudlick continued: “C-SPAN scheduled Gage because so many viewers kept phoning in to their shows wanting to know what really happened on 9-11. People realize that these crimes reach into the highest echelons of the U.S. and Israeli governments. AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] also has everything to do with ensuring the cover-up because they control which political candidates receive contributions.”

Finally, amid rumors that Russian President Putin may release scores of 9-11-related documents, astute observers undoubtedly raised questions regarding Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17. Specifically, why were there tons of visible debris at the site of the crash in Ukraine as compared to a lack thereof for Flight 93 that we’re told crash-landed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and “vaporized” into the ground?"

But it’s not just the UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon that seems to be gaining more transparency.

Strange things have been observed in space. Perhaps this is why the Russian government recently called for an international investigation regarding the missing film footage of the U.S. moon landings, or why a U.S. Defence physicist and the Deputy Manager of the Clemintine Mission to the moon recently blew the whistle on what’s really up there.

Major General Albert Stubblebine can be added to the long list. Although he did not participate in the Citizens Hearing On UFO disclosure (where a number of military, political, academic, and government personnel testified to several former congressional members), his credentials speak for themselves.

General Stubblebine (above) is a retired United States Major General. He was also the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), and one of America’s most distinguished soldiers and chief of U.S. Army Intelligence, with 16,000 soldiers under his command.

He was a major proponent of “psychic” warfare and a key player in the “Stargate” project, which was a remote viewing program. Remote viewing can be defined in multiple ways. It’s the ability of individuals to describe a remote geographical location up to several hundred thousand kilometers away (sometimes even more) from their physical location.

The results of this project were declassified and published in the peer reviewed Journal of Scientific Exploration. (source) In this program, individuals successfully described physical objects that were nowhere near their physical location.

These programs were the inspiration behind the movie “Men Who Stare At Goats.”

Here’s what General Stubblebine had to say about Mars, perhaps thanks to some intel from the Remote Viewing Program?

“There are structures on the surface of Mars. I will tell you for the record that there are structures underneath the surface of Mars that cannot be seen by the Voyager cameras that went by in 1976. I will also tell you that there are machines on the surface of Mars and there are machines under the surface of Mars that you can look at, you can find out in detail, you can see what they are, where they are, who they are and a lot of detail about them.” — (Dolan, Richard. UFOs And The National Security State; New York: Richard Dolan Press)(source 2)

I’ll let you think about that for a moment. Is it really that farfetched? With all of the recent UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon disclosure happening within the past few years, is it really hard to fathom the existence of structures, bases, etc. on the Moon and on Mars?"

The World Health Organization has announced that Europe is now the “epicenter” of the global coronavirus pandemic.

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press conference that this is because more cases are being reported outside of China than in the coronavirus’ country of origin.

“Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China… More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its pandemic,” said Dr. Tedros.

Dr. Tedros continued to say that every country in the world now needs to enact a more “comprehensive approach” to combating the spread of the coronavirus.

“Not testing alone, not contact tracing alone, not quarantine alone, not social distancing alone — do it all,” he said.

As of press time, the Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center reports that there are now 145,369 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 5,429 deaths and 71,694 recoveries. While China still has the most reported cases by far, at 80,971, the rest of Europe is steadily catching up.

On Wednesday, the WHO declared that COVID-19 is now characterized as a pandemic. European countries are reporting more cases each day, and each country is reacting differently to the spread of the disease.

Italy, which is the hardest-hit country in the world other than China, has been put under a national lockdown. The country reportedly has 17,660 cases, including 1,266 deaths. Under the rules of their lockdown, travel will only be allowed for people who have an “urgent reason.” Most businesses in the country, except for groceries and pharmacies, were ordered to close until April 3, and professional sporting events have been suspended. According to the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, anybody who defies the lockdown and heads outside without a permit will either be fined or face criminal charges.

Spain, the second hardest-hit country in Europe, has 5,232 confirmed cases, including 133 deaths and 193 recoveries. The country has suspended its congress, from convening for at least a week after several ministers of parliament (MP) tested positive for COVID-19. All flights to and from Italy have been canceled until March 25. All schools and universities in the country have been closed, and all public events that involve more than 1,000 people have been banned.

Germany, the third hardest-hit country in Europe, has 3,675 confirmed cases, including eight deaths and 46 recoveries. The country has tightened border control checks, with health authorities being given the discretion to decide whether or not anybody exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms should be quarantined. Several states have closed down schools and canceled events that include more than 1,000 people, following recommendations from the federal government. (Related: German chancellor Merkel warns 70 percent of Germany now at risk of being infected by the coronavirus.)

France, which has 3,667 confirmed COVID-19 cases, is focusing its efforts on detecting coronavirus cases. Non-essential surgical operations have been delayed to prioritize the attention of medical workers to COVID-19 patients. French citizens returning from China, Iran, northern Italy, Singapore and South Korea will immediately be placed under quarantine upon their arrival. Gatherings that involve more than 1,000 people have been banned unless they are “essential to the life of the nation.”

Many more countries around Europe are experiencing the deadly effects of the pandemic: Denmark has shut down its schools and “indoor public cultural institutions” such as libraries. Sweden is ordering anybody who exhibits flu-like symptoms to self-quarantine, while Austria and Greece are ordering people who have recently traveled to affected countries to go into isolation.

“Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks that won’t happen to us is making a deadly mistake,” said Dr. Tedros, “it can happen to any country.”"

It also makes building Israeli settlements in the West Bank an international crime. This is all taking place less than thirty days before Trump’s inauguration. Is Obama creating as much chaos as possible before he leaves office? I say YES!!!

On another front, President Obama has expelled 35 Russian officials from the U.S. because of allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Russians say Obama is “paranoid” and denies the charge. Now, the Kremlin is vowing retaliation for expelling its diplomats and seizing Russian property in the U.S. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has negotiated a ceasefire in Syria without any involvement from the Obama Administration.

There are big flashing warning signs with the U.S. stock market and bond market. According to Gregory Mannarino of TradersChoice.net, the long end of the yield curve is flattening out, and that has always signaled trouble in the past. The same pattern happened just before the dot com crash and the 2008 financial meltdown. Mannarino says look for a horrible start to 2017 in the markets just as bad, or worse, than the beginning of 2016—which was the worst start ever for the Dow and S&P.

Celente says, “Last week, when it was a celebration of . . . 2009 and the markets started going up, Fisher says, quote, ‘We injected cocaine and heroin into the system to enable a wealth effect . . . and now we are maintaining it with Ritalin.’ Fisher also said, a few weeks ago, that ‘the Fed is a giant weapon that has no ammunition left.’ Let’s take his quote, and this is very important, ‘We injected cocaine and heroin into the system.’ You go back to our 2010 alert, and we said this was no recovery. It was a cover-up. What Fisher just said was a criminal act. Injecting cocaine and heroin into the system was a criminal act by the banking gang.”

Celente says the announcement of increased money printing by the European Central Bank last week only means one thing, “The bond buying bubble has burst. You can see what happened. All of a sudden, they announced this widely anticipated announcement–gold prices went way down and the markets went way up. Then, all of a sudden–the markets went down and gold prices went way up.

The banks loaned them the money, they have to pay it back now and . . . they are not going to be able to pay back their debt. Follow the banks, and follow the money.”

Celente goes on to point out, “They are devaluing the currencies around the world. Would you want to hold euros while they are devaluing them? That’s why people are going into gold. . . .It’s collapsing in front of us. Their deal isn’t working. . . . They are money junkies and they have overdosed.

President Donald Trump has blasted Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), accusing the Democrat leader of trying to create ""panic"" over the coronavirus to give herself a ""political advantage.""

Speaking during his coronavirus press conference Wednesday night, President Trump was responding to Speaker Pelosi’s criticisms of him.

Earlier on Wednesday, Pelosi accused the Trump administration of responding “too late” to halt the possible spread of China’s deadly coronavirus in the United States.

“This is shameful,” Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill when asked about the administration sending a $2.5 billion supplemental budget request to combat the illness.

“He puts forth a proposal now that is meager, anemic in terms of addressing this.

""Ebola, we did $5 billion. And now they’re trying to take the Ebola money and spend it here.”

During Trump's press conference, a reporter asked, “What is your response to Speaker Pelosi, who said earlier today you don’t know what you’re talking about about the coronavirus?

""I’m also wondering if you’d want to address critics who say you can’t be trusted about what your administration is saying?”

Trump said, “I think Speaker Pelosi is incompetent.

""She lost the Congress once. I think she’s going to lose it again.

""She lifted my poll numbers up 10 points. I never thought i would see that so quickly and so easily.

""I’m leading everybody. We’re doing great. I don’t want to do it that way.

""It’s almost unfair if you think about it.

""But I think she’s incompetent and I think she’s not thinking about the country.

""Instead of making a statement like that where I’ve been beating her routinely at everything, instead of making a statement like that, she should be saying we have to work together because we have a big problem potentially, and maybe it’s going to be a very little problem.

""I hope that it’s going to be a very little problem, but we have to work together.

""Instead, she wants to do the same thing with Crying Chuck Schumer.

""He goes out and says, 'the president only asks for two and a half billion dollars. He should have $8.5 billion.'

""This is the first time I’ve ever been told we should take more.

""Usually, it’s we have to take less. We should be working together.

""He shouldn’t be making statements like that because it’s so bad for the country.”

""Nancy Pelosi, she should go back to her district, cleaned it up,” Trump continued.

""I’m just saying, we should all be working together,"" he added.

""She’s trying to create a panic, and there’s no reason to panic because we have done so good.

""All they’re trying to do is get a political advantage.

""This isn’t about political advantage. We’re all trying to do the right thing.

""They shouldn’t be saying, ‘This is terrible. President Trump isn’t asking for enough money.’

""How stupid a thing to say?

""If they want to give us more money, well that’s OK, we’ll take more money … but they shouldn’t demean the people on the stage that are the finest in the world.

""They’re demeaning the greatest health care professionals in the world,"" he concluded.

During the press conference, President Trump announced that Vice President Mike Pence will lead the US response to the coronavirus."

The Left-wing establishment media took a big step this year in becoming ‘official state-run media,’ completely throwing in with the Democrat Party and going all-out to attack and trash President Donald Trump and his supporters.

But when the corporate-run media outlets weren’t defiling Trump’s reputation with lies fed to them by the deep state, they were doing their best to propagandize against truth on many levels and with various subjects.

Mostly, that involved censoring facts through acts of omission.

With that, and after careful review, we bring you 10 of the most egregious and outrageous examples of censorship and lying of the past year.

1. Google to begin blocking all anti-cancer, ‘anti-vax,’ and anti-GMO websites

As exclusively reported by Natural News’ founder and editor Mike Adams in July, search behemoth Google will begin blocking all websites that publish truth about alternative cancer treatments, the dangers behind vaccines, and disturbing health facts related to GMO foods.

Because we can’t have free exchanges of ideas and information when such exchanges disrupt the status quo with facts the healthcare industry doesn’t want you to know.

2. Google declares supplements and organics to be a ‘lie’ and a ‘scam’

Google struck a blow against health facts and truth again over the summer when it began “censoring all content about organics, homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic, herbs, nutrition and supplements,” Adams reported, citing an analysis of data from Sanyer Ji, founder of GreenMedInfo.

3. Facebook also pledged to block ALL posts questioning the deadly vaccine industry

At the request of House Intelligence Committee chairman and lead Trump impeachment hoaxer Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Facebook announced in February it would soon begin censoring any content that questions the establishment healthcare industry’s dogma that ‘all vaccines are safe and effective.’

So much for that First Amendment thingy.

4. Amazon prefers satanism over any films that are critical of the vaccine industry

Yes, the e-tailer giant also got into the censorship act this past year when officials declared they banned the sale of anti-vaccine documentaries based on ‘sound science and replicable data,’ while still allowing people to publish and sell books on “Satanism” — in particular, satanist books that focus on teenagers.

That Jeff Bezos…what a guy. It’s almost as though he wants to oversee the destruction of truth and the free exchange of ideas while promoting tyranny and authoritarianism. And censorship.

And this guy owns the Washington Post.

After Adams, the Health Ranger, appeared on the Alex Jones Show to discuss the truth about Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s “criminal fronting for Bitcoin and deep state money laundering,” lo and behold he found his channel and those belonging to Natural News blocked, and without explanation.

Dorsey was pushing a Lightning Labs project that was, at the time, working to push a new protocol into Bitcoin, but he didn’t discuss it on the air with host Joe Rogan — who never asked the Twitter CEO about that massive conflict of interest.

6. Did the Trump administration send a warning to Big Tech?

In June, Adams reported that shortly after the Trump White House announced a Justice Department anti-trust probe into Google, “dozens of tech companies have been disrupted via sweeping internet outages that many are calling the ‘internet kill switch.’”

The reason for the investigation was the continued censorship by the Big Tech giants of conservative, pro-Trump websites and news organizations. Maybe the ‘kill switch’ was the administration’s way of saying, ‘Stop messing with us or we’ll put you out of business,’ Adams intimated.

Around the same time of the ‘kill switch’ incident, Facebook permanently banned Natural News from posting any content following “a coordinated, heavily-funded smear campaign against” the news site and its founder, Adams. “This is on top of permanent bans of Natural News content from Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, Google News, Apple, and other techno-fascists that now represent” a massive threat to human freedom.

Earlier, in February, Apple demanded that Natural News stop publishing factual news and information pertaining to the abortion industry and Satanism, or the Big Tech giant would block Natural News from all Apple devices.

“With Democrats now openly pushing infanticide and the legalization of the serial killing of infants, tech giants like Apple are serving as the censorship “speech police” to silence all criticism of the gruesome practice,” Adams wrote.

Police arrested Pastor David Lynn and charged him with “disturbing the peace” for simply preaching the word of the Lord on a street corner (where, presumably, Canada’s laws recognizing the freedom of speech and expression still apply). This was after he was approached and harassed by Leftists.

10. Microsoft gets in on the censorship too

In January, Microsoft unveiled plans to partner with NewsGuard, a startup that aims to censor much of what appears on the Internet that does not comport with Left-wing establishment and globalist agendas. Labeling ‘dissent’ as “fake news,” Microsoft’s effort is nothing more than blatant censorship."
170,True,"The article suggests that the FBI is hiding evidence and engaging in corrupt practices, which implies a conspiracy.",True,The article mentions the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as the actor responsible for hiding evidence and engaging in corrupt practices.,True,The article describes the FBI's actions of hiding evidence and engaging in corrupt practices.,False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,The article connects events and observations related to the FBI's actions and the 9/11 lawsuit.,True,The article suggests that the FBI is trying to conceal evidence and mislead the public.,"Notorious for failing in its duty to thwart terrorist attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is under fire again, this time from a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators who want the beleaguered law enforcement agency investigated for “major abnormalities” involving evidence in a terrorism case. Known for its corrupt method of operating, the FBI appears to be hiding evidence critical to a pending Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) lawsuit brought by family members of 9/11 victims. Two years ago, the FBI received a civil subpoena in the case and the lawmakers believe the agency has committed numerous violations and may be trying to conceal that its “investigative files are in a state of disorder.”

In a letter to the FBI watchdog, the Department of Justice Inspector General (DOJ IG), the senators write about “troubling reports concerning the FBI’s irregular treatment of a civil subpoena issued by the September 11 families.” The lawmakers, New York Democrat Charles Schumer, Iowa Republican Charles Grassley and Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal mention half a dozen concerns that merit a probe by the IG, including the FBI’s refusal to conduct methodological searches of its electronic databases, “instead empowering FBI officials with inherent conflicts of interest to hand-select the materials to be considered for possible production, and to control the information that is produced.” Judicial Watch has regularly encountered similar obstacles over the years in efforts to obtain public records from the FBI, most recently involving the shady anti-Trump “dossier” masterminded by corrupt FBI officials plotting against the president. Last month the FBI used coronavirus as an excuse to shut down its electronic public records operations.

In the 9/11 lawsuit families are seeking information about the FBI’s investigation of two Saudi Arabian government employees—Omar al Bayoumi and Fahad al Thumairy—who provided 9/11 hijackers Nawaf al Hazmiand and Khalid al Mihdhar and their accomplices “substantial assistance.” Thumairy was a Saudi consular official in Los Angeles and his ties to the hijackers are detailed in a once-classified portion of the 9/11 Commission Report that was declassified in 2016. In the spring of 2018 attorneys representing the 9/11 families served a civil subpoena on the FBI for the information critical to their case, but there may have been major abnormalities in the FBI’s handling of that subpoena that deserve the inspector general’s attention, the lawmakers write.

Here is what the veteran legislators allege that merits a probe; departures from established processes for responding to civil discovery demands, which would violate the FBI’s legal obligation and are designed to guard against conflicts of interest within the agency; misstatements to the federal court presiding over the litigation about the actual status of investigations; misstatements to the federal court regarding the sensitivity of the evidence being sought, including efforts to conceal original classification designations; efforts to conceal that the FBI’s investigative files are in a state of disorder; efforts to conceal the fact that key investigative materials collected after the attacks were never properly analyzed; refusal to conduct methodological searches of FBI’s electronic databases, instead empowering FBI officials with inherent conflicts of interest to hand-select the materials to be considered for possible production and to control the information that is produced.

“These allegations by the families raise questions as to whether FBI personnel may be acting in improper ways to withhold evidence the 9/11 families are entitled to receive, and that this obstruction may be driven by an effort to shield the Bureau and individual FBI officials from embarrassment,” the senators write. “Obviously, any irregularities, abuse, fraud, or improprieties in the handling of the 9/11 families’ subpoena for evidence are entirely unacceptable.” The lashing continues: “The September 11 attacks represent a singular and defining tragedy in the history of our Nation. Nearly twenty years later, the 9/11 families and American public still have not received the full and transparent accounting of the potential sources of support for those attacks to which they are entitled. Circumstances that leave the impression that our government is hiding facts about 9/11 from the families and public tear at the very fabric of our democracy and erode trust in our government.”

In the aftermath of Rep. Michele Bachmann’s comments about the Gardasil shot causing mental retardation, vaccine lobbyists and the pharmaceutical-friendly establishment media have launched a new hoax claiming the vaccine is completely safe, despite the CDC’s own figures confirming over 18,000 cases of adverse reactions.

The HPV vaccine has become a presidential campaign talking point, after Ron Paul slammed rival Rick Perry when he pointed out that the Texas Governor’s former chief of staff was a lobbyist for Merck at the same time Perry mandated all girls in Texas receive the shot with an executive order.

However, the controversy only intensified when Rep. Michele Bachmann told the Today Show that a mother had approached her after last week’s Republican debate and told her that her daughter became mentally retarded after receiving the HPV vaccine.

This prompted vaccine advocates, several of whom have direct ties to Merck Pharmaceuticals to circulate the hoax, with the enthusiastic support of the corporate press, that the HPV shot is completely safe and has no side-effects whatsoever.

“Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Pennsylvania Bioethics Center, offered Bachmann $10,000 if she could produce solid evidence of a case in which a “vaccine victim” developed a mental disability following an HPV shot,” reports CBS News.

“Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record,” responded the American Academy of Pediatrics in a statement.

Vanderbilt University’s Dr. William Schaffner also told ABC News, “The HPV vaccine and other vaccines are wonderfully safe vaccines, they’ve been tested extensively and we’re quite comfortable in saying they’re safe.”

Schaffner’s level of comfort in asserting the vaccine is safe may derive from the fact that his National Foundation for Infectious Diseases has given awards to the inoculation-pushing Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as Paul A. Offit MD, a vehement vaccine promoter who holds a $1.5 million dollar research position at a Merck funded children’s hospital and owns several patents on vaccines.

However, the Center for Disease Control’s own figures clearly illustrate how the HPV shot is not “wonderfully safe” at all, as its Merck-linked proponents claim.

The CDC’s own figures show that there have been “18,727 reports of adverse events following Gardasil® vaccination,” including 68 deaths. The report also details the link between the vaccine and blood clots, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, as well as fainting, nausea, and fever.

In attacking Bachmann for citing anecdotal cases of the vaccine causing “mental retardation,” the pharmaceutical establishment has launched a sophisticated hoax aimed at manipulating the public to believe that the vaccine has no side-effects whatsoever, when in reality it has been directly connected with deaths, pregnancy complications, convulsions, seizures, and a host of other serious health problems.

The video report below documents numerous personal accounts from young women and girls of Gardasil vaccine damage, as well as an interview with vaccine expert Dr. Russell Blaylock outlining the dangers associated with the shot.

172,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions Chase Bank as the actor responsible for closing the accounts of conservative commentator Martina Markota and Chairman of the Proud Boys fraternal organization, Enrique Tarrio.",True,The article discusses the actions of Chase Bank in closing the accounts of Martina Markota and Enrique Tarrio.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"In yet another attack from a heavy-hitting banking institution against a person who has expressed public opinions different from those of the bank’s corporate leaders, Chase Bank has given the boot to conservative commentator and performance artist Martina Markota.

Markota has appeared in the 2011 short film “Steam Punk and the Next Generation,” the 2018 science fiction short film “Surrender,” and the 2018 sci-fi mystery “Threading.” She is a reporter for The Daily Caller who made a “notorious” YouTube video about Pizzagate that attracted a lot of criticism from the pedophile community whose members are currently being exposed in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere.

Markota is also an avid supporter of GOP President Donald J. Trump.

In a letter dated January 24, 2019, Chase Customer Service provided this “Important Information” to Ms. Markota: “We have decided to close your account.”

The JP Morgan Chase Bank letter said that only Markota’s bank and/or investment accounts were being terminated, but any auto, mortgage, and/or student loan or lease accounts would remain open. (Must collect more high-rate interest, after all.)

Markota contacted her bank by phone but was refused any reason why her account had been summarily closed:

“They refused to tell me why. They said they have the right to end our relationship and not tell me why.”

The closed account contained more than $34,000, the amount Markota had raised through an Indiegogo campaign to fund a graphic novel she had in the works at the time.

Two weeks before denying banking service to Markota, in February 2019, Chase Bank informed Enrique Tarrio, Chairman of the Proud Boys fraternal organization, that he had until April Fool’s Day (April 1) to move the funds in his personal bank account elsewhere.

The Proud Boys website explains what this group is all about – defending the traditional American way of life:

“The basic tenet of the group is that we are ‘Western chauvinists who refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.’ Like Archie Bunker, we long for the days when ‘girls were girls and men were men.’ This wasn’t controversial even twenty years ago, but being proud of Western culture today is like being a crippled, black, lesbian communist in 1953.”

American Left-leaners over at the U.S. Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) have branded the Proud Boys who support Western culture as a hate group. Founder Gavin McInnes has filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.

Markota believes that she is the latest victim in what Big League Politics rightly terms “financial fascism” – the act of “de-platforming” a customer who has done nothing wrong except have a vocal opinion.

Evidently, the lesson learned by Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg – that it doesn’t pay to alienate half of your customers based on their political beliefs – was lost on Chase executives. The mega-corporation continues to target customers with conservative views by denying them service and shutting down their financial accounts.

Jamie Dimon is Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in America. Dimon also serves on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Under his steerage, last year America’s biggest bank came out swinging against the 2nd Amendment and gun ownership.

On April 13, 2018, Marianne Lake, Chief Financial Officer of JPMorgan Chase, told reporters, after first-quarter earnings results were released, that business dealings with gunmakers “have come down significantly and are pretty limited.”

Lake went on to say that JPMorgan Chase has “robust risk management practices and policies associated with” fighting our constitutional right to keep and bear arms – and has had “for a number of years.”

As Alex Jones of Infowars says, there is a WAR on for our minds.

“Help fight the culture war by supporting what I do. The left have made it a mission to blacklist me because I am a right-winger. They want to banish any right wing artists and ideas, help fight by being my Patron. Thank You.”

As Victor from California asked the Alex Jones Show:

“After what Chase bank is doing to conservatives, should I close my account?”

It does seem like turnabout is fair play. Can you imagine what would happen to Chase Bank’s stock if half its account holders simply walked away in political protest?

Perhaps Mr. Dimon should have a wee chat with Mr. Zuckerberg about the consequences of actions. Just sayin’."

The Agriculture Ministry had been flooded with complaints from private citizens, farmers and organised groups, alleging that airplanes using the British Bases on the island are actually spraying chemicals, known as chemtrails, with sinister motives.

Kouyialis wrote to the House Environmental Committee after he received a letter from EKA farmers union Panicos Hambas, who demanded an explanation.

“At first glance and without actual proof, it appears that these activities could have an impact on the regional climate, since they possibly would be modifying the earth’s composition or chemtrails could potentially threaten the ability of the atmosphere to produce rain” said Kouyialis in his letter.

“We are gravely concerned, because lately we observe extreme weather phenomena, like today’s temperatures” said Hambas during the hearing committee.

Green Party MP George Perdikis says that the suspicions held by many that chemtrails are a real problem in Cyprus are, in fact, “gaining ground”."

The Wuhan coronavirus, which we now know was engineered by the very same Wuhan laboratory that was receiving millions of dollars in NIH funding under the Obama administration, is the ultimate dream of depopulation globalists like Bill Gates, as well as his sock puppets Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx who have staged a Big Pharma coup at the White House.

This is why it’s now crucial for humanity to take a stand against the Big Pharma criminal cartel and reject mandatory vaccines. It’s time to arrest and prosecute all those engaged in the “death science” industry that’s the real agenda behind the vaccine industry front.

And read this astonishing story by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. from Children’s Health Defense:

Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vaccination ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control of global health policy.

Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems to be fueled by a conviction to save the world with technology.

Promising his share of $450 million of $1.2 billion to eradicate Polio, Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously.

In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of global polio cases were vaccine strain.

In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Merck, on 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.

In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a phase 3 trial of GSK’s experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,949 children.

During Gates’ 2002 MenAfriVac campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates’ operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Approximately 50 of the 500 children vaccinated developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.” Nelson Mandela’s former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philanthropic practices as “ruthless and immoral.”

In 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO saying, “We must make this the decade of vaccines.” A month later, Gates said in a Ted Talk that new vaccines “could reduce population”. In 2014, Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a “tetanus” vaccine campaign. Independent labs found a sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade. Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines.

A 2017 study (Morgenson et. al. 2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP vaccine is killing more African children than the diseases it prevents. DTP-vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of children who had not yet received the vaccine. WHO has refused to recall the lethal vaccine which it forces upon tens of millions of African children annually.

Global public health advocates around the world accuse Gates of steering WHO’s agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases: clean water, hygiene, nutrition, and economic development. The Gates Foundation only spends about $650 million of its $5 billion dollar budget on these areas. They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.

In addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, and PATH, Gates funds a private pharmaceutical company that manufactures vaccines, and additionally is donating $50 million to 12 pharmaceutical companies to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine. In his recent media appearances, Gates appears confident that the Covid-19 crisis will now give him the opportunity to force his dictatorial vaccine programs on American children.

Will the Russian collusion hoaxsters, such as James Comey and Andrew McCabe, ever be prosecuted in the seditious acts they committed on President Trump? More reports are coming out from DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz that are making it increasingly hard to ignore the malfeasance of many top government officials in making up a totally fake story to try to remove President Trump from office.

 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: ""By siding with Iran, the Europeans would serve their own and our interests."" n an interview with SPIEGEL, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad discusses the Holocaust, the future of the state of Israel, mistakes made by the United States in Iraq and Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: ""By siding with Iran, the Europeans would serve their own and our interests.""

 SPIEGEL: Mr. President, you are a soccer fan and you like to play soccer. Will you be sitting in the stadium in Nuremberg on June 11, when the Iranian national team plays against Mexico in Germany? Ahmadinejad: It depends. Naturally, I'll be watching the game in any case. I don't know yet whether I'll be at home in front of the television set or somewhere else. My decision depends upon a number of things. Ahmadinejad: How much time I have, how the state of various relationships are going, whether I feel like it and a number of other things. SPIEGEL: There was great indignation in Germany when it became known that you might be coming to the soccer world championship. Did that surprise you? Ahmadinejad: No, that's not important. I didn't even understand how that came about. It also had no meaning for me. I don't know what all the excitement is about. SPIEGEL: It concerned your remarks about the Holocaust. It was inevitable that the Iranian president's denial of the systematic murder of the Jews by the Germans would trigger outrage. SPIEGEL: First you make your remarks about the Holocaust. Then comes the news that you may travel to Germany -- this causes an uproar. So you were surprised after all? Ahmadinejad: No, not at all, because the network of Zionism is very active around the world, in Europe too. So I wasn't surprised. We were addressing the German people. We have nothing to do with Zionists. SPIEGEL: Denying the Holocaust is punishable in Germany. Are you indifferent when confronted with so much outrage? Ahmadinejad: I know that DER SPIEGEL is a respected magazine. But I don't know whether it is possible for you to publish the truth about the Holocaust. Are you permitted to write everything about it? SPIEGEL: Of course we are entitled to write about the findings of the past 60 years' historical research. In our view there is no doubt that the Germans -- unfortunately -- bear the guilt for the murder of 6 million Jews. Ahmadinejad: Well, then we have stirred up a very concrete discussion. We are posing two very clear questions. The first is: Did the Holocaust actually take place? You answer this question in the affirmative. So, the second question is: Whose fault was it? The answer to that has to be found in Europe and not in Palestine. It is perfectly clear: If the Holocaust took place in Europe, one also has to find the answer to it in Europe. On the other hand, if the Holocaust didn't take place, why then did this regime of occupation ... SPIEGEL: ... You mean the state of Israel... Ahmadinejad: ... come about? Why do the European countries commit themselves to defending this regime? Permit me to make one more point. We are of the opinion that, if an historical occurrence conforms to the truth, this truth will be revealed all the more clearly if there is more research into it and more discussion about it. SPIEGEL: That has long since happened in Germany. Ahmadinejad: We don't want to confirm or deny the Holocaust. We oppose every type of crime against any people. But we want to know whether this crime actually took place or not. If it did, then those who bear the responsibility for it have to be punished, and not the Palestinians. Why isn't research into a deed that occurred 60 years ago permitted? After all, other historical occurrences, some of which lie several thousand years in the past, are open to research, and even the governments support this. SPIEGEL: Mr. President, with all due respect, the Holocaust occurred, there were concentration camps, there are dossiers on the extermination of the Jews, there has been a great deal of Germans are responsible for it. If we may now add one remark: the fate of the Palestinians is an entirely different issue, and this brings us into the present. Ahmadinejad: No, no, the roots of the Palestinian conflict must be sought in history. The Holocaust and Palestine are directly connected with one another. And if the Holocaust actually occurred, then"

The headline is Biden may not have been stellar, but he held his own against the field. In my estimation, there was really no real standout during the debates. There was just more Marxist/communist/socialist ideas proposed with few details on how to pay for it all. Of course, gun control was a major topic, which is a hallmark of genocide and Marxism. In all, a pretty unappealing list of ideas from a very unappealing field.

Former FBI Assistant Director Andrew McCabe looks like he will be indicted by the Department of Justice (DOJ). This revelation comes after the DOJ rejected McCabe’s appeal to avoid criminal prosecution. McCabe is on record saying he basically would not go down alone if charged for things like lying to investigators. This was an effort to conceal how key government officials invented the total hoax of Donald Trump colluding with the Russians to win the 2016 Presidential election. Legal experts say this is the beginning of many charges coming for the “Russia Hoax” conspiracy perpetrators.

Who is she?

Her sister is Anne and Anne is married to Google co-founder, Sergey Brin. Susan is also worth ~$400 million — and she’s very smart, and she’s been the CEO of Youtube since 2014. However, after the elections, the free speech mood over at YT changed and Susan promised to do something about it. She promised to crack down on fake news and also demonetize hate speech. Because the platform is so big, she deployed machine learning idiot robots to do this. The subsequent result was the complete destruction of the Youtube community. People who’ve made their lives on YT, professional vloggers, went from making hundreds of thousands to almost nothing at all. The iBankCoin channel, which is now suspended for posting “hate speech” in the form of a CNN interview, went from netting monthly revenues of $4,000 to a few hundred bucks. Lucky for me, I don’t need that money.

This is what Youtube suspended our account over.

So off Susan went, furthering and deepening her crusade against what she deemed to be hateful speech. She has since expanded that mantra to include ‘conspiracy’ videos. I imagine ‘fake lunar landing’, 9/11 was an inside job, the illuminati runs the world’, and everything you needed to know about ‘aliens’ videos will soon be deleted from Susan’s website.

Because she said so.

You’re a dumb goat and cannot make good decisions, so she’ll make them for you. Don’t worry, it’s a private company and they can do whatever they want, just like the electricity company is private and can shut off your lights if they felt like it. Quit being anti-capitalist.

In the event she doesn’t remove your video, she might just myth bust it with links posted to your video, against your will. And, there’s nothing you can do about it.

How is Susan able to accomplish this gigantic task?

During supper she asked her brother in-law, Sergey, if she could hire 10,000 people to ‘clean up’ Youtube and he thought about it, whilst rapidly swishing some Bordeaux in his wine glass, and then he said yes. She then asked if she could employ the ultra-left leaning Southern Poverty Law Center to help clean it up and again he gave it some thought, and then his wife Anne touched his hand and looked at him and said ‘please sweet heart, do it for me’ and again he said yes.

The net result has been scorched earth ever since, with thousands of right of center content providers being ‘accidentally’ purged.

The one silver lining in all this is the likelihood that we’ll never have to see a flat earth video again, no matter how interesting it might be.

“Hillary sold Safe Access Programs to overseas donors. Possessing them alone makes her guilty of treason.”

“So between what was on the servers, the Davey Crockets, the lifted restrictions, the $150 Billion, there is enough evidence to convict the Obama’s and the Clinton’s and many more members of the government of high treason.”

“This is high treason. Nuclear information sold to our enemies. Punishable by death. This is why all democrats, all republicans and all media was against Trump. They all know what happens now.”

How do I know? Because I stayed an extra day after the conference and the countless people I ran into, who attended the conference, told me so. As I was told, many attendees, stated that they were still processing the lessons learned into an evolving personal paradigm.

Every single presenter made an impression on me. There were some because of what I thought I knew going into the conference, had a little more of an impact because of my personal beliefs and this article is a short summation of the personal impact the conference had on my beliefs.

On the final day, I shared the stage with Pastor Paul Begley and Steve Quayle and we discussed the important “lessons learned” from the very knowledgeable presenters, but most of all, we discussed where America and the world are headed. I was intrigued the diversity of our views, however, we all agreed on the destination of humanity. All three of us agreed that the personal decision on whether to get involved in today’s struggles is an irrelevant concern. Mankind is in a war and is already under severe attack. Every human being has a decision to make. Do we collectively cower in the corner and take our beating? Or, do we put on the armor of God and stand boldly and rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus. All three of us agreed that because of our inherent freedoms, all Americans are the immediate targets of Satan. The rest of the Satanic world wants us dead.

There were some presenters, due to my personal paradigm, that spoke directly to my heart. The first was Mike Adams. I have previously written, several times, about the fact that the earth is being terraformed. Mike Adams taught me how correct I was, but he expanded my awareness and filled in a lot of the gaps in my thinking. I was entertained, but shaken to the core by Mike’s presentation.

During Steve Quayle’s presentation, I found myself in a state of cognitive dissonance. Steve’s film crew interviewed geologists from academia and they confirmed what Steve has been saying: Cascadia’s volcanoes could produce a collective cataclysm in which the Pacific plate is moving under the North America plate. When this happens millions of west coast residents won’t be experiencing an earthquake, they will be experiencing the partial displacement of a continent. The end result could be the end of all life west of I-5. And this part of Steve’s presentation was just the warm up act. In Steve’s visits to some ancient cultures, the artwork clearly depicts the alien race we call the Greys. Depictions of space travel were prevelant. And, as we are seeing in modern times, cannibalism was accepted. We are experiencing a “back to the future” moment as many leftists are telling us we must eat each other to save the planet from climate change.

If I talked to everyone of the conference attendees about their paradigm shift, resulting from this conference, everyone would have a slightly different answer. However, the common reaction to the conference was the impact the presenters had on personal belief systems, but also the conference provided a reaffirmation of the redemptive power of Jesus Christ.

181,True,"The article suggests that the Federal Reserve is intentionally manipulating the stock market to benefit certain presidents and punish others, indicating a conspiracy.",True,The article mentions the Federal Reserve as the actor responsible for manipulating the stock market.,True,The article describes the actions of the Federal Reserve in creating and contracting the money supply to influence the stock market.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to suggest a pattern of the Federal Reserve manipulating the stock market to benefit certain presidents.,True,The article implies that the Federal Reserve operates in secrecy and answers to no one.,"The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet shows that in September, the Fed decided to re-elect Trump… and the money pumping began in earnest

The stock market is a rigged game, of course, and current stock prices don’t even reflect real corporate earnings. Instead, they most closely echo the rise and fall of quantitative easing, a form of artificial money creation by the Federal Reserve.

The Fed uses its money creation powers to either boost presidents it wants to keep in power (like Clinton and Obama) or punish presidents it wants to see removed from power (like Trump, initially).

Barack Obama’s economic policies were disastrous, but he still managed to preside over a rising stock market thanks to the money creation policies of the Fed.

In fact, the Fed’s own charts reveal exactly how this works and what they’re trying to achieve.

Go to this link at FederalReserve.gov (which is a misnomer, since the Fed is a private corporation and not part of the government):

The link is called “Recent balance sheet trends” and shows you the Fed’s balance sheet, in trillions of dollars, from July, 2007 through December, 2019.

Follow the chart points below to understand exactly what the Fed is doing:

#1) Obama is inaugurated, so the Fed explodes the money supply and creates over a trillion in new assets for itself while it’s pumping money into the economy to try to make Obama look like an economic genius.

#2) The money creation continues throughout Obama’s presidency, helping to counter Obama’s disastrous economic policies that spur job losses and sharply reduced corporate earnings.

#3) Donald J. Trump is sworn in as president. Immediately, the Fed initiates its plan to crash the economy under Trump.

#4) Beginning in early 2018, the Fed begins contracting its balance sheet, destroying the “wealth effect” it had created under Obama, as a way to harm the economy under Trump.

#5) In September of 2019, the Fed reverses course and decides to return to pumping artificial money into the economy.

Look more closely at the following chart, which is zoomed in to the last 6 months:

#6) This is the inflection point where the Fed decides to start pumping money into the system to support Trump’s re-election. A Trump victory is virtually assured as long as the stock market doesn’t crash.

This indicates Trump likely made a deal with the Fed to keep pumping up the false earnings of an over-hyped stock market so that the banksters and financial elite could continue to skim their profits off the money supply.

The Fed, it appears, is now locked in with Trump, and that means Trump is almost certain to win re-election in 2020 if he’s not removed from power first (or assassinated by the deep state).

Note: This does not mean the Fed will be successful in its mission. There are strong warning signs that the market bubble may be entirely unsustainable, no matter what the Fed does with interest rates, quantitative easing and “repo” operations.

Make of this what you want, but have no illusions about the fakery of the stock market and the nefarious manipulations of the Fed, which answers to no one, not even Congress.

Lastly, we are of course in an irrational market bubble that will one day suffer a catastrophic correction, wiping out trillions in fictional “assets” that investors currently think are real. It looks like the Fed is trying to make sure that day of reckoning does not occur until after the 2020 election. If they can prop up the system for that long, it points to an early 2021 market crash.

It seems highly unlikely that the markets can continue to be propped up all the way through Trump’s second term, which means Trump will be blamed for the most severe market crash in history.

Alternately, if a Democrat manages to win in 2020 — let’s say Elizabeth Warren — that Democrat will likely take the blame for the catastrophic crash that was actually inherited from the Obama era money printing of the Federal Reserve.

Whatever you believe, do not suffer under the illusion that the stock market is a fair representation of actual corporate earnings and growth potential. For the most part, the markets simply reflect money creation by the Fed. The fundamentals are long forgotten, which means most investors in America today are living in the era of sheer delusion, having no clue of the events that will sooner or later wipe their “assets” from the books and recalibrate stock prices to reflect the reality of corporate earnings (without endless easy money from the Fed)."

Goldman Sachs, with a degree of insensitivity, has come up with reasons for people to remain sick.

“The potential to deliver ‘one-shot cures’ is one of the most attractive aspects of gene therapy, genetically-engineered cell therapy, and gene editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies,” analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients Tuesday.

“While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.”

Goldman Sachs is marginal only in terms of its ethical stature and its unpopularity. In every other way, it is central to American life. The Powers that Be have decided that Goldman Sachs matters. Therefore, to consider Goldman Sachs is to ask a very simple political question:

What matters? What matters in our society?

When we discuss what matters, we’re really discussing the appropriate order of our moral priority. The structure of our society, top to bottom, comes from how we rank our commitments. Take the annual federal budget, which is the single most unreadable human document until Kanye’s book is published.

Budget questions aren’t just simple debates: in a very real sense, they determine who will live and die. How much money do we spend on bombs? How much money do we spend on homeless shelters? You get the drill.

Perhaps unwittingly, the Goldman Sachs report confirms that our current medical research model is more crippled than we assumed.

Over the past four decades, following the interlocking mantras of “all government is bad government” and “private enterprise is the solution for everything,” our society has handed the reins of medical research over to for-profit pharmaceutical, medical device, and biotech companies.

Most of these companies are publicly traded, meaning their stock is available for trade on the world’s stock markets.

The problem with this formula is that publicly traded companies are mandated by law to be beholden to their stockholders, not the end users of their products. In the case of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, these end-users are sick people, many suffering from hideous diseases like multiple sclerosis.

In the cold calculus of the free-market, the job of drug company executives is NOT to produce drugs that offer the best result for the patients who take them (like, say, cures).

Instead, providing the best outcome for the companies’ stockholders – in the form of ever-increasing profits and ever appreciating stock prices – is the mandated responsibility of these executives.

The story of this revelation, in all its necrotic glory, comes from Ars Technica. The Goldman Sachs theory refers specifically to genetic therapies. Goldman Sachs points out primly that while this might be great for patients and society, it’s not a good outcome for developers looking for good cash flow.

They even go to the trouble of pointing out that a cure for Hepatitis C has a 90% cure rate, and that as a result of curing so many people, profits for one company, Gilead, have gone down from $12 billion to a measly $4 billion. What were they thinking? They even prevented the spread of that nice, highly remunerative and highly contagious disease!

The solution to the terrible risks of medical success is equally elegant: Focus on high incidence diseases where returns will be better. Obviously, Big Pharma isn’t making enough money despite gloating every second about how much money it’s making.

This peanut-vending exercise in a multi-trillion dollar sector is a good example. Perhaps hoping for a few global pandemics might help, or reintroducing nasty diseases through public disinformation campaigns?

The sheer scale of the irresponsibility and greed of the pharmaceutical sector is legendary. Business models are all about exploitation.

There’s no mention of a strong cash flow from reliable, proven cures. There’s not even the suggestion of higher sector values and improved efficiencies from getting the millions of patients out of the hospitals.

This is a classic example of the total detachment of Goldman Sachs and the rest of the world. The thinking simply doesn’t go beyond “make a buck”. If this is thought leadership, what is death? A cost center?

On the same basis, selling people food at affordable prices is wrong. They may come back for more food, but to be on the safe side, if prices are kept high enough, that $2000 packet of Cheetos will cushion the margins and keep the cash flow high.

This is a culture of money-grubbing mediocrity at best. Also, remember this is the sector which will be tasked with dealing with any major outbreak of anything.

The fact that one of the world’s leading financial houses can make an obscene statement like this and get immediate acceptance says nothing good about the future of medicine."

Quietly and without much fanfare, the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), or more accurately the congressionally-sanctioned kangaroo court whose sole purpose is to shield the vaccine industry from liability for vaccine injuries, has essentially admitted that vaccines cause autism. As reported by the Huffington Post, two more children who developed autism following routine vaccinations have been awarded millions of dollars to help pay for the lifetime of specialized care they will need to address their injuries.

The first case involves a 10-year-old boy named Ryan from California who quickly regressed into an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) following routine vaccinations he received between 2003 and 2005, and specifically the combination measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Prior to getting vaccinated, Ryan was a perfectly healthy young boy who was actually quite advanced for his age, according to reports. But after getting the MMR vaccine on December 19, 2003, he rather quickly developed an encephalopathy, or serious inflammation, in his brain.

Ryan’s family and friends testified before the kangaroo court that the cumulative effect of the boy’s receiving multiple vaccines from 2003-2005 caused him to suffer “neuroimmunologically mediated dysfunctions in the form of asthma and ASD,” a claim that the federal government eventually admitted to be true several years later. Ryan’s family eventually received compensation for his “Vaccine Table Injury,” but pertinent details about the case have been sealed, including particulars about whether or not the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agreed with the court’s decision.

You can read further details about Ryan’s case here:

Similarly, a young girl named Emily developed a seizure disorder and a form of ASD known as pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specific (PDD-NOS) following vaccination with DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis), as well as MMR, HiB (haemophilus influenzae type B), and Prevnar (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), at 15 months old. According to Emily’s court filing, the young girl developed a fever of 105.7 degrees Fahrenheit following the vaccines, which developed into seizures, shaking episodes, and a measles-type rash.

Initially, the government attempted to deny that Emily’s injuries were caused by vaccines. The defendants even tried to deny that Emily was even sick in the first place. But it was eventually determined that young Emily had indeed developed an ASD, and the government agreed to settle the case by awarding Emily’s family for her vaccine-induced injuries. In Emily’s case, the government never came right out and admitted that vaccines were the cause of her injuries, but its actions in dropping its defense prove that there is no other logical explanation.

Emily’s case is spelled out further here:

Courts have quietly admitted in the past that vaccines cause autism, brain damage

Back in 2008, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims also admitted that vaccines, and particularly those that contain the mercury-based preservative Thimerosal, can cause autism. A young girl, whose identity was sealed for the family’s protection, was awarded compensation after a series of vaccines caused her to develop severe autism symptoms, including loss of language skills, no response to verbal direction, and no eye contact, among other things.

A year prior, a young boy named Bailey was also awarded compensation after suffering a seizure and developing Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) following vaccination with MMR. Bailey’s family was eventually awarded compensation for the boy’s injuries, which the court reluctantly admitted were caused by the vaccine."

During planning for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the CIA’s Iraq Operations Group kicked around a number of ideas for discrediting Saddam Hussein in the eyes of his people.

One was to create a video purporting to show the Iraqi dictator having sex with a teenage boy, according to two former CIA officials familiar with the project.

“It would look like it was taken by a hidden camera,” said one of the former officials. “Very grainy, like it was a secret videotaping of a sex session.”

The idea was to then “flood Iraq with the videos,” the former official said.

Another idea was to interrupt Iraqi television programming with a fake special news bulletin. An actor playing Hussein would announce that he was stepping down in favor of his (much-reviled) son Uday.

The total US national debt is now $22.012 trillion.

The latest figure represents a jump of more than $30 billion from where the balance stood at the beginning of February.

According to the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the United States’ federal budget deficit will rise by more than $100 billion to reach $900 billion this year. The CBO said in its January report that over the coming decade, deficits will fluctuate between 4.1 percent and 4.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), well above the average over the past half a century.

The CBO also said the federal outlays are projected to increase from 20.8 percent of GDP in 2019 to 23.0 percent in 2029.

The US Treasury Department’s report comes as the federal US government has re-opened after a 35-day partial shutdown, which the Congressional Budget Office characterized as having a modest negative impact on the US economy.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized his predecessor President Barack Obama for greatly increasing the debt during his eight years in office.

As a presidential candidate back in 2016, US President Donald Trump pledged to get rid of the US debt over eight years. The US president suggested that this could be achieved by making better trade deals.

Under Trump presidency, a United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has been negotiated and signed by all three parties.

In addition, Washington introduced a series of imports tariffs on various goods from China, which prompted retaliation measures from Beijing.However, the US public debt grew roughly by $2 trillion compared to early 2017 when President Donald trump took office, according to the US Treasury Department. Moreover, the rate of increase of the debt accelerated after Trump pushed through $1.5 trillion in tax cuts in December 2017."

Disgraced former CIA Director John Brennan attacked Donald Trump during a Monday interview, claiming the president is not ""psychologically capable"" of putting the well-being of the American people first.

Speaking to MSNBC, Brennan questioned President Trump's ability “to put the country’s well-being first,” while dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.

Throughout the interview, Brennan praised former President Barack Obama for his handling of health crises when in office, while bashing Trump.

""You’ve dealt with crises throughout your career in intelligence, real homeland security issues, inside the White House, and in the agency.

""This feels so very different.”

“It is very different,"" Brennan replied.

""And when I was the Homeland Security adviser for President Obama, three months into the administration, we had to deal with the H1N1 crisis.

""And this was a crisis that was obviously identified first inside the United States, not abroad, so we didn’t have time to try to figure out how it should.”

Brennan replied: “It was identified first in April of ’09 and then through the next year, too, because once it subsided over the summer, it came back in the fall and the winter.

""There were about 60 million Americans that were affected by H1N1 virus, with about 12,000 deaths.

""It was different than the coronavirus right now in terms of its transmissibility as well as which demographics were affected by the virus.

""H1N1 infected younger adults much more seriously than the older population. So one of the things President Obama told us, he wanted to have the science, facts, and data drive administration policies and actions.”

“And later on, President Obama had to deal with Ebola,"" Mitchell interjected.

""So he really had two on his watch.”

“Right,"" Brennan replied, ""and he had created then a pandemic office in the White House that has been taken down by the Trump administration.

""So, one of the things I think we see the difference here is that Donald Trump, who throughout his entire life, he’s looked through the world through a prism of how things affect his financial and political fortunes.

""I wonder if he’s psychologically capable to put the country’s well-being first and to subordinate his own interests in trying to spin things in a manner that won’t reflect badly on him.”

“Politics need to be damned at this point,"" he added.

""The health and safety of the American public is most important.

""Now, obviously, we want to make sure that our economy is going to be able to width stand the traumatic hit it seems to be taking right now, but we want to make sure there is truth and honesty coming out from our public officials.

""Certainly from the White House and from someone who purports to be president of the United States.”

We need to draw back the curtain and begin to pay attention to the man behind the curtain. 



There are critical points to understand. Once the world went off the Gold standard, the people now in effect became dead to the Law.. All courts are courts belonging the central banks, being the creditor in any case. A Judge cannot see the substantive Law in relation to a man or woman's God-given rights anymore under public policy. Public policy refers to the bankruptcy/insolvency of that nation.

All charges are against the created Birth Certificate Trust estate/prepaid account recognized by the all capital letter name. 



The person who is charged is NOT the man but his corporate entity account. All the courts want is to settle a public account and they want access to your Birth Certificate trust/prepaid estate account. 



When you argue/defend and a claim, which in commerce is a demand for money, you are in effect saying 'I don't want to pay' and at this point of dishonour there may be more bogus charges/claims come forward due to this. So all legislative acts apply only to these corporate persons, individuals, taxpayers, residents, etc.; and guess what, they are all created fictions of law. They are not real they are created fictions of law.

The idea is not to argue/defend because the living man or woman is not even named as a party in any court action, only the birth certificate/Corporate Trust entity is named. 



That is why it is said that 'arguments are for fools'. This information applies in Canada, Australia, America and anywhere else where a central bank exists. 



So what happens when there is a 'Charge' against someone? An account is created and it must be settled otherwise someone is placed in prison as collateral for that debt. Arguing and defending creates problems.

This is what they do when they create a charge. The courts/agencies use the important concept/principle of 'Bankers Acceptance law'. It is the important concept and principle of primary liability. The newly created charge is created by the 'maker' of the instrument, i.e, lawyer, agency, court or any other third party entity and the bankers acceptance law goes like this, 'The primary liability to 'pay' an instrument rests with the maker ( i.e lawyer, agency, prosecutor, court etc) of that instrument UNLESS someone else (The charged entity) refuses (argues or defends) to pay. 



Under the rules of Admiralty Law, he who brings forward a charge must also bring forward the remedy and that remedy is your birth Certificate/Trust prepaid asset account. The reason they 'falsely charge' people is because they are well aware of the existence of this Trust account and you are deemed to be in control of your estate, operating as a Trustee of that account.



However they will never openly admit to this under public policy and they will always remain silent and refer you to some legislative act and make you think it applies to you.

When they say to you that 'anything you say can and will be used against you', what they are really saying is be careful how you respond to our presentment/claims because you may not know what it is that we are really asking of you! 



They know and understand that all energy comes from the living man who in reality is the creditor, however if you create dishonour they will treat you as the debtor and the debtor has no rights. 



What is the false allegation industry really all about? It is proof that you have in fact an prepaid Trust/estate account created at your birth and evidenced by your birth Certificate. Your birth certificate is evidence of two things: 1) that a Trust does in fact exist and 2) it is a security, which is used as collateral by any government to receive funding from the central banks.

If you understand that the Bible tells us not to charge your 'brother' because you make a debtor of him and this is why those in power know and understand this concept. This is why they created the fiction corporate entity because it is supposed to protect/buffer you.



Once Adam and Eve dishonoured the creator, they were taken out of the Garden of Eden which was no longer a commercial free zone and absolutely everything that is done, is done in commerce involving commercial accounts. 



Ever since then the same principle has applied, creditors are winners and debtors are losers! Were we not told to be the 'head' (creditor) and not the 'tail' (debtor)? Its all about an account, the rest is all illusion, just ask for the bill so that you can do a bankers acceptance by your endorsement of the charging instrument/complaint and proceed to settle and close the account. However be prepared they will test you first.

We as living people no longer know or understand who we are and everything has been inverted upside down. We have lost our identities and once again have given away our birthright for ""bowl of pottage."""

An event so tragic that NO ONE living today will escape? An event so imminent that I can PROVE without a shadow of a doubt that it is going to happen? What would you do? How would it affect your attitude towards life? How would it affect your attitude towards God?

It is indeed true my friend. All humanity will perish over the next 150 years, 99% within the next 100 years, 50% within the next few decades. The loss of human and animal life will be massive. This tragic natural event will be so powerful and widespread that no living creature will escape. Oh the agony! Oh the misery! Oh the tears that will be shed!

What is this event?

I'll tell you in a moment, but I still want to share a few thoughts with you before I tell you. I was shocked when I fully realized this coming disaster. Though the Bible speaks about coming judgments and chaos upon the earth in the Book of Revelation, I did NOT discover this impending disaster in the Bible. This coming cataclysmic event CANNOT be remedied, it cannot be avoided. Scientists and Astronomers have released public warnings over the past few years warning us about the possibility of a meteorite striking the earth. The Bible confirms this prediction... it will eventually happen, but it will not wipe out the human race. Howbeit, the event of which I am warning you certainly will wipe out every person alive today! It is coming! You cannot run and hide!

We hear concerns in the news about SARS, AIDS, global warming, nuclear weapons, smallpox, weapons of mass destruction, overpopulation, terrorism, etc. The world is afraid of the boogie man, while the greatest enemy to our existence lurks right under our nose, like a predator just waiting for the right moment to take us out of this world.

In December of 2004, over 220,000 people suddenly lost their lives due to a killer Tsunami which devastated many Asian coastlines. The world was shocked, numb for days. We just couldn't believe that such loss of life was possible from a natural event. Some people still speculate that a nuclear bomb was detonated under the ocean, which regenerated a massive tsunami wave (just as there is evidence indicating that Hilo's 1946 killer Tsunami was caused by nuclear testing). Yet, these tragic events cannot compare to the billions upon billions of people who will die due to a natural event over the next 150 years. Would you like to know what this event will be?

It is none other than DEATH itself.

There are an estimated 6,000,000,000 people living upon the earth today... EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WILL BE DEAD IN 150 YEARS!!! Think about that. If you'll perform some basic math calculations, you'll discover that over 250,000 people die ON AVERAGE every single day in this world. Most of those people die without Christ and go to hell according to the Bible, the Word of God. This means that billions of people are going to Hell without Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. Are you a born again believer? Have your sins been forgiven by the only one Who can forgive sin—Jesus Christ? If you are not 100% sure that you are going to Heaven when you die, then I beg you to read the following article on how to be born again. Nothing will matter 100 years from now except whether or not you died in the Lord with your sins forgiven. If not, then you'll die in your sins and end up in hellfire. Please read the article and consider becoming a Christian. It's Heaven or Hell. Jesus Christ is the ONLY Way to Heaven! Will you receive Him now?

This Scripture alone condemns the Iraqi invasion. Whereas God commands us to execute JUDGMENT OF TRUTH and PEACE; The White House under the Bush administration executed judgment of lies and misinformation. You don't invade and destroy the sovereignty of a nation based on some unfounded rumor. The Bible teaches to make war on GOOD ADVICE. Proverb 20:18, “Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.” We certainly didn't pursue any peaceful path in the matter.

Furthermore, God commands us NOT to imagine evil in our hearts against our neighbor. The average American has been led to despise, loathe and hate the Arab nations, because of lying propaganda by the newsmedia and Zionism. It is pure evil what the U.S. and coalition forces have done to the Iraqi people. They are no freer today than they were when Saddam Hussein ruled over them.

A deafening silence on report of one million Iraqis killed under U.S. occupation When those responsible for the American war in Iraq face a public reckoning for their colossal crimes, the weekend of September 15-16, 2007 will be an important piece of evidence against them. On Friday, September 14 there were brief press reports of a scientific survey by the British polling organization ORB, which resulted in an estimate of 1.2 million violent deaths in Iraq since the US invasion. This staggering figure demonstrates two political facts: 1) the American war in Iraq has produced a humanitarian catastrophe of historic proportions, with a death total already higher than that in Rwanda in 1994; 2) those arguing against a US withdrawal on the grounds that this would lead to civil war, even genocide, are deliberately concealing the fact that such a bloodbath is already taking place, with the US military in control. The reaction to the ORB report in the US political and media establishment was virtual silence. After scattered newspaper reports Friday, there was no coverage on the Friday evening television newscasts or on the cable television news stations. There was no comment from the Bush White House, the Pentagon, or the State Department, and not a single Republican or Democratic presidential candidate or congressional leader made an issue of it. On the Sunday morning talk shows on all four broadcast networks the subject was not raised. This was not because those involved were unaware of the study, which received wide circulation on the Internet and was prominently reported in the British daily press. Nor was there any serious challenge to the validity of the study’s findings ... What does the pursuit of “success” mean in the context of the reports of 1.2 million violent deaths in Iraq since the US invasion and occupation? It means the devastation of that country will continue until the American and international working class intervenes to put an end to it. A deafening silence on report of one million Iraqis killed under US occupation

The U.S. is being exploited by The Council On Foreign Relations. Now Iran is next on our road to tyranny. Our children are being exploited as paid mercenaries in the military, our economy is being hollowed out by the evil Banksters, our borders remain wide open, our homes are been confiscated, ours jobs have all been sent to foreign soil, wickedness abounds, and no one seems to care anymore. America is fast headed for a Police State!

We will get what we deserve as a nation for our complacency. Woe unto the United States for our wickedness and rebellion against the holy God of the Bible. God will not be mocked. The Bible says that God hates bearing false witness and hurting our neighbor. Where are those Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq? They've never been found. And what does that have to do with stealing all their oil?

The Council On Foreign Relations is owned and controlled by a bunch of criminals thugs! They've hijacked our government in America, placing their greedy global agendas over American sovereignty. They'll do anything to make more money, even sell out their own people and oath of office. If another nation did to us what we've done to Iraq, we'd be outraged and hellbent on revenge. The newsmedia are a bunch of highly paid liars and manipulators. So many lawyers are the scum of the earth and are controlled by the same Tower of Power that controls the banks and Wall Street.

This is the spiritual wickedness spoken of in Ephesians 6:12, “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” But rest assure, God will punish the wicked for their evil. It's just a matter of time. No one can escape death and judgment in eternity. Isaiah 13:11, “And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.” Amen and amen!"

It looks like the MSM wants people to die, unless it’s someone like CNN’s Chris Cuomo, who admitted this week he took a form of HCQ to get over his Covid 19 infection.

The U.S. economy is severely damaged, and nowhere is that more evident than the commercial real estate market. The biggest mall in America is in big financial trouble, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. The Covid shutdown has bankrupted many businesses, and that is going to be a lingering trend while America tries to get back to work.

He sent a letter across Canada to multiple politicians voicing his concerns over the chemtrail phenomenon. We are told that they are simply airplane engine condensation trails, but now it is clear these trails are different from what they used to be.

Instead of dissipating quickly, they spread across the sky, expand and remain in the atmosphere for a very long period of time. Chemtrails are said to consist of tiny particles of harmful toxins like Aluminum and Barium, Vander Zalm claims there is a potential link to increased rates of Cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and more as a result of the spraying.

Bill is well aware that programs beyond the control of government is a reality. Governments are deliberately kept in the dark on projects conducted by defence intelligence agencies and many of these agencies hire private contractors and corporations to assist them. Because they hire private contractors, there is absolutely no oversight from congress. The CIA and NASA are now backing the National Academy of Sciences in regards to Geoengineering projects(0)(5). Geoengineering projects are any attempt to alter the way the planet or its weather systems operate. It’s a response to what has been labelled as ‘the global warming phenomenon.’ It is complete climate control and the manipulation of it (1)(2)(3)(4). Geoengineering might soon be labelled under “national security,” in which case techniques and methods used will be kept classified without the public knowing what is transpiring.

Geoengineering has been a topic of interest for multiple universities across the planet. They’ve even started to develop specific programs for geoengineering, like Oxford University recently did(6). As mentioned earlier, the fact that the CIA is now involved means that all geoengineering techniques could be kept classified. This is a disturbing thought. One of the proposed techniques for combating global warming is spraying light reflecting aerosols into the atmosphere. Here are some words from the Former premiere, Bill Vander Zalm, who is extremely concerned about geoengineering projects taking place without the public knowing.

I believe it’s been going on for sometime, but to what extent and how much the government knows about it, I don’t know. Chemtrails are happening all over the world, just exactly who’s engineering all of this I don’t know and that’s exactly what i’m trying to find out. Governments do things without asking, and we find out about it when it’s too late. If they don’t give me the information, then i’ll take it further. The Aluminium and Barium is very light, it stays in the air and they say it reflects the sunlight back into space, they say they are hoping to combat global warming with it. Unlike contrails, chemtrails spread and stay in the air for a very long time. What goes up comes down, if we inhale the stuff, perhaps that’s why we have so many problems with alzheimer’s, autism and MS. I have asked municipalities to pass a resolution that if there is any program geared toward climate change, and if anything is sprayed in the air it is done with public consent. Somebody needs to be out there speaking out about these things(7)

What is he hinting at? These are pretty alarming statements given the reputation of this man. Does he know more? I’m glad to see more and more people with a voice in the mainstream world speaking up.

This is alarming, because at the same time multiple scientists all over the planet seem to agree that what we label as man-made global warming is in fact not well understood like we think it is. The founder of the weather channel strongly agrees that man-made global warming isn’t real. Scientists have even suggested that global warming has stopped and planetary temperatures have actually been cooling.

From my research, I’ve personally concluded that temperature changes are a result of the natural cyclical nature of planet Earth. I do believe pollution is a great cause for concern, that it impacts health and damages our environment and it’s critical systems. However, I do not believe that it is connected to warming the planet. I believe that global warming is another “crises” manufactured in order to propose a solution that fits an agenda the “elite” have been playing out for years. The problem has been labelled as global warming, and the proposed solution is geoengineering.

Some corporations and elitist groups thrive of off planetary conflict. There has been a lot of evidence to suggest that many world events and causes for concern are created by the elite, so they can then propose the solution. One example (out of many) was 9/11, create a false flag “terrorist” attack in order to justify the invasion of Iraq and other middle eastern countries, even though they were not involved with anything having to do with 9/11. Could global warming be another problem proposed by elitist groups in order to propose the solution of geoengineering? Could this link to chemtrails? What is the real agenda behind chemtrails?

I highly recommend these two videos if you would like to look further into the phenomenon:

Then, in July 2000, she was vaccinated against nine diseases in one doctor's visit: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae.

Afterward, her health declined rapidly. She developed high fevers, stopped eating, didn't respond when spoken to, began showing signs of autism, and began having screaming fits. In 2002, Hannah's parents filed an autism claim in federal vaccine court. Five years later, the government settled the case before trial and had it sealed.

But what these same Big Pharma puppets conveniently fail to mention is that in places like Japan, where vaccination is entirely optional, children are actually much healthiercompared to anywhere else in the world.

Japan not only has the healthiest children on the planet, according to the latest metrics, but also the highest “healthy life expectancy” among all age groups. And at the very same time, Japan also has the lowest vaccination rate in the entire world, which suggests that getting vaccinated actually makes a person unhealthier in the long run.

In the United States, on the other hand, more young children are dying compared to any other industrialized country, including Japan. More American children are dying at birth and in their first year of life compared to their counterparts living in any other country in the West – this, despite the fact that vaccination rates are increasing due to authoritarian mandates like those pushed by Richard Pan in California.

Of the American children that actually survive birth and make it past one year of age, more than half will develop at least one chronic illness throughout their lives – which isn’t the case in Japan, where chronic illness is a rarity. So it would appear as though getting vaccinated actually increases an infant’s risk of getting sick or dying, rather than the other way around.

“The U.S. government, in bed with Big Pharma, is sacrificing our children for profit,” writes Mac Slavo for SHTFplan.com.

Vaccines are harming and killing children – and yes, they DO cause autism

While many American states still recognize that parents have the right to exempt their children from mandatory vaccinations for religious, philosophical, personal, or medical reasons, there’s a big push to eliminate these exemptions across the board, and force everyone to be vaccinated for “public health.”

But does getting vaccinated with questionable vaccines like Merck & Co.’s MMR for measles, mumps, and rubella, really enhance public health? Hardly. As it turns out, there are multiple court cases pending in which whistleblowers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claim that Merck faked efficacy data for MMR to force it onto the market.

They allege that not only is MMR not effective, but it’s also not safe, as it can, in fact, increase a child’s risk of developing autism or some other permanent injury. In a worst-case scenario – and yes, it has happened – MMR can also cause sudden death.

Some public health officials are actually starting to fess up to this. In New Hampshire, for instance, it was determined that a recent measles outbreak wasn’t caused by unvaccinated children, but rather by a vaccinated child who had previously received MMR in accordance with government recommendations.

The MMR vaccine, in this instance, infected the child’s body with measles, which that same child then “shed” onto other children triggering an outbreak. At first, health officials used the scare as ammunition to push mandatory vaccination. But once it was realized that a vaccinated child was “patient zero,” the whole thing magically went away because it made the MMR vaccine look bad.

“What you won’t hear from vaccine advocates or the mainstream media, is that Merck is in court over MMR-related fraud,” Slavo adds.

“All of these risks involved with getting vaccinated are being covered up by government agencies (FDA and CDC) and the politicians simply don’t care. The vaccine industry is for profit and until safety and saving lives is more important than money, the government and Big Pharma will continue to sacrifice our children to line their own pockets,” he adds.

The number of registered cases of Covid-19 around the world stands at 3,002,303 as of Monday, April 27, according to the database maintained by the Baltimore, Maryland-based university. The global death toll has risen over 208,100.

Nearly a third of those confirmed coronavirus cases are in the US alone, along with just over a quarter of total deaths, at 54,938.

This is both more cases and more fatalities than Italy and Spain – the two European countries that were hardest-hit by the outbreak last month – combined. Italy has recorded 199,414 cases and 26,644 deaths to date, while Spain has hit 229,422 cases and 23,521 fatalities.

China, where the virus was first registered in November 2019, has officially reported only 83,912 total cases and 4,637 deaths.

The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11 over the novel coronavirus outbreak. Since then, more than half of humanity has been placed into some form of lockdown in order to combat the spread of the pathogen.

Officially named ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2’(SARS-CoV-2), the virus is believed to be far more contagious than the ordinary influenza. In its most severe form, it can cause pneumonia and is more likely to be fatal among the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been waiting over the past few weeks for an announcement from Verge coin as to who they will be partnering with.

It has now been confirmed that Verge (XVG) and the worlds biggest porn website, Pornhub, are now official partners.

PornHub is one of the highest trafficking networks on the internet with over 3,6 Billion visits per month.

For PornHub’s premium services, it also has one of the most extensive online payment processing systems in the world.

This deal is surely good news for Verge, but will the crypto world agree?

The announcement has been one of the most highly anticipated reveals in crypto this year.

The hype in the run-up to the public unveiling has seen value for Verge currency skyrocket.

The Verge community has been investing millions of their own XVG into the project, operating only on blind faith.

The team behind Verge has also been teasing their followers, adding further to the hype.

Whether you’re a lover or hater (and there’s plenty of both), all agree that the Verge partnership is make or break for this cryptocurrency.

In late March, the Verge developers ran a crowdfunding campaign to raise 75 million XVG.

With just a small window of a few days and very little details about the project, they met their target.

They were raising fund to qualify for a huge new Verge partnership.

The partner was to remain a secret until the target was met, however.

On March 27, Verge lead developer Justin Vendetta (Sunerok) said the team would reveal the partner on April 17.

This delay has caused a wave of speculation regarding the identity of the partner, both positive and negative.

Rumors of the XVG partner quickly spread on social media.

Guesses were ranging from TokenPay to Amazon, yet the Verge team was tight-lipped.

The mention of the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic, in the PDF paper below, is very important because no one is quite clear how that epidemic happened and it could easily have been a biological attack, not that eradication via pathogen is anything new because it was done before with smallpox.

The difference is that this was probably a man made pathogen, not one that existed in nature.

In recent months the mainstream media has had increasing coverage of the Zika virus in Brazil and how it is causing a devastating birth defect called microcephaly. But the media leaves out that pesticides are added to the water and that toxic mosquito nets are in routine use in affected areas. Could this be deliberate population control, and is this a flawed attempt to save the rainforest?

More than half of the world’s rainforest have been destroyed and no one is going to argue that without them humanity is doomed but is the use of pesticides and toxins really the way to go about protecting the planet? I would have to say no on that one. Instead I would say we as people have to challenge the 1% and go back to nature. We have to question everything, stay vigilant and alert and educate those around us.

Take a cold hard look at how sick the population is… look hard at how GMOs and Vaccines are the Holy Grail. Ask yourself is this not by design? Is this not a plan to control and eliminate portions of the world? I don’t think health will ever come from a vaccine, nor do I think the answers to a better way for humanity will come from government.

We have to be willing to be awake, we have to be willing to take back the food supply and to not squander resources. We the 99% have to be the creator of choice because the 1% is arrogant and foolish and if even 10% of this document is true humanity is doomed. Simply put the scientist and government officials are arrogant (many are in it for a Pay Check and a Pension) and such arrogance and selfishness prevents them from seeing right and wrong. It keeps them from seeing that plans, such as this, never go smoothly.

I urge everyone to read the PDF in its entirety and give it some deep thought. I urge this to be your wakeup call to take back the world from the 1% that feels that creating a worse tomorrow is the way to a better tomorrow. (~CW)

The secrecy is seen as an attempt to cover up the damaging data and protect the vaccine industry's bottom line.","In June 2000, a group of top government scientists and health officials gathered for a meeting at the isolated Simpsonwood conference center in Norcross, Ga. Convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the meeting was held at this Methodist retreat center, nestled in wooded farmland next to the Chattahoochee River, to ensure complete secrecy.

The agency had issued no public announcement of the session - only private invitations to 52 attendees. There were high-level officials from the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, the top vaccine specialist from the World Health Organization in Geneva, and representatives of every major vaccine manufacturer, including GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Wyeth and Aventis Pasteur.

All of the scientific data under discussion, CDC officials repeatedly reminded the participants, was strictly ""embargoed."" There would be no making photocopies of documents, no taking papers with them when they left.

The federal officials and industry representatives had assembled to discuss a disturbing new study that raised alarming questions about the safety of a host of common childhood vaccines administered to infants and young children. According to a CDC epidemiologist named Tom Verstraeten, who had analyzed the agency's massive database containing the medical records of 100,000 children, a mercury-based preservative in the vaccines - thimerosal - appeared to be responsible for a dramatic increase in autism and a host of other neurological disorders among children.

""I was actually stunned by what I saw,"" Verstraeten told those assembled at Simpsonwood, citing the staggering number of earlier studies that indicate a link between thimerosal and speech delays, attention-deficit disorder, hyperactivity and autism. Since 1991, when the CDC and the FDA had recommended that three additional vaccines laced with the preservative be given to extremely young infants - in one case, within hours of birth - the estimated number of cases of autism had increased fifteenfold, from one in every 2,500 children to one in 166 children.

Even for scientists and doctors accustomed to confronting issues of life and death, the findings were frightening. ""You can play with this all you want,"" Dr. Bill Weil, a consultant for the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the group. The results ""are statistically significant."" Dr. Richard Johnston, an immunologist and pediatrician from the University of Colorado whose grandson had been born early on the morning of the meeting's first day, was even more alarmed. ""My gut feeling?"" he said. ""Forgive this personal comment - I do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal-containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.""

But instead of taking immediate steps to alert the public and rid the vaccine supply of thimerosal, the officials and executives at Simpsonwood spent most of the next two days discussing how to cover up the damaging data. According to transcripts obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, many at the meeting were concerned about how the damaging revelations about thimerosal would affect the vaccine industry's bottom line. read the rest of the article

Immunizations are ""mandatory"" in the U.S. for all children; 7 visits to a healthcare provider for a total of 32 vaccine mixtures - all before the child enters school. Every year, between 12,000 and 14,000 reports of adverse vaccine reactions are filed with the FDA. These include hospitalizations, permanent brain damage, and death. The FDA estimates that this figure may represent just 10 percent of the true damage being done. In just 7 years (by August 31, 1997), the U.S. government spent more than $802 million compensating moms and dads for brain injuries and deaths inflicted on their children by mandated vaccines.

Young, healthy women who experience amenorrhea, ovarian failure, and infertility have likely been damaged by Merck’s HPV vaccine. A new study published in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health analyzed data on pregnancy outcomes, comparing women who received an HPV vaccine with those who did not. The data analysis is titled, “A lowered probability of pregnancy in females in the USA aged 25 who received a human papillomavirus vaccine injection.”

The study, uninfluenced by pharmaceutical money, analyzed data on 8 million women aged 25-29 living in the U.S. from 2007 and 2014. According to the analysis, conception rates would have fallen by 2 million if 100 percent of the females in the study would have received the HPV vaccine. The study warns that the HPV vaccine has a negative influence on fertility and more research is “warranted.”

Despite mounting evidence of harm, Merck seeks to fast-track Gardasil on new age group

Despite these grave concerns, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently fast tracking the process by which the Gardasil-9 is approved for use in women and men ages 27 to 45. Merck’s application for approval has been granted priority review, and is scheduled for an approval date of October 6, 2018. So, much important information about Gardasil’s risks will be suppressed as the FDA moves quickly on behalf of Merck’s business interests.

When Gardasil was initially licensed, many post-marketing reports poured in, claiming that vaccine recipients endured primary ovarian failure after vaccination. The cases of Gardasil vaccine damage that have been identified and reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) are in excess of 58,000. Many cases have resulted in emergency room visits, seizures, and the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. Additionally, approximately 11,000 cases have been filed, documenting “serious” disability and sudden death. Women should no longer be subjected to Merck’s deadly experimentations. Gardasil is an experimentation because the risks are concealed and the vaccine is fast-tracked for approval. (Related: Merck accused of fast tracking Gardasil for financial gain; judge orders the drug company to prove the effectiveness of this vaccine.)

One of the greatest dangers of vaccination, which is not studied by the drug companies or the FDA, are the prevalence of stealth viruses within the vaccines. While they do not impact the animal tissue in the vaccine or infect the animals used in the vaccine studies, these viruses can be dormant and revert to infectious form in humans. Watch “The criminalization of science whistleblowers: An interview with Judy Mikovitz, PhD.

Aluminum adjuvant: one of the most alarming issues of vaccine science

One of the biggest problems with the Gardasil vaccine is the use of aluminum as an adjuvant. The adjuvant is used to force the immune cells to respond to the antigen in the vaccine. Without the adjuvant, the immune response to the vaccine pathogen would be weak. The problem is that the aluminum is taken up into the immune-responsive cells and is carried throughout the body. This may cause the immune system to attack itself, as the aluminum persists as a threat in the body. This metal causes problems in the brain of humans. Studies show that brain tissue from autistic children contains high amounts of aluminum.

Aluminum is exponentially more dangerous through injection, than through ingestion. To suppress information on the harmful effects of vaccines, the drug companies base their vaccine safety on ingested aluminum amounts, not the impact of injected aluminum. There’s a big difference. Equally disturbing, GlaxoSmithKline and Merck spike their placebos with aluminum adjuvants to make the vaccine appear less dangerous. This shortcut helps the drug companies cut observation periods so they can conceal the risks of aluminum adjuvants in their HPV vaccines.

The devastating, traumatic failures of Gardasil are being suppressed and young women are suffering at the deceptive science of these devilish institutions. Despite the growing body of evidence of harm from Gardasil, Merck is seeking fast-track approval to unleash their vaccine on another vulnerable age group of the population. The FDA, ignoring the evidence of Gardasil’s harm to women’s ovaries and fertility, cannot be trusted to evaluate the drug company’s “science.” A moratorium should be issued on all HPV vaccines until there is sufficient evidence to prove the vaccine is no longer causing ovarian failure, autoimmune conditions, infertility, seizures, and death.

Most Christians read the Holy Bible like a newspaper, never learning how to properly study the Word of God. In 2nd Timothy 2:15 of the trustworthy King James Bible (beware of modern corrupt Bible versions which remove the word “study”), we are taught to “rightly divide” (or dissect) the Word of God. The correct way to study the Bible is by comparing Scripture-with-Scripture, the same as if solving a jigsaw puzzle. You begin solving a jigsaw puzzle by comparing all the outside pieces, which are flat on one side. Likewise, we begin studying the Bible by learning about the 66 books and the general theme (purpose and background) of each book's writing. Of course, God is the Author of the entire Bible and God only wrote one Book!

Genesis 1:1-2 tells us that the world which God created BECAME void. This would explain the ice age. And again, the Bible even calls the earth “old” in Psalms 102:25, “ hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.”

The Young Earth advocates want you to disregard the Hebrew and other Scriptures that expose their philosophy. They surely do not want you to be aware of the marking in the Masoretic Text at the end of Genesis 1:1, indicating the proper translation of the disjunctive “BUT” instead of the conjunctive (or connecting) “AND.” In the manuscript the reading would be: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. BUT (Hebrew “waw”) the earth was (became) without form, and void;” “Was.” The Hebrew for “was” is “hayah.” It is important to distinguish whether the verb “was” is in the manuscript, or if it has been inserted by the translators. It is wonderful that the King James translators made this distinction. When “was” appears not italicized, that indicates it is in the Masoretic Text. When you see “was” italicized, it indicates it does not appear in the manuscripts, but is understood. This is very important to notice when reading your King James Translation which makes this distinction. In Genesis 1:2 where the verb “was” appears twice: first, as part of the Masoretic The Truth About Evolution; Or, Don't Let Satan Make A Monkey Out Of You

That's fascinating! My friend, the Hebrew evidences that God did not make the world void; but rather, something chaotic caused it to become that way. The Hebrew word in Strong's Concordance for the first “was” in Genesis 1:2 means “to exist, that is, be or become, come to pass.” God created the earth in Genesis 1:1 and then it became without form, and void in Genesis 1:2. What happened? Lucifer, that's what! Dr. Younce goes into this doctrine in chapter 10 (page 85)."

It boils down to what we devote our days to: money or God. I equate God with spiritual ideals of bliss, love, truth, beauty, justice and peace. 



St. Augustine once said a man has as many masters as he has vices. This is a form of spiritual bondage. The freedom Jesus spoke of to the Jews was not about an independence from Rome but a freedom from the bondage of sin that was ruling their hearts. The ' Kingdom of Heaven' that Jesus revealed was, as he said. ""within you"". It could not be found in gold, lust, or the things of the world. The Jews around the time of Rome were seditious rioters who thought that their salvation depended only on Israel as a sovereign nation. Jesus knew that this was not the answer to their problem. Just take a look at the sovereign nation of Israel today, do you need anymore proof?"

Williams explains, “You are seeing the economy slow down. Some people are recognizing that. The Fed’s statement a week or two ago . . . many analysts consider that dovish. The Fed knows what’s going on here. They are trying to get rates up a little, but they have a circumstance that they are not out of the woods with the banks. What they are hoping for is maybe the Trump Administration is going to bail them out and stimulate the economy.”

Williams says “The banks are still not healthy. . . . The Fed is still fighting the battle it effectively lost in 2008. Mr. Trump has several problems. One is the economy. One is the long term budget deficit, and the third is the Federal Reserve. The Fed lost control of the system. The system effectively collapsed. They haven’t been able to bring it back to normal.”

Would Donald Trump simply default on the U.S. debt if countries around the world dump U.S. Treasury bonds? Williams says, “That would be an act of default. You don’t want to do that. What Trump needs to do is address the long term solvency issues of the United States. Then he can convince people that, yes, we are going to be able to handle this, and at the same time, take action to stimulate the economy. That could be very bullish for the dollar fundamentally. . . . If they want this to work and save the system, and Mr. Trump will come out of this with his face on Mount Rushmore if he does, he’s got to turn the economy. To do that, he needs to increase government spending in areas that would help stimulate the economy. He’s got to cut taxes, and that is in the works in some form. As part of the process, there very likely will be a widening of the budget deficit, which could kill the dollar and kill people holding Treasuries.”

Williams says Trump must address the “long term solvency of the United States.” Williams goes on to say, “If he does this, the rest of the world will say, boy, they brought things under control, and they would be happy to own the Treasury bonds. I don’t know if this can be done, but this is what you got to do.”

If Trump does not succeed, Williams says, “The problem will be with the dollar. If the system is not brought under control, the rest of the world is going to dump the dollar. . . . The underlying fundamentals have not changed. The U.S. dollar is, in the long term, insolvent. What has changed here is that there is a chance that the Trump Administration can correct it. As far as I can see, this (Trump) is the last chance to correct it.”

She continued by saying,“I don’t think he would have gone in a death smaller than this.It was a death that brought pride to me, my children, my sisters and their children, to all those who love him and have a place for him in their heart.”

Of course, for the instability in her native country the daughter of the fallen dictator accuses the US, but for the Administration of Trump she seems open to that idea.

Trump during his campaign claims that he was against the war in Iraq from the beginning, but that is a blatant lie.

Could Raghad Saddam Hussein also have an affinity for the billionaire businessman, because in July he proposed that maybe Saddam Hussein despite his violent crimes committed against human rights, shouldn’t be dethroned by the US.

During a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina Trump said, “He was a bad guy — really bad guy. But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn’t read them the rights. They didn’t talk. They were terrorists. Over. Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism.”

At the beginning of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Raghad Saddam Hussein fled and is currently living in Jordan. But today she is accused of supporting ISIS by the Iraqi government, which she denies.

She said, “Of course I don’t have any relations to this group [ISIS] and other extremist groups. Moreover, the family’s ideology has no similarities to that of extremist groups.”

“As a proof to this.these groups only became powerful in Iraq after we left the country and our rule ended” she also added.

But this discovery may precipitated new policies and even war in a struggle to gain control over this new technology? And, while this discovery has been startling to modern science, it appears to be nothing new. As stated in Ecclesiastes 1:9 (New International), “What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.”



Today, several scholars have linked this amazing discovery to the mythology and legends of the far distant past, especially in ancient Mesopotamia today known as Iraq.



 Interest in this new technology grew rapidly and by 2003, some researchers were even claiming that the invasion of Iraq made have had more to do with this new discovery than with oil, weapons of mass destruction or regime change. This story of amazing new discoveries, their connection with narratives from the ancient past and the possible role all this plays in current world events is gaining more and more interest within the public. It appears as though these elemental secrets were lost centuries ago, though vestiges of this knowledge may have been passed down through the years by a series of secret societies.



The current story began with David Hudson, a self-styled conservative Republican and cotton farmer from Phoenix, Arizona. By the mid-1970s, Hudson had found farming in the parched baked soil there a hard scrabble. He began to look for other means of making a living even as he began injecting sulphuric acid into the soil in an effort to break up the dry crust. He found that by spraying his soil samples with a cyanide solution, he could obtain traces of metals from the ore, including gold.



“[W]e had been doing soils analysis [when we thought of] this concept of literally piling ore up on a piece of plastic and spraying it with a cyanide solution, which dissolves selectively the gold out of the ore,” Hudson told a Dallas audience in 1995. “It trickles down through the ore until it hits the plastic and then runs out of the plastic into the settling pond. It’s pumped up through activated charcoal where the gold adheres to the charcoal and then the solution is returned to the stack…The concept seemed pretty simple. I decided, you know a lot of farmers have airplanes, a lot of farmers have race horses, a lot of farmers have race cars…I decided I was going to have a gold mine.”



 After checking out several locations, including abandoned gold mines, Hudson found the site near Phoenix he was seeking. “I had a lot of earth movers and water trucks and road graders and backhoes and caterpillars and these kinds of things on the farm and I had equipment operators, so I decided I was going to set up one of these heap leach cyanide systems.”



Hudson got much more than he had bargained for. “[W]e began recovering the gold and silver and we would take the charcoal down to our farm. We’d strip it with hot cyanide and sodium hydroxide. We’d run it through an ‘electro-winning cell’ to get the gold out. And then we would do what’s called a ‘fire assay,’ where you run it through a crucible reduction to get this gold and silver bead….This is the time honored procedure for recovering gold and silver and, basically, its been performed for 250-300 years. It’s the accepted standard in the industry,” he explained.



But, along with small amounts of gold and silver, Hudson also recovered small beads of a material which baffled attempts at analysis. “Something was recovering with the gold and silver [that] we couldn’t explain,” he said.



This “something” turned out to be elements heretofore unknown to modern science, elements composed of a single atom. This monatomic matter is found in virtually everything around us including the food we eat and the water we drink.Hudson found such elements could be retrieved from noble metals such as gold, silver, copper, cobalt and nickel along with platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and osmium.



He also found that the nuclei of such monatomic matter acted in an unusual manner. Under certain circumstances, they began spinning and creating oddly deformed shapes. Oddly, as these nuclei spun they began to come apart on their own."

Though on the surface it may seem like President Donald Trump has it good, politically: He’s a GOP president at a time when he’s also got a Republican majority in Congress. And while Democrats will always be Trump’s biggest political obstructionists, he’s going to get far too much pushback from establishment Republicans who still don’t understand they were given clear mandates by the American people to get certain things done.

One of those things involves dramatically reforming health care—and not like President Obama and the Democrats “reformed” it when they ruled Congress and the White House, a la Obamacare. It’s obvious that some Republican leaders don’t get this, and one of them may be House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Ryan, for some reason, appears to be picking a fight with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence over the administration’s pledge to tackle the corruption of Big Pharma. Every American adult who has had to pay for medications over the last several years knows that they have gone up in price dramatically, and that there seems to be nothing stopping drug makers from boosting prices even on drugs that have been around for a long time.

What’s more, the price increases are only going to get worse this year, as Trump predicted.

In his first press conference in recent days, Trump—speaking at Trump Tower in New York City—promised pharmaceutical industry reforms including proper bidding on prices, among other measures, moving forward, Breitbart reported.

“We have to get our drug industry coming back,” he said. “Our drug industry has been disastrous. They’re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs but they don’t make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because they’re getting away with murder. Pharma has a lot of lobbies, a lot of lobbyists, a lot of power.”

He went on to note that currently, there is very little bidding going on regarding drugs, even though Americans and the U.S. government are the largest consumers of pharmaceutical drugs.

“We’re going to start bidding,” said Trump. “We’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.”

Trump doubled down on his criticisms of Big Pharma later, in an interview with the Washington Post, saying that Big Pharma was “politically protected, but not anymore.”

According to Fortune, Trump’s comments sent the pharmaceutical industry into a financial tailspin. Enter the donor class’ favorite House Speaker, Ryan.

In response, Ryan told Mike Allen of Axios that he wants to “have more conversations about” the president’s efforts to crack down on Big Pharma corruption before it actually happens.

For the record, according to money-in-politics watchdog MapLight, the “Pharmaceuticals/Health Products” industries are one of the top 10 donors to Ryan, contributing $381,979 through June 30, 2016.

“I believe that the current premium support system with Part D works extremely well,” Ryan said. “I think there’s some real success stories … and I think we need to tell that story.”

When Allen asked if that also meant telling the president such stories, Ryan replied that it needs to be told to “a lot of people.”

He added: “I think [incoming Health and Human Services Secretary] Tom Price understands this issue extremely well.”

When he was asked about Trump’s comments that Big Pharma was politically protected, “but not anymore,” Ryan replied, “I don’t speak like that, generally speaking. I’m always looking for win-win situations, and I believe there’s a lot more we can do to bring down the price of drugs.” (RELATED: Stay current on this and other issues dealing with the pharmaceutical industry at BigPharmaNews.com)

The tension is more of the kind we’ve seen since the nationalist/populist Trump—the first real president “for all the people” in several generations who wants to stand up to the globalists, crony capitalists and corporatists—began rubbing up against the elitists who ‘run things.’

The Washington political class has never had to deal with anyone like Trump as president. He is not one of them, so he doesn’t view issues and problems through the same politically compromised prism as they do. Trump’s idea of “win-win” isn’t a “bipartisan agreement” per se, it’s any deal that helps as many Americans as possible (especially those who, up to now, have not had a voice in D.C.) while saving the government money and making it more efficient.

The ruling elite see “win-win” as anything that makes it appear as though they’re ‘doing something for the people,’ while actually doing something for the donors who keep them in power.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, and the Democratic leadership.",True,"The article discusses actions such as retaking the House, demanding the old guard step aside, impeaching the President, challenging moderate Democrats, and trying to rein in Rep.

Then, the great divide between the states was the issue of slavery. Today the great divide among Democrats is the new breed of radical young socialists who have infiltrated the party, demanding that the old guard step aside.

This obvious tug-of-war for control within the party surfaced soon after the 2018 midterm elections ended, with young self-described Socialist/Democrat freshmen like media darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) openly challenging the newly elected 78-year old Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Ironically the real agenda for Democrats after their historic win isn’t creating new legislation, but rather to impeach the President. They were elected to stop Trump, to block him at every turn, and lead the effort to remove him from office.

The leadership is banking on the Special Counsel, to provide whatever slim assumptions or conjecture that something may have transpired between the Trump campaign and Russia.

And while that is the main agenda for Democrats, equally important to the new freshmen class of radical progressives is the eventual removal of their much older and less progressive colleagues within the party.

Which brings us back to our 16th President’s “A house divided against itself, cannot stand,” speech and the potential for open rebellion within the Democratic Party.

Progressive groups are already taking aim at those moderate Democrats; ironically the same ones that helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez get elected, moreover getting ready to challenge moderate Democrats in 2020, hoping to expand their Social/Democratic agenda in Congress.

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), one of those Democrats perhaps feeling the heat from the radical left, spoke out concerning where his party is heading, “I’m sure Ms. Cortez means well, but there’s almost an outstanding rule: Don’t attack your own people.”

Adding, “We just don’t need sniping in our Democratic Caucus.”

However, Cleaver’s words seem to be falling on deaf-ears, as another newly elected radical freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), exploded on Tweeter saying we’re “going to impeach the mother**ker” referring to the President.

That classless crude however blunt statement caught Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic leadership off guard, in that it blew the lid wide open, regarding the House’s real agenda.

And now, they’re trying to rein in perhaps the most publicized radical freshman of them all, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who has more than 2 million Twitter followers and counting.

The party bigwigs have told her to tone it down. However Ocasio-Cortez is a new breed of Democrat who doesn’t follow the party line, in fact when told to cool-it by Pelosi and company, Alexandria took to twitter referencing Alan Moore’s Watchmen, “None of you understand. I’m not locked up in here with YOU. You’re locked up in here with me.”

That quote perhaps best illustrates where the Democratic Party is right now, almost mirroring where America was in 1858, just two years before the civil war.

Incumbent Democrats are especially enraged by the young socialist’s threat to back primary opponents against members of their ranks she deems too moderate, and against their new set of House rules.

However, perhaps their biggest fear is that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is in some bizarre way, in the same mold, as the person they’re attempting to impeach.

“There’s a lot of people in the Democratic Caucus. When we are courageous enough to just puncture the silence on an issue, they will start to move. Don’t people realize that the most powerful position you can be in when you are not materially attached to a position of power? If you’re a one-term Congress member, so what? You can make 10 years worth of change in one term if you’re not afraid,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez."

In the wake of the Islamist terror attacks in France against cartoonists and Jews, former President Jimmy Carter’s first reaction was to pin the motivation for such terrorism on Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. Appearing on “The Daily Show” Monday, Carter was asked by host Jon Stewart whether the violence the world saw on the streets of Paris was actually fueled by something else other than Islamic extremism.

“Well, one of the origins for it is the Palestinian problem,” Carter replied. “And this aggravates people who are affiliated in any way with the Arab people who live in the West Bank and Gaza, what they are doing now — what’s being done to them. So I think that’s part of it.”

Carter didn’t explain how solving the Israeli-Palestinian issue would in any way resolve the violent conflicts currently engulfing the Arab world, including the Syrian civil war, the Islamic State’s takeover of part of Iraq and its brutal implementation of Islamic law, and the conflict between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood, just to name a few.

 April 30 (King World News) – Peter Boockvar: The discrepancy between the stock market and the US Treasury market is glaring again just as we’ve seen before. I believe the stock market seems to be mostly focused on the direction of the economic improvement that will come with a reopening while the Treasury market is likely more focused on the degree of that improvement.

… After the Fed touted all the tools that they’ve unleashed while Jay Powell reminded the fiscal authorities of their importance here, ECB President Lagarde today is likely to take the same approach. After also sharply increasing the size of their balance sheet with many hundreds of billions to go (they will add about 1 Trillion euros on this go around), Lagarde will again press governments for more fiscal help. We’re getting it but it will be her way of saying there is only so much the ECB can do.

The title says it all . . . Everything They* Ever Told Me Was a Lie. Completing a work that took four years, Shannan’s book is a blockbuster, spanning the past half-century and covering the unknown facts about the JFK assassination and the still-growing Apollo 11 controversy of the 1960s to 9/11 and the Obama citizenship hoaxes.

Everything They* Ever Told Me Was a Lie explains from the outset exactly who “they” are (only the newest of AFP readers wouldn’t already know) and how a cooperative news media, by ignoring facts and refusing to address pertinent questions, allow outrageous lies to meld into definite, indisputable truths.

It is bad enough that we cannot trust our politicians to tell us the truth—an age-old problem—but when a cooperative news media not only fails to investigate and continues to perpetuate these fabrications, even after the reported facts have long been proven wrong, a whole nation of people winds up totally confused by a corrupted few.

Investigative journalist, author and radio show host Pat Shannan has been in pursuit of the truth for nearly half a century. Intrigued by the deception and on-going cover-up of the JFK assassination, he began to notice a similar pattern in the 1968 murders of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy. Then he found altered and intentionally fabricated FBI official reports regarding these and other cases and began to notice the cooperative news media ignoring blatant and pertinent facts as well.

The films of Ronald Reagan exiting the Washington Hilton clearly show Secret Service Agent Tim McCarthy being shot by someone other than John Hinckley, Jr. And what are the odds that the greatest potential beneficiary of Reagan’s demise would be the close friend and business associate of John Hinckley, Sr.? Why did the wounded Reagan arrive at the hospital 15 minutes after Jim Brady, when his limo left the scene five minutes before Brady’s ambulance?

How could Arthur Bremer fire seven shots from a five-shot revolver the day he nearly killed Gov. George Wallace and three innocent bystanders in 1972? Why was Pat Tillman murdered in Afghanistan in 2004?

Shannan has long maintained that the hidden power behind the expansion of the central government has been the unconstitutional use of legal tender that is produced at will, and herein proves his case. He also shows that government plots survive because of little or no investigation, and only through the aid of a cooperative news media can such ridiculous conspiracy theories as the 9-11 official story not only survive but thrive.

With his latest work, Everything They Ever Told Me was a Lie, Pat Shannan shows us examples of myriad goings-on behind the scenes and how nearly every story of importance is carefully crafted into a benefit for the power elite and a detriment to “We the People.”

The corporate news media’s “Investigative Reporting” of today actually amounts to merely discovering and publishing the best words and pictures to most benefit the on-going cover-up of the current problem.

For Shannan, no subject is off limits. In this book Pat takes a look at the mainstream cover stories for some of the biggest events of the 20th century and then provides us with the REAL STORY. He examines these top stories and a lot more such as: the censored history of lawful money vs. the FED’s counterfeit legal tender; the unverifiable past of Barack Obama, the actual two Oswalds; George H. W. Bush’s close family connection to the would-be assassin of Ronald Reagan; the inside forces working with OKC bombers; LBJ’s shocking admission of assassination involvement to his mistress; how “they” framed James Earl Ray, Sirhan Sirhan, L. Harvey Oswald (rather than Lee H.) and actually murdered Vince Foster and former NFL football star turned fighting patriot Pat Tillman.

Someone, speaking of the wars of mankind, said a long time ago that “the winners get to write the history.” That being true, those writers win again with each reading by anyone and will continue to win until someone such as Pat Shannan comes along to deracinate the lies and supplant them with truth."

Why do we care about the Ukraine? We care about Ukraine because it’s a gateway to oil. It’s a gateway to Eastern Europe. It’s a gateway to control a situation politically, but also for our banking system to get involved from a financial perspective. Putin understands Ukraine is a gateway, as well. Russia backed a lot of the larger Russian banks . . . to fund oil and infrastructure and to basically take over the roll the U.S. banks and European banks were starting to have in the Ukraine.”

The Middle East is the same scenario. Prins says, “Russia has backed pipelines in Iraq. Lukoil is involved in projects there that have billions of dollars of money attached to them. U.S. banks also see the potential for billions of dollars of, not just oil money, but financing, or what’s called project financing, of the pipelines in Iraq. There is an $18 billion pipeline project and Citi Group wants to finance that. Citi Group set up a bank in Iraq last year to be able to do that. Citi Group has a $2 billion contract with Boeing financing airplanes with Iraq. So, there are a lot of other components in that region that are still in flux.”

Prins, who was also a top Goldman Sachs banker, says there are big risks for bankers in the Middle East and warns, “What could go wrong is we could get into another five or ten years . . . of civil war with multiple factions of terrorism in the area that we cannot possibly have control over. The fact that we are even having this conversation, the conversation in Washington is going on about ISIS, means we have no control over the situation. . . . The United States has been trying to pick the faction that is going to be most friendly for decades, and the faction that is most friendly is the one that is supposed to support the opening of the area for financial and resource purposes, and that doesn’t always work! It often leads to heightened terrorism and heightened aggression against the United States and its citizens. We come in and make that unstable situation even more unstable.”

Prins goes on to say, “These are areas everybody wants to control for resource purposes, as well as financial infrastructure purposes, and to change and open these countries in such a way so that is available to both Russia and China as well as to the U.S. in the future. That’s what’s at stake here. . . . Nobody really wants to have a third world war. That’s expensive and deadly, but this fighting over financial political gain is really continuing to crescendo. It’s crescendoing because there is so much money on the table and because the economies involved, ours, China’s, Russia’s, are really all weaker than any government wants to admit on the surface.”

On the so-called recovery, Prins contends, “We are not even stable enough as it is. We haven’t created enough jobs for the population growth since the crisis in 2008, regardless of what the percentage numbers say, and most of us know that. What the market has been growing on is zero percent interest rates for the past six years. It’s the same thing in Europe. . . . The central banks are not going to be raising rates because they can’t. The only thing keeping any semblance of economic positivity for corporations, individuals and markets is the fact that money has no cost. . . . The reality is the jobs aren’t there. This is artificial. The money isn’t funneling into the average citizens in any of these countries, and that creates instability. Which is, again, why all these gateway areas are so important. . . . There is a lot at stake here globally.”

The reality is it will go all the way around the world within two days because party “A” will not pay party “B” who doesn’t pay party “C” and on and on we will go. The payment chain will break. . . . I’d like to get back to the point of true and real settlement. If nations don’t settle honestly amongst each other, that is how your trade wars start. That’s how one neighbor believes another neighbor is ripping them off. This is how wars start, and that is what this is about: the rest of the world wanting to trade and wanting to do business mutually and evenly and getting paid for trade. In the past with the dollar, the U.S. has gone into many places; and after the deal was unfair, they paid with dollars, which is an un-backed freely printed currency. That’s what the world is upset about. That’s what this tipping of the balance is about.”

Holter goes on to point out, “Greece has got to be hidden. The fact that they are broke cannot come out. If Italy or Spain or anyone else were to default, that would be calling a spade a spade. Once the daisy chain breaks, it will lead all the way to the West, and it will lead to London and it will lead to New York. It will lead to the fact that the gold is gone. That’s the great fault. That is the fault at the core of all of this. That’s why they are kicking the can and kicking the can because it can never be discovered that the gold is gone. Once that is discovered, it’s over.”

So, what will it look like to the man on the street when the next crash happens, Holter predicts, “On the streets here in the U.S., you are probably looking at total chaos. . . . Once the banks go, especially in the cities, you are going to see complete chaos because the average person has about three days of food stocked up, or maybe five days of food stocked up. When the banks go down, distribution will stop. When distribution stops, the stores, and you just saw this in the northeast, the stores are wiped out in a day or two. They have just-in-time inventories. It’s not like they have loaves of bread sitting in the back waiting to be put on the shelves. Once distribution stops, the shelves will not get replenished. Truckers will not be paid, and you can take that all the way down to the farmer. Everything is run on credit, and once credit stops, it’s over. When it’s over we have 48 or 50 million people on food stamps . . . those people don’t have any food stocked away. So, there is an immediate 50 million people who will be out on the streets looking for food. . . . If you go back to the Great Depression, you had bread lines. There are bread lines today, but the lines are the little EBT cards, and there are 50 million of them. . . .All is not well because we have 15% of the population who can’t even feed themselves.” How long would people have to be on their own until the government got credit lines running again? Shockingly, Holter predicts, “I would say the absolute minimum would be three months. Yeah, I think three months is the absolute minimum to get things back to ‘normal.’ . . . It’s hard to say. Again, with what’s going on, I would give it a 60% to 70% chance of a major financial collapse before the end of the year and the jig being up.”

“Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.” 2 Thessalonians 2:9,10 (KJV)

If someone would have told me just ten years ago that Satanists would be given a voice and a platform in this country to spread their devilment, I would have thought you were crazy. Absolutely nuts. But in 2016, Satanists like the LGBT are on the rise, empowered, and looking for a fight. Why? Because the Bible says that in the end times darkness and evil will rise as the professing Church of Jesus Christ grows ever more lukewarm. Welcome to the end times.

Satanists Michelle Shortt and Stu de Haan submitted a request to give the invocation at the February 17 meeting of the council, reports AZCentral.com. Though members of the city council objected to such a “prayer,” the city has decided to let the satanists continue as scheduled.

Phoenix City Attorney Brad Holm released a statement Thursday evening, defending the city’s position on the issue.

“Consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s direction, the city cannot dictate religious viewpoints or the content of a prayer,” Holm wrote. “In addition, government may not exclude a denomination or a religion from praying under these circumstances.”

The invocation at the start of Phoenix City Council meetings has been given by representatives of various faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Sikhism.

“We’re citizens of this government and we would like our voices to be heard,” de Haan said. “If they don’t want to accept, constitutionally what must happen is that all voices must be taken down from the public forum. It’s basically all voices must be heard or none at all.”

De Haan added the satanists “don’t intend on doing anything offensive.”"

Native American wannabe and political grifter Elizabeth Warren has been caught in yet another campaign lie, this time pertaining to her alleged legal work on behalf of breast implant victims injured by products made by Dow Chemical.

Despite claiming that she worked on behalf of these victims when she still practiced law privately, Warren actually went to bat for Dow Chemical, it’s now been revealed – which directly contradicts Warren’s claim that, if elected president, she’ll work on behalf of the American people to fight Big Pharma.

It was back in 2012 when the group Legal Insurrection first began uncovering the truth about Warren’s erroneous claims, revealing that “Pocahontas,” as she’s been named by President Trump, isn’t exactly being honest about her past legal work.

Instead of fighting for the little guy like she now pretends to have done before entering the political arena, Warren was actually an ally of major corporations, and worked on their behalf against the interests of patients, consumers, and the public she’s now pandering to as she attempts to become the first female president in 2020.

It was none other than The Washington Post that recently broke the news about Warren’s lies, which were quickly buried after President Trump tweeted about “The Squad,” sparking a multi-week melee over his alleged “racist” sentiments against Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), and Ayanna Pressley.

“The WaPo report should have been massive news, particularly with the second Democratic debate coming up this week,” wrote William A. Jacobson for Legal Insurrection.

“It should have been the subject of other news coverage about Warren’s private legal practice, and other Democrat presidential candidates should have been talking about how it works against Warren much as Joe Biden’s past is used against him.”

While it’s no secret that politicians routinely lie, Warren’s whole life seems to be a lie

But because of “The Squad” fiasco, the Warren story quickly dropped out of the news cycle, even though it arguably holds top priority as we move towards the 2020 presidential election cycle.

It’s important to note that the WaPo piece in question was hardly an act of mudslinging against Warren, seeing as how its author, Annie Linskey, has long come to Warren’s defense on other issues, including the claim that she’s of Native American ancestry.

According to Linskey, Warren never used this claim to “get ahead” in life. But Linksey also now admits that Warren isn’t being truthful about the type of legal work she was involved with, and is misrepresenting herself to potential voters.

“The point of all this is that Linskey is someone with whom the Warren campaign has been willing to share information, and who the campaign has cited favor with,” adds Jacobson.

“Linskey cannot in any way be construed as hostile to Warren, so the findings of the latest investigation cannot be attacked by Warren and her supporters as a smear by a ‘right-wing extremist.'”

As it turns out, Warren worked on at least 56 different legal cases during her time as a Harvard Law School professor, charging as much as $675 per hour for her services – this number being far higher than what the Warren campaign has been claiming.

Back in 2012, Warren, who was then running for the Senate, released a list of only 13 cases she had worked on, omitting the many dozens of others that have since come to light. We also now know that, concerning Warren’s alleged Native American ancestry, her ancestors were actually members of a militia that separated Cherokee children from their parents.

According to Jacobson, Warren has a pattern of only disclosing things that she thinks people already know. And as the public learns more about what she’s not disclosing, she “acts preemptively to get ahead of bad news.”"

Is the recent jump in gold prices confirming this? Sinclair says yes and predicts a two-tier reset in the next few years. . . . The first will be a devaluing of the dollar. Sinclair explains, “The reset has already started. . . . The only thing holding up the dollar is its universal use as a contract settlement mechanism in Russia and China and everywhere else, and that simply is not happening anymore. . . . The dollar is going lower. . . . In the first reset, the dollar will get sliced in half. That means the little guy will get sliced in half in terms of his buying power. You need to look at gold, not a speculation, but as a savings account. If the dollar gets sliced in half, you basically double the value (of your gold) if not more. I think much more. . . . In the second reset, that will take gold to a price where it will balance the ability to pay global debt. That’s the major move coming forward. Right now, we are definitely going back to the $1,850 and $1,925 area per ounce for gold. The second reset, you can pick any price you want for gold. Pick a high price.”

With the national debt officially at $22 trillion, and the additional “missing” $21 trillion discovered by Economics Professor Mark Skidmore at Michigan State University in 2017, you have a huge amount of debt and dollars floating around. This fact makes Sinclair’s prediction of $50,000 per ounce gold a few years ago look conservative. Bill Holter has done the math and says it simply must go much higher. Holter explains, “If you take the 8,300 tons the U.S. supposedly has, and I did this math last year when the official national debt was approaching $21 trillion, gold would need to be $87,000 per ounce to cover just the on books debt. I am not talking about the “missing” money, not future guarantees, pensions, Social Security and things like that. . . . So, the number is $87,000 per ounce for gold or multiples of that. What’s going to happen? The people who are running this understand this as much as we do, and the system is going to go down. So, why not create a false flag and kick the table over so you can point at it and say our policies would have worked if it wasn’t for whatever event they come up with.”

Can they put this off until after the 2020 election? Holter says, “It just might be one big last kick of the can . . . but prepare yourself and prepare your family. Have extra food. Have a way to purify water. Make a plan where you can go it alone for a couple of weeks or a couple months or more. That is what is coming for us all. Trump is going to preside over a bankruptcy. When he was elected, we predicted that he would preside over the bankruptcy of the United States. . . .The math says it is guaranteed.”

Sinclair says, “He is a master at bankruptcy. You maintain the item that is a producing asset, and you ‘jubilee’ or get rid of debt that has failed. You go through with a machete and take everything down that does not produce. . . . We have been warning people to be their own central banks and be able to take care of themselves for no less than 90 days.”

There is systematic suppression in the United States on the truth about the links between vaccines and autism. Drug companies and the federal government have conspired to deny parents of vaccine-damaged children their day in court by creating a kangaroo “vaccine court” that offers no due process whatsoever (and therefore violates the civil liberties of Americans).

Even so, this court has, numerous times, admitted that vaccines have irrefutably damaged children and caused autism. Parents of those children are offered “hush money” to quietly go away after signing an agreement that mandates they never talk to the press about their ordeal.

This systematic suppression of the truth about vaccine-damaged children is revealed in a must-see new video just released by the Canary Party (www.CanaryParty.org) and narrated by actor Rob Schneider, an outspoken advocate of parental rights when it comes to medicine.

Or see it on TV.naturalnews.com at:

I urge you to share this video with everyone you know! It explains, in clear, rational language, an important part of the true story of how the vaccine industry suppresses the truth about vaccine-damaged children.

Brought to you by the Canary Party

The Canary Party is a fast-growing movement of parents, doctors, scientists and everyday citizens who want to put a stop to the systematic poisoning of the population by drug companies, vaccine manufacturers and other corporate pushers of toxic substances that damage humankind (and the planet).

Click here to read the position paper of the Canary Party. You’ll find that it is based on the scientific “precautionary principle” as well as fundamental parental rights and individual responsibilities. In summary, the Canary Party seeks to reveal the truth about how we are all being poisoned by unethical corporations and then find constructive ways to stop the poisoning and end the human suffering caused by it.

Regular readers of NaturalNews will find these principles to be quite familiar, as we share these same goals. I plan to work with the Canary Party in the near future to find other ways we can help support their cause for humanity.

The entire vaccine industry — including all its bought-and-paid-for doctors, authors, “scientists” and PR flaks — has for decades knowingly lied to the world in claiming that vaccines have “zero risk” and “zero side effects.”

In truth, even the CDC still admits that vaccines contain four additives, each of which is a potent neurotoxic chemical. Those additives include:
• Mercury (still used as a preservative)
• Aluminum (used as an inflammatory adjuvant)
• Formaldehyde (used to “deactivate” live viruses)
• MSG / Monosodium Glutamate (used to caused immune system inflammation)

All of these substances are toxic to human biology when injected. There is no rational doctor or scientist in the world who can say they believe injecting infants and children with mercury, formaldehyde, MSG and aluminum is somehow “safe,” yet doctors inject children with these substances every single day in the form of vaccines.

Just as the dental industry has for decades ridiculously denied the toxicity of mercury in dental fillings, the vaccine industry is also living in delusional state of total denial about the toxicity of mercury. What we are witnessing today with modern medicine is a vaccine holocaust that is killing and maiming our children in record numbers. And the “circle the wagons” strategy of suppressing all the scientific evidence to support this makes Big Pharma look even worse than Big Tobacco.

At what point will autism reach 1 in 10 children? It’s not that far off (it’s already over 1 in 100 children born today). If this level of disease were caused by anything other than vaccines, the CDC would have long declared it an epidemic and tried to push a vaccine for it. But because autism is linked to vaccines and mercury, the CDC downplays it and ridiculously pretends children aren’t being harmed. The FDA plays the same game of denial, hoping no one will notice as the condition multiplies to the point where one day potentially every fifth child in America will be autistic after receiving the hundreds of “required” vaccines that will be mandated in the near future.

We are talking about the downfall of a nation here, folks. If this vaccine holocaust is not stopped, America will not survive. No nation can survive the collapse in the health of its citizens. Injecting mercury into the population of America is just as idiotic as feeding the citizens of Rome drinking water laced with lead. Many historians say the lead poisoning of the citizens of Rome exacerbated its downfall. Today, vaccines are strongly contributing to the same sort of downfall of modern civilization.

Under the auspices of their imperial “New Middle East” project, the criminals (U.S–led NATO, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Israel, are targeting everything that they falsely profess to cherish.

All of the “values” that the politicians falsely parade as important, even sacrosanct, are instrumentalized as false fronts that belie the dark undercurrents dragging humanity towards a barren “New World Order” of globalized degeneracy and despair.

Nation-state self-determination, sovereignty, territorial integrity – all vital components of world peace, prosperity, and democracy are meaningless to the elites, except for their propaganda value.

A meta-national project of top down control, enforced by anonymous elites, controls how we think, feel, and live.

Prof. Michel Chossudovsky, author of America’s “War on Terrorism” identifies the largely hidden “powers” behind the system as

This dystopian present has rendered political choices moot. Choices are non-choices, puppet shows sold by empty words and conflicting narratives — all bereft of substance.

The real agenda is unspeakable. The real agenda must be unspeakable, because it is poison, a dark distillate of degenerate barbarism, mostly hidden from view.

This real agenda, masked beneath the Big Lies, and the stories told by scripted “politicians”, bares its sanguine teeth, and imposes its dark will with barely a whimper. There are no “mistakes”. It’s all by design.

War planners knew full well that the sanctions imposed prior to the invasion of Iraq were targeting children. They accurately predicted when the plants would fail, and how many lives would be lost.

The end result? Over 500,000 children under the age of five were killed, with intent (murder), in addition to over one million other people, none of whom who had committed a crime.

The “West” regularly targets innocent people, including children, with a view to weakening the morale of countries about to be conquered. Madeleine Albright infamously intoned that the “price (murdering 500,000 children) … is worth it”, in one of the rare moments when dark truths and media messaging intersect.

War planners also knew that they were supporting al Qaeda ground troops in Libya when they exploited the Responsibility To Protect (R2P) clause to bomb the sovereign state of Libya, to assassinate Muammar Gaddafi, to destroy water infrastructure, to loot, to plunder, to commit genocide, and to set up an ISIS strongehold. Prior to the invasion, Libya’s standard of living was the highest in Africa. There were no mistakes.

The weapons ratline from Libya to Syria was not a mistake either. The West intentionally funded its terrorist proxies so that they would be well provisioned to invade Syria. The weaponization and training of its terrorist foot soldiers supplements the terrorists’ now dwindling additional sources of income such as funding from illicit drugs, the plunder of historical Syrian artifacts, the theft of Syrian oil resources, and so on. All planned by the West. Again, no mistakes.

Equally degenerate is the fact that the Western intelligence agencies, allied with Wahhabi Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan’s ISIS, perpetuate the degeneracy by raising new recruits into the culture of the un-islamic, Wahhabi ideology. Chossudovsky explains that,

In 1979, the largest covert operation in the history of the CIA was launched in Afghanistan: With the active encouragement of the CIA and Pakistan’s ISI, who wanted to turn the Afghan Jihad into a global war waged by all Muslim states against the Soviet Union, some 35,000 Muslim radicals from 40 Islamic countries joined Afghanistan’s fight between 1982 and 1992. Tens of thousands more came to study in Pakistani madrasahs. Eventually, more than 100,000 foreign Muslim radicals were directly influenced by the Afghan jihad.

Just as the CIA, through the Pakistani ISI, creates “radicals” by indoctrinating children in “madrasah” schools, so too ISIS indoctrinates Syrian children in the ways of the degenerate Wahhabi ideology in ISIS occupied areas of Syria.

Samuel Westrop writes in “U.K: Jihadists as Charity Workers”, that

The cancer of this un-islamic ideology is intentionally promoted in occupied areas of secular, pluralist, democratic Syria with a view to “weaponizing” children, and to destroying the country with an internalized cancer of Wahhabism and violence.

None of this is accidental. All of it is the fruit of considerable forethought and pre-planning by the imperial “West”, its allies, and their intelligence agencies.

Whereas the West proclaims that it is spreading democracy, it is spreading terrorism, Wahhabism, death and destruction on each and every one of its pre-planned imperial invasions.

Syria’s stand against the Western agencies of death and destruction is a stand for all of humanity against the dark forces that fester beneath our politician’s empty words and the courtesan media’s toxic lies."
233,True,The article suggests that there is a conspiracy by the mainstream media and the vaccine industry to silence and demonize anyone who questions vaccine safety and effectiveness.,True,"The article mentions the mainstream media, vaccine corporations, vaccine industry, and public health officials as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,The article describes the actions of the mainstream media and the vaccine industry to promote vaccines and silence vaccine skeptics.,False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to support the claim that there is a conspiracy to promote vaccines and suppress vaccine skepticism.,True,The article suggests that there is secrecy and misinformation surrounding vaccine safety and effectiveness.,"Newsweek says vaccines have “no health risks,” calls for “trust in science” – who are they even kidding?

Some people have falsely accused Natural News of spreading “fake news” for constantly driving home the fact that the mainstream media routinely and absurdly contends that all vaccines are 100 percent safe and effective all the time, even though vaccine package inserts created by vaccine corporations reveal that there are very real dangers associated with vaccines. But reality has once against proven these folks wrong, as none other than Newsweek recently published a ridiculous op-ed claiming that anyone who says that there are health risks associated with vaccines simply has no “faith in science.”

The opinion piece, which has since gone viral across social media, labels anyone who actually reads vaccine package inserts and asks honest questions about vaccines as an “Anti Vaxxer,” derogatorily accusing those who defect from the “herd” of mass vaccine worship of defying “science.” It’s an increasingly common mainstream media tactic to silence anyone who would dare to challenge official vaccine dogma, and goes right along with the vaccine industry’s agenda to demonize all vaccination defectors.

“‘Anti Vaxxer,’ of course, is the media’s derogatory label for anyone who dares to question public vaccine policy,” wrote Jeremy R. Hammond in a rebuttal piece for JeremyRHammond.com, which was republished with permission by GreenMedInfo.com. “Anytime you see this label being tossed out, you can know with 100% certainty that what you are reading is not a science-based discussion, but pure propaganda.”

Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.

The absurdity of Newsweek claiming that “Anti Vaxxers” are somehow defying “science” is found in the fact that the vast majority of parents who reject vaccines do so either because their own children or the children of others they know have suffered vaccine-related health damage, or they did their own independent research, as opposed to simply gobbling up and digesting the medical establishment’s pseudoscientific lies like the rest of the “herd.”

There’s a reason why more and more parents don’t trust vaccines, in other words, and it has nothing to do with Jenny McCarthy or these mythical anti-science sentiments we’re constantly hearing about. In truth, those who choose not to vaccinate themselves and/or their children have studied up on real science that the establishment never talks about, which contradicts everything that the Cult of Vaccination is disseminating and spreading as “fact.”

“[T]he problem is emphatically not that people are losing their faith in science,” Hammond explains in his rebuttal. “On the contrary, it’s that they recognize that what public health officials and propaganda rags like Newsweek say science says about vaccines and what science actually says are two completely different and mutually incompatible things.”

“They recognize that, when it comes to vaccines, the mainstream media prefers to do public policy advocacy instead of journalism,” he adds.

Barbara Rath, the writer of Newsweek’s propaganda piece, heads a pro-vaccine think tank working on behalf of Big Vaccine

It’s important to note that the author of Newsweek‘s pro-vaccine propaganda piece is a woman by the name of Barbara Rath, the co-founder and chair of the so-called “Vienna Vaccine Safety Initiative,” a pro-vaccine propaganda think tank that exists solely to promote and push vaccines whenever, wherever, and however it can at the behest of the vaccine industry.

In other words, Rath’s goal with her article in Newsweek isn’t to present actual science in defense of her and the magazine’s pro-vaccine position. It’s merely to push more vaccines on the gullible masses by denigrating those who rightfully and honestly question vaccine safety and effectiveness in the interest of public health.

“Rath’s motive is illuminated further down the page, where she opines that ‘Restoring trust in vaccines and immunization requires innovative solutions …,” Hammond adds. “Notice that she’s dropped the pretense of restoring faith in science and just stated flatly that it’s faith in public vaccine policy that she’s really after – and these are two mutually incompatible aims.”"

In case you were wondering what the real plans are for people who oppose the quack science dogma of the vaccine industry and its child murdering vaccine advocates, look no further than today’s rant from anti-Trump neocon Rick Wilson.

“Anti-vaxxers are a scourge and a strong argument for re-education camps, the immediate seizure of their property, and putting their children into protective custody,” tweeted Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson), a neo-con Republican strategist and so-called “never Trumper.”

This demand sums up the medical police state tyranny and anti-human authoritarianism that characterizes vaccine advocates, almost all of whom are “medical child molesters” who maim children for profit. They quite literally seek to throw parents in concentration camps if they refuse to have their children injected with nearly a hundred toxic vaccines that contain neurotoxic substances such as aluminum, squalene, mercury, aborted human fetal tissue, formaldehyde and even complete DNA sequences of aborted human babies whose genes were genetically engineered to cause cancer.

Here’s a screen shot of the tweet, since Rick Wilson is likely to delete it soon:

And here’s the live tweet, if you wish to respond to it (and haven’t yet been banned by Twitter for daring to oppose vaccine tyranny):

Rick Wilson is a creature of the criminal-minded Bush administration, which engineered the 9/11 attacks to put in place Patriot Act expansions of deep state surveillance to spy on the American people in the name of “national security.” As explained by Pulpitandpen.org:

Wilson is best known as being the Republican strategists who served as George W. Bush’s Florida campaign chief during the hotly contested 2000 Florida presidential campaign re-count. Wilson was an appointee to the Department of Defense by then-Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney. He has also serve Rudy Giuliani’s mayoral campaigns and recently wrote the book, Everything Trump Touches, Dies. He has been a columnist for The New York Times, The Federalist, and Daily Beast.

President Obama came on national media this week and said ISIS terrorists in eastern Syria and western Iraq “will find no safe haven,” and he wants to “ultimately destroy ISIL.” Of course, Secretary of State John Kerry said it really was not a war but a “significant counter-terror operation.” To that I say horse hooey! This is war any way you cut it, even if it is supposedly only an air campaign with military “advisors.” Just think, President Obama won a Nobel Peace Prize at the beginning of his first term. Will he have to give it back? There are so many ways this can go wrong it is not even funny. He said he was going to arm the moderate Syrian rebels. What happens if these rebels switch sides and start fighting with ISIL? What happens if the weapons we give them end up in the hands of terrorists–again? We are going to double down on the strategy that gave U.S. weapons to al-Qaeda and help explode the ISIL terror group that was an offshoot of al-Qaeda. We have no Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq. That means our pilots or soldiers have no immunity if someone is killed by accident. What happens if the fighters we back start losing badly? Are we just going to let them die? Here’s where it really gets ugly. This bombing campaign the President just launched is going to include targets in Syria. The Russians are worried that these Syrian airstrikes may include targets of the Assad regime and not only ISIL terrorists. Russia thinks this may be used as a pretext to weaken Assad. The Russians also charge this is more about getting a pipeline through Syria than it is about fighting terrorism. The pipeline is natural gas, and Qatar wants to start supplying Europe. The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, is worried that a bombing campaign could lead to a “huge escalation in the conflict in the Middle East and North Africa.”

Speaking of natural gas, Europe is about to have theirs cut off. There are new sanctions coming from the U.S. and the EU over the Ukraine crisis. It’s going to involve Russia’s biggest energy companies, among other sanctions, but the oil companies are the biggies here. Russia will respond, and what do you bet it will involve higher gas prices and less of it this winter in Europe? The European economy is already in a tail spin, and this will surely drive it into a depression. News flash–even the new President of Ukraine says most, if not all, Russian fighters have left the country. Russia says they were never there to begin with, but Ukraine says they are “mostly gone.” So, what gives with the new sanctions? There is a cease-fire in effect between the pro-Russian separatists and the Ukraine army. This just seems like the West wants an economic implosion, war or both. Things are getting worse on this front and not better just as I have been forecasting for weeks. If Europe goes down, you can kiss the global economy goodbye, and that includes the U.S. This, once again, seems too stupid to be stupid. That quote, by the way, is from renowned gold expert Jim Sinclair.

Celente explains, “So, what happens? The markets are going down, and you hear from people like Ray Dalio (hedge fund manager) from Bridgewater Associates saying that the Federal Reserve needs to consider quantitative easing again and more stimulus. All of a sudden, the markets go up because, what happens, Mario Draghi, former head of the Goldman Sachs gang in Europe. . . . . Now, of course, he’s the head of the European Central Bank (ECB). Davos, Dalio, Draghi, three D’s man. Draghi gave these money junkies over there some monetary meth. All of a sudden, Draghi comes out and promises more stimulus on the horizon, folks. Whether it’s the Fed, ECB, China or the Bank of Japan talking about it again—more stimulus. All they are doing is keeping this money junkie, this Ponzi that is addicted to cheap money, alive. At some point, as we saw, it’s crashing and they keep coming up and give it more life.”

Celente predicts, “It’s a global recession and it’s already on. What they could do to prop up the stock markets, I don’t know, but our forecast is they won’t be able to. It’s also very important to understand that the people will not blame Obama for the declining economy. They are not tuned in enough, and they have been pushed down to I don’t care and I don’t believe in hope and change anymore. It will be neutral as to the party preference.”

On the upcoming 2016 election, Celente says, Conservatives aren’t conservative anymore and liberals aren’t liberals anymore. . . . How about ‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors’? Six banks were convicted of felonies for rigging the LIBOR interest rate and rigging the FOREX or currency markets, which is a $5.3 trillion a day market. Not one head rolled. . . . This is what you call a neo-feudal society. The rich get a slap on the wrist, and we get a whack on the head for committing the most minor crimes because we have to obey the law. . . . We see it as Trump and Clinton, at this point, and Trump is not going to get the woman vote. At this point, I think Clinton can beat Trump.”

On the subject of the stability of the banks, Celente says, “The only money I keep in a bank is money to run our business because here is the deal. If there is a terrorist strike, false flag or real, there will be a bank holiday and . . . bail-ins. The global banking system is in a bear market. China . . . Japan . . . . France, bear market . . . UK is in a bear market. We are told everything is going to be okay. I wouldn’t put my money in the banks, and I’ll tell you why. (They’ll say) We got your money and we’ll give it back if and when we want to. Look what happened in Greece. Look what happened in Cyprus. Look what’s going on as the emerging market currencies are collapsing. Look at commodity prices collapsing. Put your money in the bank? Knock yourself out. Speaking for myself, why should I put it in a bank? They give me nothing back, and now they are even talking about negative interest rates. . . . They will charge you to keep it there.”

On a final note, Here’s what Mr. Celente says about Gold to his subscribers: ”

Gold up, while most everything else is down? Why? More quantitative easing is a cheap money-pumping scheme that will, at best, temporarily re-inflate failing equity markets and do nothing to reverse the deepening Global Recession trend. Thus, gold will be treasured as a safe-haven commodity in a climate of central-bank currency destruction and socioeconomic and geopolitical turmoil.”"

The self-professed ‘science guy’ said in a bizarre interview on Wednesday that the older generation are to blame for destroying the planet.

“Climate change deniers, by way of example, are older. It’s generational…We’re just going to have to wait for those people to ‘age out,’ as they say. ‘Age out’ is a euphemism for ‘die.’ But it’ll happen, I guarantee you – that’ll happen.”

Dailywire.com reports: These musings are not only pathetically immoral, they’re anti-democratic – the notion behind a representative republic is that people can be convinced on the issues.

If Nye has failed to convince people that global warming is a catastrophic threat requiring massively burdensome government intervention, that’s his own fault – perhaps he’s too busy producing songs about “My Sex Junk” or cartoons with polysexual ice cream scoops.

But the fantasy of the Left that the demographics of the country will move in their direction if they can just get rid of undesirable populations has a pretty dark undertone: hoping your political opponents croak so that you can win legislative battles without having to win the argument smacks of nastiness.

While conservatives sometimes joke about Leftists having fewer children and then losing the argument through demographics, we’re not actually rooting for it, nor do we think that lack of children from Leftists would be a necessity for political victory.

Yet another holocaust is being repeated right now by the vaccine industry, also run by fascist government much like the Third Reich. Except this holocaust’s impact goes far beyond six million people; it involves the maiming, injury and deaths of hundreds of millions of people around the world, spanning at least three decades.

Just like Adolf Hitler criminalized anyone criticizing his authoritarian regime, the vaccine deep state in America — led by the criminal CDC — has achieved the coordinated censorship of all criticism of vaccines across every tech platform of today: Google, Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter and others. All channels containing content or videos that dare point out the government-admitted statistics of children being killed by vaccines — quarterly stats are readily available via VAERS.HHS.gov — are systematically de-platformed and censored.

At the same time, the vaccine industry continues to enjoy a “special deal” of legal immunity, thanks to the corrupt U.S. government and its complicity with the pharma cartels. No person harmed by a vaccine on the childhood immunization schedule can sue the manufacturer of that faulty product. This means vaccine manufacturers have zero motivation for quality control and can technically put literally any chemical they want into vaccines… including chemicals that cause autism, neurological damage and death.

These two factors — the coordinated censorship of all whistleblowers and the “special deal” legal immunity for vaccine manufacturers — add up to a perfect storm for a global vaccine holocaust that can never be stopped, since no whistleblowers are allowed to be heard.

Defenders of the scientific static quo claim that science is “self correcting.” But there can be no self correction when no voices of dissent are allowed to be heard. Vaccines have become a cult-like “faith” matter across the scientific community, where total belief in vaccines is required at all times, or you will be fired from your job, stripped of your medical license, isolated from research funding, denounced by the medical establishment and censored by the tech giants. No dissent is allowed to be voiced, which means vaccines aren’t “scientific” at all. They represent an absolutist, cult-like fanaticism that smacks of deep intellectual corruption, not rational thought.

No one is allowed to criticize vaccines. No whistleblowers are covered in the media. No investigative findings can be shared on social media. The cover-up is now complete, and the vaccine industry answers to no one, but hopes to violate everyone.

Mass death has now descended upon us, and it’s all being carried out in the name of “science.”

Contributed to TLB by: The Children’s Health Defense Team (CHD)

In our September 18th debate for Spectrum TV, Kaiser’s Chief of Pediatrics, Dr. Robert Riewerts, parroted Pharma’s popular canard that the Gardasil vaccine has eliminated cervical cancer in Australia—the first country to mandate the jab. This is false.

The table shows that Gardasil actually increases the risk of cervical cancer by a terrifying 44.6% among women who were exposed to HPV infection prior to vaccination. If anyone ever bullies you to take Gardasil, look up “Gardasil Vaccine Insert” on your cell phone to see all of the adverse events and show them this table. [From original BLA. Study 013 CSR. Table 11-88, p. 636]

Slide 2: 34% of children ages 2-10 have HPV infection due to non-sexual transmission.

This data shows that nearly HALF OF ALL WOMEN HAVE HAD PRIOR EXPOSURE TO HPV—with 38% being exposed before age 10. (which puts them at an increase of developing cancer if they have the HPV vaccine.) [Journal of Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology, 29(3):228-233, June 2016.]

Slide 3: The results of pap-smears before the pre-vaccination period.

Pap smears drove the dramatic decline of cervical cancer prior to the introduction of Gardasil in four countries. During the 1989-2007 period, the incidence of invasive cervical cancer declined continuously in all countries with pap screening.

Slides 4-8 show a dramatic reversal in that downward trend following the introduction of HPV vaccine (Gardasil). Oncologist Dr. Gerard Delepine, his wife Dr. Nicole Delepine, also a physician, and a team of researchers plotted these graphs from publicly available health data.

Research tracks the INCREASE in cervical cancer in Australia following Gardasil’s introduction.

Slide 5: Cervical cancer increase in Sweden following the start of HPV vaccination campaign.

The same trend as Australia is seen in Sweden. The incidence of invasive cancer climbed from 2011, two years after vaccination campaign. [Graph published by Nordcan 2019 05 29.]

Slide 6: Cervical cancer increase in Norway following the beginning of HPV vaccine campaign.

Norway research shows a similar pattern as Sweden and United Kingdom. [Graph published by Nordcan 2019 05 29.]

Slide 7: Cervical cancer increase in the United Kingdom following the start of the HPV vaccination program.

The United Kingdom also shows a similar pattern. In the vaccinated age group, the incidence of cancer jumped in 2011, three years after the start of the campaign. [Graphic from Cancer Research UK]

The correlation between Gardasil uptake and increase in cervical cancer is just that—a correlation—not proof of causation. Only robust science—not name-calling or censorship—can answer whether, and why, Gardasil may be causing an increase in cervical cancer. Let’s ask social media titans to stop broadcasting Pharma’s propaganda and censoring open debate. Let’s demand that Pharma’s spokespeople support their claims with science.

About Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. – His reputation as a resolute defender of the environment stems from a litany of successful legal actions.

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way . . .”

Every now and then, the world resets.

Sometimes it’s a cataclysm or natural disaster that pushes the reset button. Sometimes it’s a political revolution. Sometimes it’s a war. Sometimes it’s a technological innovation.

Dickens’ immortal “best of times / worst of times” formulation comes from his novel about one such reset: the French Revolution. Dickens’ words capture the dual nature of each fracture point in history. Like the old (and spurious) trope about the Chinese word for “crisis,” a reset presents both a danger and an opportunity.

It is now apparent to all that we have arrived at another world reset. This time we are being asked to believe that it is a viral pandemic that has pushed the reset button. Others would contest that it is in fact the panic over the (presumed) pandemic that is responsible for this crisis. Yet others insist that the p(l)andemic is nothing more than a distraction from the global financial reset which was going to happen regardless.

Whatever the case, the fact remains that the reset button has been pushed. No one knows for certain what lies on the other side of this chasm, but—as we’ve been endlessly told in recent weeks—life will never be the same.

So, following Dickens, let’s explore the dual nature of this global reset and outline the dangers and the opportunities that this crisis presents. . . .

Lindsey Graham has been dragging his feet on his promise to get to the bottom of the Russian collusion hoax.

Graham’s apparent reluctance in calling for senate investigations may have more to do with his long friendship with the late Arizona Senator John McCain, as the primary reason for the delay, in that McCain, despised the President, moreover had an active role in framing the President.

The South Carolina Senator made it clear at the time, that he was fed up with the Democrats lack of urgency and vowed in a much-publicized statement blasting wrongdoers, stating; “When it comes to the FISA warrant, the Clinton campaign, the counter-intelligence investigation, it’s pretty much been swept under the rug except by a few Republicans in the House. Those days are over.”

Time passed, and apparently so did Graham’s desire to investigate those wrongdoers.

However, the lack of urgency by Graham hasn’t gone unnoticed by Fox’s Tucker Carlson who brought up the subject this week with Senator Rand Paul, asking the Kentucky lawmaker why Graham was “slow-walking” the investigation.

Carlson speculated that perhaps Graham’s inaction may be due to a strained relationship between Graham and the President regarding Graham’s “disagreement” with Trump on recent foreign policy decisions, and is thus punishing the President by delaying the investigation, which sounds on its face as an absurdity.

Graham, of course, heads up the Senate Judiciary Committee and is the only one within the committee that can call for an official investigation.

Carlson highlighted how the senator has failed to deliver.

“We’re going to call them all before the committee,” Graham said in a video clip. “Did they try to involve the 25th amendment to take the president down? Did they get a warrant against an American citizen using information that they know was flawed? Did they taint the Clinton email investigation because they are afraid that if they indicted her she would lose the election and they wanted her to win? You’re going to get answers to that to the best I can give them to you.”

He pointed out that neither McCabe nor Rosenstein have been subpoenaed, no investigations have been launched and “now his inaction extends to the Ukraine saga as well.”

Paul weighed in describing the process of calling for hearings within the senate.

“Not just any senator can do this,” the Kentucky Republican said. “So I can’t call committee hearing and drag these people in. Senator Graham has the power. He is the chairman of a powerful committee, the Judiciary Committee. Yes, I’ve encouraged him publicly and privately to do this.”

Paul gave the example of former CIA Director John Brennan and how he would like to see him questioned.

“I would ask him very pointedly, ‘did you talk to the British intelligence agencies and did you set up spying by foreign intelligence agencies on the president or the president’s campaign?’ Because I think he did and I think that’s against the law,” he told Carlson.

However, any investigation conducted would inevitably involve Graham’s long-time friend the late John McCain who was the individual who passed the unverified dossier to the FBI.

McCain’s involvement isn’t clear, except admitting that he received the dossier from someone stating publicly, “Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public.”

Adding, “Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.

“It came from a former British MI6 agent who was hired from a political opposition research firm in Washington who was doing work about Donald Trump for both republican and democratic candidates opposed to Trump,”

However, McCain may have also either passed and or leaked to the media through conduit details within the phony dossier that became public, thus setting into motion the feeding frenzy of a hostile media.

Graham’s loyalty in uncovering the truth may be in conflict with his friendship for McCain who hid the fact he was the source that provided the dossier to the FBI until he was outed, and perhaps more importantly what other secrets he may have hidden."

SEATTLE (CNN) – As President Barack Obama helped Democrats bank millions in campaign cash on Tuesday, he acknowledged his administration is confronting “some big overseas challenges” in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere.

Speaking at a fundraiser in a wealthy enclave of Seattle, Obama said there is a sense among Americans “that around the world the old order isn’t holding and we’re not quite where we need to be in terms of a new order that’s based on a different set of principles.”

Overseas, Israel continues its ground invasion of Gaza and investigators continue to probe the downing of a Malaysia Air jetliner over Ukraine.

Despite the destructive consequences of the 2011 invasion, the West is currently taking a similar trajectory with regard to Syria.

Just as the Obama administration excoriated Gaddafi in 2011, highlighting his human rights abuses and insisting he must be removed from power to protect the Libyan people, the Trump administration is now pointing to the repressive policies of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and warning his regime will soon come to an end — all in the name of protecting Syrian civilians.

But as the U.S. and its allies fail to produce legal grounds for their recent air strike — let alone provide concrete evidence to back up their claims Assad was responsible for a deadly chemical attack last week — more hazards of invading foreign countries and removing their heads of state are emerging.

This week, new findings revealed another unintended consequence of “humanitarian intervention”: the growth of the human slave trade.

The Guardian reports that while “violence, extortion and slave labor” have been a reality for people trafficked through Libya in the past, the slave trade has recently expanded. Today, people are selling other human beings out in the open.

“The latest reports of ‘slave markets’ for migrants can be added to a long list of outrages [in Libya],” said Mohammed Abdiker, head of operation and emergencies for the International Office of Migration, an intergovernmental organization that promotes “humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all,” according to its website.

“The situation is dire. The more IOM engages inside Libya, the more we learn that it is a vale of tears for all too many migrants.”

The North African country is commonly used as a point of exit for refugees fleeing other parts of the continent. But since Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011, “the vast, sparsely populated country has slid into violent chaos and migrants with little cash and usually no papers are particularly vulnerable,” the Guardian explains.

One survivor from Senegal said he was passing through Libya from Niger with a group of other migrants attempting to flee their home countries.

They had paid a smuggler to transport them via bus to the coast, where they would risk taking a boat to Europe.

But rather than take them to the coast, the smuggler took them to a dusty lot in Sabha, Libya.

According to Livia Manente, an IOM officer who interviews survivors, “their driver suddenly said middlemen had not passed on his fees and put his passengers up for sale.”

“Several other migrants confirmed his story, independently describing kinds of slave markets as well as kinds of private prisons all over in Libya,” she said, adding IOM Italy had confirmed similar stories from migrants landing in southern Italy.

The Senegalese survivor said he was taken to a makeshift prison, which the Guardian notes are common in Libya.

“Those held inside are forced to work without pay, or on meager rations, and their captors regularly call family at home demanding a ransom. His captors asked for 300,000 west African francs (about £380), then sold him on to a larger jail where the demand doubled without explanation.”

When migrants were held too long without having a ransom paid for them, they were taken away and killed.

“Some wasted away on meager rations in unsanitary conditions, dying of hunger and disease, but overall numbers never fell,” the Guardian reported.

“If the number of migrants goes down, because of death or someone is ransomed, the kidnappers just go to the market and buy one,” Manente said.

Giuseppe Loprete, IOM Niger’s chief of mission, confirmed these disturbing reports. “It’s very clear they see themselves as being treated as slaves,” he said.

He arranged for the repatriation of 1,500 migrants just in the first three months of this year and is concerned more stories and incidents will emerge as more migrants return from Libya.

“And conditions are worsening in Libya so I think we can also expect more in the coming months,” he added.

As the United States government continues to entertain regime change in Syria as a viable solution to the many crises in that country, it is becoming ever-more evident that ousting dictators — however detestable they may be — is not effective.

Toppling Saddam Hussein led not only to the deaths of civilians and radicalization within the population, but also the rise of ISIS.

As Libya, once a beacon of stability in the region, continues to devolve in the fallout from the Western “humanitarian” intervention – and as human beings are dragged into emerging slave trades while rapes and kidnappings plague the population — it is increasingly obvious that further war will only create even further suffering in unforeseen ways."

It’s “We the People” against “We the Criminal Crony Class.” Forget calling them the “establishment” because they are, in fact, a bunch of law breaking weasels in BOTH parties. Democratic Presidential contender Bernie Sanders would be getting much the same treatment as Donald Trump if he would have done as well as Trump on Super Tuesday. Examples of the crony class include the law breaking bankers convicted of fraud with LIBOR, FOREX and mortgage fraud to the tune of trillions of dollars, and yet nobody EVER goes to jail. I love how the so-called conservatives sit and say nothing while their crony donors break law after law and only pay fines. It’s the same with the phony income inequality Democrats that see the fraud and say nothing. Bernie Sanders is resonating with young Democrats in part because he wants to clean up the banks that Hillary Clinton is getting millions of dollars from. This is the crony class I am talking about. You could not get more pathetic than the hit job failed candidate Mitt Romney gave to Trump this week. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is another example of crony capitalism. This helps Democrat and Republican cronies alike, and that’s why both parties pushed this through. When you hear Trump wanting to unwind trade deals like the TPP, he wants to do it because it helps “We the People.” This is what he means by “Making America Great Again.” The establishment, or crony class, is scared to death that not only the blood sucking will be will stopped, but these traitors and criminals will be held responsible.

The crony class is being aided and abetted by the mainstream media (MSM). Here’s the day after Super Tuesday and both candidates gave speeches. Clinton wants to “Make America Whole,” whatever that means. Trump wants to “Make America Great Again,” and vows to end the incompetent deal making and crime holding us all back. Trump said that “Hillary should not even be allowed to run. What she did was criminal. If she is allowed to run, it will be a sad day in America.” He was referring to her private, unprotected email server where she, no doubt, jeopardized national security. Did the shills at the MSM cover this important quote after a landslide win by both candidates? No, they did not! Now, it’s reported the Justice Department just gave immunity to the staffer that set up Hillary Clinton’s private email server. That means this is now officially a criminal investigation. Did the USA Today put this front page story on the front page? NO, it did not. The Washington Post sure did earlier this week. When I searched the USA Today website, it was nowhere to be found. It certainly was not on the front page and it IS front page news. This is how the old timey MSM lies by omission. It ain’t going to work. As I have said for many months, Clinton will be indicted.

Another way the MSM lies to distort the real picture is by what it reports about the economy. The latest comes from headlines created by crony Warren Buffet. If it were not for massive bail-outs, his investment company would have been decimated. Here’s one that says Buffett is “Bullish” on U.S. business. Here’s one that reads “Manufacturing’s Pain starts to Ease.”

This is total BS and spin just like the so-called “recovery” story they have been pushing down our throats. Week after week, I have no problem showing you how the real economy is doing in the headlines, and it’s not good. That’s not spin–it’s fact backed up by data.

On Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters that in his state alone, the epicenter of the viral outbreak in the United States, new coronavirus hospitalizations dropped by about 75 percent, from 1,427 four days ago to 358 on Sunday.

Highlighting the drop in new hospitalizations in NY, the state hardest hit (131,239 cases; 4,758 deaths as of Monday) by the coronavirus, Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter who has been following the U.S. outbreak closely, observed on Twitter on Monday: “It’s over, guys. It’s already over.”

Jim Malatras, an aide for Gov. Cuomo, reportedly indicated that projections are now showing that New York is unlikely to need 110,000 hospital beds, as previously thought.

The new forecasts show “a much lower demand” that stands in the estimated 20,000-30,000 range, Jesse McKinley, the New York Times bureau chief in the NY capital of Albany, wrote on Twitter on Monday.

That means the new projections for the number of hospital beds needed in NY are between about 70 and 80 percent lower than initially estimated.

On Monday, Gov. Cuomo acknowledged that the drop in hospitalizations in combination with other signs, like the fatalities remaining flat for the second day in a row and a drop in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, suggest a “possible flattening of the curve.”

Citing the figures contained in the White House-touted models created by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, the Epoch Times noted on Sunday:

While tens of thousands are hospitalized across the United States due to COVID-19, the numbers are a fraction of what experts predicted just a few days ago. The main reason appears to be that the [IHME] projections were already off the day they were released. (…)

Given that states with available data had a current hospitalization rate around 6 to 20 percent, if each of the no-data states had a rate of 20 percent, the hospitalizations for the whole country would add up to some 47,000 as of April 3 to 4.

The IHME model expected about 114,000 to 181,000 hospital beds would be needed nationwide on April 3, and roughly 120,000 to 430,000 on April 16.

That means the number of hospitalizations across the United States earlier this month was much less (at most about 40 percent of the forecasted figure) than the number predicted by the IHME model.

Amid the ongoing pandemic, health officials are relying on computer modeling that takes known data and makes predictions to inform and drive the decisions of private businesses and governments across the world.

Statistical models attempting to predict the impact of the Chinese coronavirus, including the ones created by IHME, rely, at least in part, on polluted data from the Chinese Communist Party, Breitbart News confirmed last Friday.

A growing number of experts – including Vice President Mike Pence and members of the Whitehouse Coronavirus Task Force that he leads – have questioned the legitimacy of China’s official coronavirus death toll and infection rate.

Anonymous members of the U.S. intelligence community allegedly agree that China has been hiding the severity of the viral outbreak within its borders, under-reporting both total cases and fatalities linked to the disease, Bloomberg reported this week.

The IHME predictions for New York also reflected a discrepancy between the institute’s forecasts and the actual number of hospitalizations.

IHME predicted that NY would need 41,000 to 58,000 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients by April 1.

Even by April 3, New York needed less than 16,000 hospital beds, the Epoch Times noted.

The IHME model only got its hospitalizations forecasts right for one state — Missouri, the news outlet found."

On April 6, Gaga said at a WHO media briefing that she helped raise the amount in seven days by calling on corporate leaders and philanthropists. The Business Insider reported that Lady Gaga said the funds will go toward global PPE supplies, testing kits, and help “improve lab capacity” to process the tests.

“We have said consistently that we are all in this together and we can only succeed together. We need an all-of-society approach with everyone playing their part. That includes people in the entertainment industry.”

Recently, Gaga partnered with the WHO and the music festival organization Global Citizen to spearhead a streamed musical festival called “One World Together at Home” that celebrated “the power of the human” that the pandemic has brought to light, said Business Insider.

According to Business Insider’s report, the concert, which featured dozens of stars, wasn’t a fundraiser, but rather it was intended to bring attention to all the positive occurring in the world now, too.

Gaga praised frontline healthcare workers, throughout her announcement. Business Insider quoted her saying:

“My heart is very, very, achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don’t infect their families or their patients,” Gaga said. “What you’re doing is putting yourselves in harm’s way to help the world, and we all salute you and you are a triumph, truly.”

As of May 8, there have been 4,343 deaths attributed to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) throughout the state of Michigan, along with reported 45,646 cases of infection. This means that for every 10 people who contract the novel virus, one of them will end up dying from it.

About a week prior, the reported death rate from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) was about nine percent, suggesting that fatalities may be on the rise.

The only other state that is anywhere close to Michigan in terms of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths is Connecticut, which is reporting about an eight percent mortality rate. All other states have a death rate below seven percent.

Most of these deaths in Michigan are centered in the eastern part of the state, and primarily around Detroit, it is important to note. In Western Michigan, as a contrast, the death rate from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently 3.6 percent.

The reason for this disparity is that some areas of Michigan have already reached their peak number of infections, while others, including areas around Detroit, are still seeing spikes in new cases.

Poverty-stricken areas and “more marginalized communities,” claim local news outlets, are being hit the hardest by spikes in new cases. Deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are also said to be higher in poorer communities compared to more affluent communities.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, gives his take on the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) death count and how it compares to other causes of death in the United States:

Citing this uncertain situation about the continued risk of more infections, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has announced that the state’s stay-at-home order will be extended another two weeks, terminating on May 28.

“This is good news for our state, our businesses, and our working families,” Whitmer announced at a press conference about the extension.

“We’re not out of the woods yet, but this is an important step forward on our MI Safe Start plan to re-engage our economy safely and responsibly,” she added. “As we continue to phase in sectors of our economy, I will keep working around the clock to ensure our businesses adopt best practices to protect workers from the spread of COVID-19. When we all keep doing our part, we can reduce the risk of a second wave and re-engage our economy safely and responsibly.”

Some manufacturing companies are being allowed to reopen now under the condition that they screen all of their employees daily as they enter these facilities. In addition to a symptom questionnaire, workers will need to get temperature checks with no-touch thermometers as soon as they can be obtained.

Companies that plan to reopen must also create dedicated entry points at their facilities, as well as suspend all entry of “non-essential” in-person visits by outside visitors.

Another part of the phase-in process being mandated by Whitmer for businesses is that they must train their workers on how the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) supposedly transfers from person to person, as well as how to identify potential symptoms in order to notify the company when they emerge.

“The vast majority of people in this state are doing the right things,” Whitmer claims. “We’ve seen the curve get pushed down.”

In what seemed to be a U-turn on the anti-Trump narrative, CNN anchor Dana Bash broke ranks by praising President Donald Trump on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, saying he is the “kind of leader that people need” in this time of crisis.

Bash braved backlash from guest American neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta saying Trump’s “tone” should be praised on an “American” and “human” level.

“If you look at the big picture, this was remarkable by the President of the United States,” Bash stated.

“This is a nonpartisan; this is an important thing to note and to applaud, from an American standpoint, from a human standpoint.”

“[Trump] is being the kind of leader that people need, at least in tone, today and yesterday, in tone, that people need and want and yearn for in times of crises and uncertainty,” she continued.

CNN's coverage of Trump has been largely negative, most notably from host Don Lemon, who unleashed a tirade during an interview with former Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich after he declined to criticize Trump’s coronavirus address earlier his month.

“We need straight, accurate information from this president,"" Lemon said.

""And this administration. And we’re not getting it,"" he yelled.

""And I don’t understand why you are tiptoeing around it!” Lemon said.

“He [Trump] came out. Gave an address that usually — that happens very rarely. And he doesn’t get it, right?”

Meanwhile, the left-leaning New York Times deceptively edited Trump's quote from his recent call with state governors, regarding medical ventilators.

The edited quote created the false impression that Trump was denying federal support for much-needed ventilators for hospitals treating coronavirus victims.

As of Tuesday, the coronavirus has infected 5,213 Americans, with a death toll of 85.

Across the globe, there are 200,000 confirmed cases and 7,800 deaths.

Former White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson praised Trump following his announcement of guidelines he and the coronavirus task force put together to slow the spread of the pandemic.

""The president has done everything he needed to do in this case.""

""He’s acted quickly and decisively. He did what he always has done ... he went with his instincts,"" he added.

HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson also backed the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic, urging people to work together to tackle the outbreak.

Carson urged people to keep their hands clean and obey government advice, or they are ""creating part of the problem.""

Trump is also pushing an $850 billion stimulus package, largely in the form of tax relief measures."

 Pope Francis is reportedly preparing a major world statement about extraterrestrial life and its theological implications. Rosana Ubanell from Voxxi News today reported that due to advances in scientific detection methods for the discovery of extraterrestrial life, Pope Francis wants to be ready with a statement about “First Contact”.

 

 Ubanell reports that details have yet to be officially announced but that the Vatican’s interest in extraterrestrial life is well documented through recent astrobiology conferences the Vatican Observatory has sponsored or participated in. Father Guy Consolmagno, a Jesuit astronomer and one of the leading Catholic proponents for preparing for the scientific discovery of extraterrestrial life, on July 18, won the Carl Sagan science medal from the American Astronomical Society. Pope Francis, a fellow Jesuit, regularly consults with Consolmagno and other leading Vatican astronomers about scientific issues. It is likely that Pope Francis is preparing an “Urbi et Orbi” speech – Latin for “to the city [of Rome] and the world” – about First Contact with extraterrestrial life.

The Vatican’s scientific interest in extraterrestrial life was publicly revealed for the first time in May 2008 when the head of the Vatican Observatory, Fr Gabriel Funes, also a Jesuit, gave an interview to the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano. Funes made a series of startling statements about how extraterrestrial life is likely to be more ethically evolved than humans, and can be welcomed as brothers. In his interview, which was titled “The extraterrestrial is my brother,” Funes said that intelligent extraterrestrial life may not have experienced a ‘fall’, and may be “free from Original Sin … [remaining] in full friendship with their creator.” This makes it possible to regard them as ‘our brothers’ as Funes explained:

Most importantly, Funes’ statement makes possible the idea that Christianity can be exported to extraterrestrial worlds that have not experienced a ‘fall’ and are free from original sin.

Just over a year after his interview, Funes was the organizer of the first ever Astrobiology Symposium held by Pontifical Academy of Sciences in November 2009. Consolmagno and Funes have ever since played leading roles for the Vatican Observatory in presenting a theological perspective on the discovery of extraterrestrial life. Most importantly, both have been leading advisors to Pope Francis about scientific issues concerning the discovery of extraterrestrial life.

What is likely to be the content of Pope Francis’ upcoming statement or possible “Urbi et Orbi” speech about alien life? An important clue is a forthcoming presentation by Fr. Consolmagno at a September 18-19, 2014, astrobiology symposium organized by NASA and the Library of Congress that is titled: “Preparing for Discovery: A Rational Approach to the Implications of Finding Microbial, Complex or Intelligent Life Beyond Earth.”

Consolmagno is a featured presenter and will discuss the theological implications of discovering alien life. His topic, “Would You Baptize an Extraterrestrial?” suggests that Pope Francis agrees that extraterrestrials are capable of the higher ethics involved in understanding the Christian message and becoming Christians.

If Pope Francis is indeed preparing a statement about extraterrestrial life, it is likely to emphasize that there is no incompatibility in Christian teachings with a belief in extraterrestrial life as Fr. Funes proposed in May 2008. More importantly, Pope Francis is likely to emphasize themes of extraterrestrials: not sharing in original sin; being more ethically evolved; and being capable of sharing the Christian message, and being our brothers.

Not all will welcome a statement from Pope Francis advocating extraterrestrials as brothers and worthy of being baptized into the Christian faith. According to Chris Putnam and Tom Horn, authors of Exovaticana, Pope Francis I is preparing to lead the Catholic Church to embrace aliens as “brothers in Christ” – reflective of the 1950s and 1960s contactee reports of benevolent “space brothers.” Putnam’s and Horn’s Exovaticana portends a future religious war between those accepting extraterrestrials as “brothers in Christ” and those believing them to be returning demons about to enslave us. Despite the extensive scholarship found in Exovaticana, it unfortunately skews data towards an overly negative assessment of the motivations of extraterrestrial visitors. Thankfully, the Vatican’s evolving public position, as reflected by statements from its leading astronomers, shows a far more enlightened stance on how to consider the discovery of alien life from a theological perspective. A statement or “Urbi et Orbi” speech from Pope Francis expounding on various themes associated with the view that extraterrestrials are potential “brothers in Christ’ is a welcome position to take on a controversial issue with major world significance.

(BigGovernment.news) For years the Obama administration–and especially the president himself–has been pushing the lie that humankind’s modern activities are “warming” the planet and “changing” the weather, all to the worse, of course, and if we don’t curb this activity soon, the entire planet will be lost.

It’s a dire scenario, to be sure, but it is a complete fabrication, from start to finish.

In the past, anyone with an open mind who has been willing to look at the issue of “global warming/climate change” has been shown plenty of evidence exposing this as nothing more than a hoax perpetuated against capitalism. To many of its adherents, it’s more of a cult-like religion (and you know how impossible it is to criticize someone’s religion), but to the creators of this massive hoax, it is nothing less than an attempt to de-legitimize the greatest economic model in the history of the planet–the one that is so successful even communist regimes like China have figured it out (hence that country’s multi-decade, double-digit economic growth).

But through the years, the global warming hoaxers have gone to great lengths to hide the fact that what they’re pushing is not true, not real, and not “dire.” That has included faking “warming” data, dramatically skewing claims that this is all “settled science,” changing the goalposts and the language in order to fit the “narrative,” destroying scientists who don’t “agree” with the narrative, and now, as President Obama has proven, fire top scientists in a bid to keep them quiet so the agenda can be advanced.

As reported by the Free Beacon:

A new congressional investigation has determined that the Obama administration fired a top scientist and intimidated staff at the Department of Energy in order to further its climate change agenda, according to a new report that alleges the administration ordered top officials to obstruct Congress in order to forward this agenda.

Rep. Lamar Smith (R., Texas), chair of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, released a wide-ranging reporton Tuesday that shows how senior Obama administration officials retaliated against a leading scientist and plotted ways to block a congressional inquiry surrounding key research into the impact of radiation.

A top DoE scientist who liaised with Congress on the matter was fired by the Obama administration for being too forthright with lawmakers, according to the report, which provides an in-depth look at the White House’s efforts to ensure senior staffers toe the administration’s line.

The report also provides evidence that the Obama administration worked to kill legislation in order to ensure that it could receive full funding for its own hotly contested climate change agenda.

The report additionally discovered efforts by the Obama administration to censor the information given to Congress, interfering with the body’s ability to perform critical oversight work.

Now, if your position on Man-caused global warming/climate change was so demonstrably correct and unassailable–which of course would be supported with solid, replicable research–why would you have to go to such lengths to “advance” your “global warming agenda?” In fact, why it is an “agenda” in the first place?

This is important because the Obama regime, along with most of the socialist governments of Europe, have modeled policies on the fake notion that Man’s modern life is killing the planet. Indeed, Obama’s global warming initiatives have cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions over the course of his tenure, while the combined weight of global warming policies worldwide have cost trillions. This translates into real lost wages, lost jobs, lost opportunities for hundreds of millions of people.

And it’s all premised on a lie.

The incoming Trump administration has signaled it is not going to be duped by the global warming hoaxers any longer, most visibly by the president-elect appointing someone to head the EPA–the agency Obama has used the most to advance his global warming nonsense–who has little use for the agency and it’s job-killing, nonsensical, politically motivated rule-making.

It’s about time this phony-baloney narrative went away for good. It’s creators and perpetrators have done more harm to people around the world than any factory or industry has done to the planet.

Hamid Gul tells CNN that neo-cons, zionists were behind terror attacks

General Hamid Gul, the former head of the Pakistani ISI, told CNN yesterday that both the Mumbai attacks and 9/11 were “inside jobs,” much to the chagrin of host and CFR luminary Fareed Zakaria, who told viewers that Gul’s opinions were “absolutely wrong and thoroughly discredited”.

“When you look at the full spectrum of possibilities, who could have done it, then one knows that Samjhauta Express was a similar case, in which Pakistan ISI was accused. But it turned out that it was the militant Hindus themselves who had killed 68 passengers in that train, and that it was an inside job,” said Gul.

“Now Colonel Srikant Purohit, who is a serving army officer, he has been caught in this particular case. And the whole thing has turned around.”

“So, obviously, there is an inside job.”

The revelation that Mukhtar Ahmed, a “counterinsurgency police officer who may have been on an undercover mission” working for Indian authorities was arrested for illegally buying mobile phone cards used by the Mumbai gunmen, allied with the numerous intelligence warnings proving that the method, arrival and targets of attack were all known well in advance, proves Gul right in his assertion that the terrorists could not have achieved such carnage without help from people on the inside.

Asked by Zakaria, “What is your hunch as to who did – who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks?,” Gul responded, “Well, I have been on record, and I said it is the Zionists or the neocons. They have done it. It was an inside job.”

“And they wanted to go on the world conquerors. They were looking upon it as an opportunity window, when the Muslim world was lying prostrate. Russia was nowhere in sight. China was still not an economic giant that is has turned out to be.”

“And they thought that this was a good time to go and fill those strategic areas, which are still lying without any American presence. And, of course, to control the energy tap of the world.”

“Presently, it is the Middle East, and in future it is going to be Central Asia,” added Gul.

Gul told Zakaria that the evidence for 9/11 being planned by Osama Bin Laden and executed by Al-Qaeda has not emerged and that the events are still “shrouded in mystery”.

“A lot of people have a lot of misgivings about that. And it’s not only me. I think a lot of people in America would be thinking the same way. There are scientists, there are scholars, who have written articles on it,” added Gul, calling for President elect Barack Obama to set up a new commission to investigate the attacks.

Gul said the attacks were planned inside America by people with a dangerous agenda who have “turned the world upside-down”.

Returning from a commercial break, Zakaria, editor of Newsweek, Council on Foreign Relations kingpin and also a Trilateral Commission board member, told his viewers, “Some of General Gul’s views are simply false. There is a mountain of evidence about 9/11 that refutes his assertions,” but Zakaria failed to cite any of it.

Zakaria was then joined by counter-insurgency expert David Kilcullen who said that the Mumbai attacks bore all the hallmarks of a “clandestine operation or a covert operation style activity,” but when pressed he refused to directly implicate Pakistan in the attack.

Geoengineering, which was long dubbed a “conspiracy theory” by the narrative gatekeepers, has suddenly become not just a thing, but the thing that will supposedly provide the solution to “climate change” and “global warming.” But is this really the true purpose of chemtrails?

Just as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, long warned, the geoengineering conspiracy would one day be exposed and make its way into the mainstream, but under false pretenses – and that’s exactly what appears to be happening.

Geoengineering is real, they’re now admitting, and it’s for the good of the planet. But the truth is that the chemtrail agenda is a nefarious tool that the “elite” are using as a means of weather control, and thus population control.

While it’s somewhat encouraging to see that what we and others have long warned about is, in fact, turning out to be everything we said it was, the revelation of this to the general public suggests that the globalists are much further along in fulfilling their agenda than many people probably think.

Climate scientists are absolutely mad, and their agenda will cause a planetary collapse

Even as the media admits that geoengineering is real, the claim is that it’s being used to “cool” the planet. All of that barium and aluminum raining down from our skies is somehow a “good” thing, the media insists, even as rates of chronic illness skyrocket.

With the financial help of globalist billionaires and eugenicists like Bill Gates, chemtrails are now being sprayed in pretty much every country around the world, which climate alarmists now say is necessary to “block” the sun from warming the earth.

It’s a ridiculous notion, and one that makes no logical sense in the same way that carbon dioxide (CO2) can’t be a “pollutant,” as the climate lobby claims, at the same time that it functions as a life molecule for sustaining all plant life. But this is what people like Neil deGrasse and Bill Nye claim is true, as does most of the mainstream media.

Bill Gates, it turns out, is actually funding a project known as ScoPEx, run by scientists from Harvard University, that involves intentionally releasing pollution to block out the sun.

As Adams warns, the result of this will be the impairing of photosynthesis in plants and phytoplankton which, combined with the climate lobby’s efforts to eliminate CO2, will mean the total collapse of the world’s food crops, leading to global famine, starvation, and mass death.

“That’s the real goal of the program, of course,” Adams writes.

“It’s a ‘mass extinction’ weapon system that’s funded by globalists to annihilate humankind by taking out the food webs that support human life. This is nothing less than the weaponization of the atmosphere to commit genocide on a planetary scale.”

This is one of the globalist deep state’s hard kill agendas, from which nobody will be able to escape. While soft kill programs like forced vaccination are able to catch most people and enslave them, hard kill sun-blocking will affect everyone, collapsing food systems, plant life, and eventually human existence.

“This planned pollution of the skies could devastate life on Earth,” Adams goes on to warn.

“It might unleash, ‘… things like mass famine, mass flooding, drought, of kinds that would affect very large populations,’ warns Stephen Gardiner, author of A Perfect Moral Storm, in a CNBC video that now touts the benefits of chemtrails.

It also implies that the White House and State Department were involved in shutting down the investigations, indicating secrecy and potential deception.","Recently released FBI documents prove the existence of highly sensitive National Security and criminal investigations of “Turkish Activities” in Chicago prior to September 11, 2001. These documents add further support to many of the allegations that former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds has claimed, in public and in Congress, since 2002. The documents were released under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request into an organization called the Turkish American Cultural Alliance (TACA), an organization repeatedly named by Ms. Edmonds as being complicit in the crimes that she became aware of when she was a translator at the FBI.

The documents released under FOIA are almost completely redacted, but they do support many of Edmonds’ claims, including:

There were a number of very serious FBI investigations into “Turkish activity in Chicago” involving a number of targets, including TACA These investigations were related to “National Security” among other things. These investigations were regarded as so sensitive that no files were to be uploaded to FBI’s computer system. The FBI repeatedly conducted actual “physical surveillance” against Turkish and American targets. Some of these investigations were shut down in 2001.

The earliest document is a November 1999 EC from the FBI’s National Security Division (NS-2D) to FBI field offices in Chicago, Washington DC, Los Angeles and New York (although there is a reference to a September 1999 EC from NSD.) The timing is significant. In an article in The American Conservative by Phil Giraldi, Ms. Edmonds notes that although there were investigations into Turkish activity dating back to 1996, most of that activity was being monitored by Counter-Intelligence based on FISA warrants because the main targets were foreigners, however in 1999 investigations were opened into ‘US Persons‘ and “they wiretapped the congressmen directly.”

The FBI was obviously concerned about ‘campaign donations’ being paid to Congressional Representatives by these groups. Ms. Edmonds has repeatedly referred to certain groups making “different kinds of campaign contributions — legal and illegal, declared and undeclared” to various congressional members. Two days after an EC from the National Security Division, Chicago reviewed the Federal Electoral Commission (FEC) database which contains details of donations to congressional campaigns. Chicago was apparently interested in donations made by “three individuals who attended the meeting at TACA.”

In 2008, Celebi briefly received some attention when he was key fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, and was nominated as one of Clinton’s Chicago delegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. He was eventually kicked out of the Clinton campaign because of the scrutiny.

At the time, Ms. Edmonds said:

Famed whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg once said that “Sibel says that suitcases of cash have been delivered to the Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, at his home, near Chicago, from Turkish sources, knowing that a lot of that is drug money.”

The aforementioned Vanity Fair article, apparently trying to dodge some potential legal liability, suggested that “the reported content of the Chicago wiretaps may well have been sheer bravado, and there is no evidence that any payment was ever made to Hastert.” However, a July 2001 EC regarding the “Statistical Accomplishments” of the TACA case notes that there were thirteen separate instances of actual ‘Physical Surveillance’ in the TACA case alone, suggesting that the FBI may very well have first-hand evidence of some of these crimes.

One fascinating feature of many of these documents is that many of them ominously warn about the sensitivity of the investigation. A typical warning reads:

Ms. Edmonds has often stated that these investigations into illegal Turkish activity were shut down by the White House and State Department in 2001 and 2002, but that the FBI Chicago Office fought to keep them open. Two of the ten cases related to TACA were officially closed by Chicago in July 2001, however even the documents relating to these ‘closed’ cases still warned that the information required ‘extreme caution’ and were not to be uploaded or shared with CID.

Asked to comment on these new documents, Ms. Edmonds replied:

“Finally! I’ve been saying this for years, and now we finally have documented proof from the FBI of this Turkish criminal activity based in Chicago. This is fantastic, but even this is only the tip of the iceberg. The main question is this: Why has the White House and the State Dept been so determined to shut these investigations down? They shut down these investigations at the FBI, they shut me down with the State Secrets Privilege. What are they hiding? Chicago was the center of it all, Chicago was the center of the foreign espionage activity, and the center for money laundering, and also a major heroin distribution center. Celebi was a key player, but Dennis Hastert, Mayor Daley, Robert Creamer and other US officials also helped facilitate these activities. When will we see some accountability?“

That is the ultimate question. We now have even more evidence of these crimes — but there is still no sign of any accountability. What will it take?

 Comment Mercury in vaccines has for long been an excellent tool for the Elite to poison the population, and is part of their bigger plan to create a . Apparently, the Illuminati are not ready yet to remove this dangerous poison from the vaccines, and Bush is just following orders from above. As we know, he has no say or power on his own. However, he has been one of the best tools (read fools) for the Illuminati ever created. He has done a good job so far in the eyes of the Elite. Bravo, Georgie Boy! Way to go! afeMinds and autism community call the White House declaration 'irresponsible and dangerous' 

 

 

 WASHINGTON, July 18/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- According to the Congressional Quarterly, the White House stated on Tuesday that President Bush would veto the HHS-Labor-Education Appropriations Bill because of the cost and ""objectionable provisions"" such as a measure to ban the use of childhood flu vaccines that contain thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative. 

 

 Autism advocacy groups are outraged because President Bush stated in a questionnaire during his 2004 campaign: ""I support the removal of Thimerosal from vaccines on the childhood national vaccine schedule. During a second term as President, I will continue to support increased funding to support a wide variety of research initiatives aimed at seeking definitive causes and/or triggers of autism. It is important to note that while there are many possible theories about causes or triggers of autism, no one material has been definitely included or excluded."" 

 

 But since 2005, President Bush has steadfastly refused to issue an Executive Order banning high amounts of mercury in vaccines that would protect children and pregnant women despite repeated requests from the autism community that he uphold his campaign promise. Under his current administration, mercury has been and will continue to be knowingly injected into the youngest of American citizens. The controversial mercury-containing preservative thimerosal has been linked by thousands of parents as being the cause of their children's mercury poisoning and autism. 

 

 The flu vaccine which continues to be manufactured with mercury is recommended for all pregnant women, infants and children despite the fact that the Institute of Medicine in 2001 recommended against the policy of exposing these same sensitive groups to thimerosal containing vaccines. According to the EPA, one in every six women of childbearing age already has blood levels of mercury high enough to cause neurological damage to their unborn children due to environmental exposures alone. ""Injecting even more mercury into the bodies of pregnant women, infants and children when it is not a necessary component of vaccines is just bad medicine,"" said Lyn Redwood, president of SafeMinds and parent of a mercury-injured child. ""It defies logic that a flu vaccine must be disposed of as a hazardous waste if it is not used, but somehow injecting the same mercury-containing vaccine into a baby is safe.""

Roseanne Barr was fired from her show, and it was cancelled all because of what ABC called a “racist” tweet involving former Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett. I don’t think Barr was fired for this tweet, but she was fired because she was waking up the masses to what the Deep State and George Soros were doing to America. According to Barr, Soros is trying to initiate an “overthrow of US Constitutional Republic.” The ideas she was putting out on her show were so dangerous to the Deep State they were willing to flush $60 million in revenue a year by cancelling the hit TV show.

Holter contends, “The system has gotten too big. The system has gotten bigger than the creators of the system, if you will. It is bigger than the sovereign governments collectively. It’s bigger than the central banks collectively. There’s too much debt. Too many sovereign governments have bumped up against debt saturation. In the U.S., we are over 100% debt to GDP. We are way over 100% debt to GDP if you include all debt. If you include all the off-book guarantees, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and all the other promises, we have blown up as far as debt to GDP ratios. So, the ability to prevent a crash no longer exists.”

For the people who think central banks can print money to infinity, Holter advises, “People have the belief in central banks because, to this point, it has worked. So, they extrapolate that it will always work. What they are not factoring in is many sovereign governments have reached debt saturation. In other words, many governments have gotten to the point of Greece or Puerto Rico. It can’t take more debt. The problem in Europe is the individual countries can’t print money. The U.S. can print money. The question is will foreigners accept what we print forever? The answer is no.”

Holter says the Fed will print more money. It will be forced to and it will not work the same as other money printing. Holter explains, “The next one, in my opinion, is going to be ‘QE Forced.’ It’s going to be forced on the Fed.”

The recent announcement the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will put off allowing the Chinese yuan to become part of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket of currencies is a bad omen for the U.S. dollar. Holter thinks, “China being pushed off by the IMF until at least 2016 is a slap in China’s face. They publicly and officially requested to become part of the SDR. . . . The IMF, steered by the U.S., basically slapped them in the face. You’ve got to look at this as a financial war. This is a shot by the U.S. saying, no, we are not letting you in the club. It is inevitable that the Chinese currency will become part of the SDR or a reserve currency or ‘the’ reserve currency. It’s inevitable. The U.S. is trying to buy an extra year’s time, and it can’t.”

What can China do to retaliate? Holter says, “I think they have two potential moves. . . . The right time may be in a month or two during weakness in our markets. Remember, this was done by the IMF during very serious weakness in their markets. We kind of punched them on the way down. They have two real answers. They can tell the truth about how much gold they have. They can come out and say they have 10,000 tons or 15,000 or 20,000 tons or whatever it happens to be. The second is China has an awful lot of Treasuries. This is where I think they can force the Fed into monetizing their debt. They would be creating their own exit door. . . . Then, the Fed would have a big choice. Would the Fed buy them? There is your QE forced. Or, do they just let the interest rates go up and the bond market tank? It’s either option A or option B.”

Holter says, in the last year, there have been many big warnings from the Bank of International Settlements and the IMF about a coming financial calamity. Holter says, “I think they are trying to get out in front of this. I think they are telling the truth–the world is defenseless. The central banks, the sovereign Treasuries have fired all their bullets already, and they realize when this next crash comes, there’s nothing that can be done.”

Sure, it’s only a patent right now but with how advanced Tesla is overall it could end up reality in a lot less time than you’d expect.

According to Electrek, the company has developed a laser system for cleaning debris off of glass panels which would easily be what you would refer to your windshield as. These laser wipers might be something they put to commercial use the fact that there is a patent for it overall is quite mind-blowing. This patent was filed earlier this year but it seems not many have noticed until recently.

As follows was written in regards to the patent on patents.justia.com:

A cleaning system for a vehicle includes a beam optics assembly that emits a laser beam to irradiate a region on a glass article of the vehicle, debris detection circuitry that detects debris accumulated over the region, and control circuitry. The control circuitry calibrates a set of parameters associated with the laser beam emitted from the beam optics assembly based on detection of the debris accumulated over the region on the glass article, controls an exposure level of the laser beam on the debris accumulated based on calibration of the set of parameters associated with the laser beam, wherein the exposure level is controlled based on pulsing the laser beam at a calibrated rate that limits penetration of the laser beam to a depth that is less than a thickness of the glass article and removes the debris accumulated over the region on the glass article using the laser beam.

You can click here to read more about the patent itself.

This whole invention overall is being credited to Phiroze Dalal a Staff Scientific and Industrial Imaging Specialist at Tesla according to Electrek. Basically, this system overall while not designed for rain would be able to automatically remove any debris that could be obstructing the driver’s view. For instance, if you come outside to notice a bunch of leaves somehow on your windshield, the lasers would remove them for you.

Sure, we’ve always had windshield wipers (at least for as long as I’ve been around) but this takes things to a whole new level whether it becomes mass-produced/common or not. Tesla is already quite ahead of most car companies and so this really shows you how far apart they intend to place themselves from the rest. As you can see in the diagrams below, this is actually something that could be very functional, scary but functional.

What do you think about all of this? Would you want laser wipers on your car? I for one think they would be pretty badass. In the future, I can only imagine just how truly insane vehicles will look and just how mind-blowing their features will be."

Make no mistake, this is a deliberate attempt to force vaccines and normalize quarantine procedures across nations during outbreaks. And to prove that, check out the GHSA Immunization agenda for participating countries:
• At least 90% coverage of the country’s 15-month-old population with at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine.

And thanks to Bill Gates, the CDC will have an easier time keeping track of people with a surveillance tool that helps identify “district-level measles risk” based on immunization records. But, just in case that isn’t enough invasion of privacy, HHS (Health and Human Services) recently proposed giving the CDC the power to detain and quarantine people without due Process. Now, I know the first time we wrote about this many of you didn’t think this was a big deal because, in times of epidemic, the state already has that right- this is how quarantine works, etc. However, that’s not really the issue. The issue is that the CDC gets to define everything. So, even if you haven’t been exposed to anything- they can say you have been and start the process; be it vaccination, quarantine, etc- and you have NO DUE PROCESS:

“CDC may enter into an agreement with an individual, upon such terms as the CDC considers to be reasonably necessary, indicating that the individual consents to any of the public health measures authorized under this part, including quarantine, isolation, conditional release, medical examination, hospitalization, vaccination, and treatment: provided that the individual’s consent shall not be considered as a prerequisite to any exercise of any authority under this part.

And, if you violate the terms of the agreement or the terms of the Federal order for quarantine, isolation, or conditional release (even if no agreement exists between you and the government), you may be subject to criminal penalties. Because:

Again, I would ask that you read the plan for yourself so you can familiarize yourself with what Obama signed us up for. We must educate ourselves so we know how to protect ourselves and our families.

Threaten to burn down the facility.

Migrants housed at a refugee camp in Germany began rioting, displayed the ISIS flag and subsequently tried to escape after they were put under a coronavirus quarantine.

After a migrant tested positive for coronavirus at the facility in Suhl, Thuringia, a quarantine was ordered for the other 533 residents and the camp was sealed off.

“But the measure, which in times of Corona seems not at all unusual, apparently drove the asylum seekers to a fury,” reports Compact Online. “Some of them started rioting and prevented inmates from entering the dining hall in order to force a hunger strike. They are said to have tried to leave the facility through the sewers to get to the nearby town.”

According to police spokesman Wolfgang Nicola, the migrants then gathered at the front gate and began threatening to burn down the facility while displaying ISIS flags.

Why they even have possession of ISIS flags in the first place is shocking.

50 police officers were dispatched to the scene to quell the riots. The same migrant camp was also the scene of riots back in 2015 in response to a man tearing pages out of the Koran.

“The danger that Corona will also break out in other shelters is omnipresent, a further restriction of public life is to be expected,” states the report. “It is hard to imagine that the capacities of the security forces and medical staff are sufficient to keep at bay angry illegal immigrants who do not want to comply with the protective measures against the spread of COVID-19.”

“If the Wuhan virus leads to major social unrest in Germany, the country’s multitudinous “refugees” are likely to play a major role,” warns Dave Blount.

As we highlighted yesterday, migrants in Naples, Italy are completely ignoring the quarantine order to stay indoors and are roaming around the streets.

First up, the embattled President Trump. Celente says, “There’s not been one shred of evidence, period, paragraph, that Russia had anything to do with tapping into or hacking the DNC information and going into their computers. It has nothing to do with Trump, but what it does is it’s taking the people’s minds off the major issues. It’s also building that military industrial complex even bigger. We’ve got to watch out for those Russians. Russia’s GDP is about 7% of America’s. Trump has increased our military budget $54 billion. The entire Russian military budget is $48 billion. You talk to the average person, and they hate the Russians. It’s working perfectly . . . We don’t see Trump being impeached.”

On the Clintons, Celente contends, “Going back to the Uranium One deal. Yes, it is going to fall back on the Clintons. The hundreds of millions of dollars given to the Clinton Foundation by Russians as they did the uranium deal. Those are facts. We don’t see anything happening to Trump.

On the economy, Celente says, “We are now going into almost a year going into the Trump rally. I was negative on the stock market until Trump got elected. What happened? We did a 180 (degree turn) a week after he got elected and said this rally is real. . . . Trump is pro-business . . . it’s good for the markets and that sector.”

But what about the 2018 economic forecast? Celente says, “For the economy, we see a slowdown. Interest rates are going up. That’s the bet. Interest rates are going to go up another 25 basis points in December. So, we believe by the 2nd quarter of 2018, you are going to start to see a slowdown because the only thing that has pumped up the markets is the cheap money. . . .The fish rots from the head down, the markets are going to melt from the head down. The head being the very rich. The top 10% of the rich own 96% of the stock. . . . So, this thing rots down, and we are seeing it now on research. It’s going to fall from the top.”

Celente also predicts China will make big headlines in 2018. Celente points out, “China is not using petro-dollars. They are buying Russian oil, their biggest supplier, with yuan. You can cash in the yuan for gold. It’s the same with Iran and with Saudi Arabia. This is another reason that China is going to go further. You can start bringing your dollars to Walmart in a wheelbarrow because that’s what they will be worth. . . . What kept the dollar alive as the world reserve currency is that all the oil being traded is being bought in dollars. If you are paying for oil in other currencies . . . the Federal Reserve can’t keep printing up all the money that they want. They won’t have it out there as a reserve currency. You will see inflation skyrocket in this country, and gold will hit like a Bitcoin high. We believe it’s starting to happen.

Join Greg Hunter as he interviews the Publisher of the Trends Journal, Gerald Celente, and hear about multiple other trends and predictions for 2018.

Gerald Celente also says the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) will be renegotiated by President Trump, and he does not need Congressional approval. Celente predicts, “The renegotiation of NAFTA will be a big positive for Republicans and a big selling point for them in the 2018 Mid-term Elections. Right now, NAFTA only helps multinational companies. When it’s renegotiated, it will help American citizens.

269,True,"The article suggests that parents were kept in the dark about their right to opt out of vaccines, children were herded into a courthouse to be injected, and authorities kept a close watch on advocacy groups and reporters who tried to inform parents.

Parents were threatened with fines and jail time last week if they failed to have their children immunized, after schools kicked out kids for not taking the Hepatitis B vaccine.

According to observers who were able to gain access to the courthouse, children with a history of medical issues were not properly screened as parents were simply told to get in line and have their kids take the shots.

""Many of those in line said their children were properly immunized, but the school system had misplaced the records. They said efforts to get the paperwork straightened out beforehand had been futile,"" reported the Associated Press.

In the following video, Kelli Ann Davis, a member of SafeMinds, a national autism advocacy organization, whose son Miles was diagnosed with autism in 2002 as a result of mercury poisoning from vaccines, relates how she was also followed by police with dogs to the bathroom after being told she ""was not one of them"".

She also explains how the information packs handed out to parents before they lined up to have their kids take the shots failed to include waiver forms giving parents the right to opt out due to personal, religious or medical reasons.

State Attorney Glenn Ivey, who admitted during a radio interview last week that no law mandated the shots and also that he had chosen not to give his kids the vaccines, confirmed that exemption forms were available from the back of the room. However, when asked if they were aware of the right to opt out, parents were miffed. News reports failed to cite any cases where parents had opted out as a result of signing waiver forms.

According to an Associated Press report, over a thousand children were vaccinated on Saturday, leaving around 1100 who did not show up to the courthouse. The fact that mandatory shots were being doled out in court after parents had been threatened with arrest, reminiscent of some nightmarish science fiction horror movie, and potentially dangerous in itself, was also overlooked by mainstream news coverage.

On Friday, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons condemned the case as a ""vaccine roundup.""

""This power play obliterates informed consent and parental rights,"" said Kathryn Serkes, director of policy for the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), one of the few national physician groups that refuse corporate funding from pharmaceutical companies. In a scenario reminiscent of cattle round-ups, the state's attorney has issued summons to more than 1600 parents of children who have not provided certificates of immunization for their children. But instead of toting a cattle prod, this state's attorney chooses to wield a syringe to keep the ""herd"" in line. Children should be carefully screened, medical records taken and decisions made carefully - not in an ad hoc assembly-line clinic in a county courtroom and under the brutal watch of law enforcement. This is a man-made disaster ready and waiting to detonate. Children could receive a dangerous cocktail of several vaccines without proper examinations. ""The procedure is reckless and subjects children to the risk of severe reactions. Physicians would not be allowed to treat children in this way, without individual histories and physical exams - or informed consent,"" said Jane M. Orient, M.D., AAPS Executive Director.

AAPS also pointed out a blatant conflict of interest, highlighting the fact that the school district is set to lose a windfall in state funding unless students comply with the vaccine order.

With the state still hell-bent of getting over a thousand other children to take the shots, this case is far from over, and charges that parents have been subject to an intimidation campaign while not being properly informed of the exemption process will continue."

Have you noticed that everyone around you is congested and coughing? I am calling this new syndrome “chemtrail cough.” My wife is coughing, I am coughing and now even our dogs are coughing. In just four years death by respiratory disease has skyrocketed from 8th in the world to 3rd and possibly even 2nd.

If someone in congress receives a letter with a little bit of white powder in it the capitol is evacuated and the media freaks out and starts screaming “terrorists.” However right over their heads hundreds of tons of nano aluminum and barium are being sprayed on them daily and yet nobody seems to care.

Yesterday I heard Alex Jones start his broadcast by saying his throat hurt and his voice was messed up because of something in the air but he didn’t know what it was.

Just one hour before his show started I heard the world’s leading expert on the subject of chemtrails and geoengineering (Dane Wiginton) conduct an interview and he sounded terrible too.

Alex often talks about what people will put up with. One of his ideas is to go door to door in Austin and ask homeowners if it would be ok to put cameras in their bedrooms and then record their responses. Of course no sane person would allow that yet they do allow the nsa and countless other agencies and private corporations to do exactly the same thing via their smart tv’s and smart phones.

Here’s my idea. How would anyone from Infowars or any other patriot radio show like it if I cornered your kid somewhere, opened a can of bug spray and emptied the entire can on their face? You probably wouldn’t like it too much and yet you tolerate the EXACT same thing to be done to your kids on a daily basis by bill gates and the rest of the geo-engineering fanatics.

How is this not the number one story in the world all day and every day? Has everyone in the alternative media lost their minds too? We know that nano sized particulate of aluminum is very harmful to the brain and is responsible for killing everything that lives and yet it is rarely discussed and very little effort is directed to exposing it and stopping it. Don’t people understand that if we don’t stop this right now there will be nothing left to live and fight for?

They are turning the sky over the entire country white daily. I have saved these recent satellite images to illustrate just how much material they are dumping on us. The sprayers repeat the same pattern day after day with very few exceptions.

They typically spray heavily first thing in the morning and greet the sun as it rises. The spraying continues all day following the sun as it crosses the sky. In late afternoon they spray heavily in the west as the sun sets. The aluminum and barium (blanketing us all day) dissipates and falls to the ground in the early evening. The planes then return to their bases to refuel, rearm and get ready for the next attack the following morning.

Unless all radio talk show hosts come together and put an end to this craziness called geo-engineering it is my opinion that all life on earth will die and the battle for the future of humanity will be lost.

Dane Wigington should be on every radio show at least once a week to cover the latest developments in the collapse of our ecosystem. It’s accelerating and nothing is being done to curtail these insane programs.

I never thought I would have to say this to my own people: Wake The Hell Up!!

Bloomberg was targeted for attack by the other candidates on the stage and he hesitated under the barrage.

Michael Bloomberg faced a barrage of attacks at his first Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday, as his rivals assailed the free-spending and fast-rising billionaire over his record on race, history of sexist comments and the use of his massive fortune to muscle his way into the contest.

In a rough debate debut that gave voters their first unscripted look at the media mogul and self-funding former New York mayor, Bloomberg seemed uncomfortable and hesitant as he defended his record and argued that he is Democrats’ best chance of beating Republican President Donald Trump in November.

Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg all lined up to go after Bloomberg, who has surged in polls helped by an unprecedented advertising blitz. But they also heaped personal attacks on one another in the most contentious of the nine Democratic White House debates.

All of the contenders on the Las Vegas debate stage accused Bloomberg of trying to buy his way into the White House and said his record as mayor and businessman was not good enough to beat Trump."

Wesley Clark, Jamie Shea, NATO, Slobodan Milosovic, and the U.S. Defense Department as actors responsible for statements and actions.",True,"The article discusses the bombing of Kosovar civilians, mistaken NATO attacks on civilians, and the broadcast of an interview with an American pilot.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article discusses the use of propaganda and manipulation of public opinion.,True,The article mentions the fidelity of NATO spokespeople to military secrecy.,"NEW YORK - Truth, as the old saying goes, is the first casualty of war. It is also the lifeblood of democracy. An untruth, even in time of war, is a far more dangerous fatality in a democracy than in a dictatorship. Democracy is fueled by openness and candor; dictatorships are founded on lies. Truth is always a casualty in totalitarian states; it ought never be a casualty in a democracy, even in time of war. Especially in time of war. * When Gen. Wesley Clark declared last week that the bombing of Kosovar civilians on a road north of the town of Djakovica was the work of Serbians who were trying to blame it on NATO, it was a statement unworthy of a democratic alliance. It was a statement very nearly the equivalent of the Orwellian untruths of Slobodan Milosovic. * When Jamie Shea, NATO,s glib spokesman, admitted that one of the several mistaken NATO attacks on civilians is 'the one we own up to' and that the deaths were the result of 'collateral damage,' it was a statement unworthy of a democracy. * When NATO broadcast an interview with an American pilot and allowed journalists to assume that he was the pilot that mistakenly bombed the convoy, it was a deception that was almost the equal of Milosovic's reign of lies. NATO and the U.S. Defense Department have subsequently tried to rectify their errors, but the stories offered a frightening insight into the accuracy of the news we are getting. We have seen plenty of stories about the fact that Serbians are the victims of 'black propaganda,' that they are not told of the atrocities that their leaders are committing in their name, that they do not know what is going on in their own nation. While undoubtedly true, those stories are part of our own peculiar propaganda, propaganda that is designed to generate support for the war and animosity for the Serbs. The NATO press operation seems to have a different level of candor than Americans are used to. The fidelity of the NATO spokespeople is to military secrecy, not democratic openness. The origin of propaganda in this century began with World War I, when British and American posters depicting atrocities by the bloodthirsty 'Hun' were designed to sway mass opinion against Germany. They did so. Such public relations are necessary in a democracy. For in a democracy, leaders rule - or make war - with the consent of the governed. They must implicitly obtain our consent before sending our boys into battle. Consent, these days, is measured by opinion polls. For the government to obtain a favorable poll number, we must be persuaded that the government is doing what is right, just, and the American way. That is why our opponents are always demonized and made into the moral equivalents of the worst fiend we know, Adolf Hitler. That is how American public opinion is mobilized. Saddam Hussein was virtually the anti-Christ himself. Now Slobodan Milosovic is the new great Satan. If our opponents are always evil, then we must always be on the side of the angels. A democracy should never fight lies with lies. The other side of the propaganda equation is the sanctification of the refugees. They are pictured on television and in magazine in soft-focus images, with the camera dwelling on the most comely young women, the saddest old men, and the most fetching children. These pictures have mobilized public opinion in favor of military action and they even persuaded that great humanitarian Michael Jackson into writing a song for the refugees because, as he said, he could not watch them on television without crying. I don't mean to suggest that Milosovic is a good guy. Or that he isn't responsible for a great calamity, or that he is not what many insist on calling a war criminal. Or that the refugees are anything other than innocent victims. I don't wish to suggest there is a moral equivalency between the Serbs and ourselves. But a democracy has higher standards. President Clinton says we are fighting for democracy in Kosovo. We must show our antagonists how democracy works. We must live up to the standards we are seeking to impose. Democracy means openness. A totalitarian leader uses any means to persuade, any means to retain power. In order for us to function as a democracy, we must make informed decisions. And that information must be truthful, otherwise our consent is being obtained by chicanery. There's nothing democratic about that. Spinning a war should be a war crime. The NATO press operation seems to have a different level of candor than Americans are used to. The fidelity of the NATO spokespeople is to military secrecy, not democratic openness. That is unfortunate. I saw Christiane Amanpour the other night on CNN saying that everyone was 'spinning' this story. Spinning is just a euphemism for lying, a euphemism that tries to make the lying seem not as egregious. Spinning a war should be a war crime. One of the reasons Americans turned against the war in Vietnam was because they realized they had been lied to about it from the very beginning. Perhaps if the government had been more honest, public opinion would have been different. A democracy should never fight lies with lies.

I said 9 or 10 months ago, it hadn’t happened yet, but it should happen because of the instability of a system that is supported by central bank maneuvers and not really anything organic and leveraging and reaching for yields in places like oil and natural gas and other places on the virtue of cheap money. . . . It kind of boggles the mind. This QE is epic. It’s historic. It is larger and more insane that ever in history. It is pan-global. The reason that things have kind of stayed in place is because there was enough cheap money coming into the system and enough corporations getting it . . . that really kept the markets artificially buoyed by virtue of this cheap money coming in. That’s kind of coming to a stop. The ECB QE will help provide the markets and banks some solvency for a while and some buoy for a while. So, therefore, there is still a little bit coming in.”

Prins goes on to predict, “The volatility is going to increase. Last year, we had volatility spikes in August, October and December. This year, we’ve already had a spike in January. So, the shocks are coming in more closely and the downsides are deeper. That’s why we are transitioning down. At the end of this year, we will have a lower market. It will start to come apart, and these shocks will have a more intense volatility and chaotic impact over this year. That will basically start to unravel all of this money that’s been dumped and the way in which this money has held up a system that should not be held up. It has no inherent value.”

On the U.S dollar getting suddenly crushed, Prins, who is a former high ranking Goldman Sachs banker, says, “It will be weakened finally because of the fact of all these QE combinations are somewhat playing themselves out. There is nowhere else to go. However, the reason it stayed up and the reason it will continue to stay up for a little bit longer than most folks are saying. Again, it’s not because policy is good, not because so much debt on the books of the country is good, not because our GDP ratio relative to debt is good. All those things are horrific. Using cheap money to leverage a system is horrible. Using money to fix a banking system that doesn’t work is not a good policy. It hasn’t trickled down to the average person . . . but what the dollar has going for it is the collaboration of the government, the private banks and the Fed is the fact they had a first mover advantage. The QE, the dump, the policies were bad, but they were first. So, what’s happened is the dollar is not propped up by good economics. It’s propped up artificially by all of these maneuvers, but everything else is doing so badly and will continue to do badly that (the dollar) it will have a relatively better value for now. . . . I think the dollar will get weaker, but I don’t think we are going to see that plunge in the very near term because every other country is struggling right now. That’s why there is still an advantage to the dollar and, again, not because our policies dictate that and not because this extra debt is smart.”

On gold, Prins contends, “This shift to the dollar going down, I think, will be more gradual. For the same reason the dollar stays strong is the same reason gold has done okay very recently but hasn’t had this major outbreak. . . . Gold will increase this year–also gradually for the same reason the dollar will not dump but could decrease gradually as QE and all these maneuvers play out. I don’t really think this is going to be that breakout year. The markets are going to go down because of the end of all this artificial aid, but we also have been underestimating the aid that gets continually dumped into the markets and into these banks. That’s where the timing is critical to look at. . . . There’s going to be a negative market. There’s going to be a downward impact on the markets. There’s going to be an upward impact on gold. All of that will happen. It’s just not going to be as huge this year. It’s going to be a more gradual working into that this year.”

277,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions Saddam Hussein's regime, members of the international community, and Baath party figureheads as actors.",True,"The article mentions the use of banned chemical and napalm bombs, the supply of materials and technological know-how for chemical weapons, and the joining of Baath party figureheads with ISIS as actions.",True,"The article mentions the high death toll, injuries, complications, diseases, birth defects, and suffering of Iranian soldiers as threats.",False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy.,"March 16 marks the anniversary of the Halabja massacre, perpetrated by Saddam Hussein’s regime in 1988. Otherwise known as Bloody Friday, the massacre occurred during the closing year of the Iran-Iraq war, and was meant to stop the Iranian counter-offensive that was making progress.

The massacre was actually the result of the use of banned chemical and napalm bombs on the town of Halabja, which result in a very high death toll of 5000, not to mention 10,000 injured, most of whom were civilians, and thousands later dying from complications, diseases, and birth defects in the years after the massacre.

The Halabja massacre was itself part of the Al-Anfal genocide that Saddam’s forces perpetrated against Iraq’s Kurdish population. This use of weapons of mass destruction wasn’t an isolated incident for Iraq, nor did it occur without the knowledge of members of the international community, rather many countries helped supply the materials and the technological know-how for chemical weapons, including Singapore, the UAE, India, West Germany, Egypt, the U.S, and two French companies. Furthermore, some declassified documents also show that the US, who accused Iran of perpetrating the chemical attacks, were fully aware that Saddam’s regime was the one responsible.

Overall, during the Iran-Iraq war, there exist 14 documented cases of the Iraqis resorting to chemical weapons against the Iranian army, with each instance killing no less than 1000 troops. Some Iranian soldiers who lived through these attacks are still suffering from the consequences to this very day.

Now, more than a decade after the fall of Saddam’s regime, the figureheads of his Baath party have joined hands with ISIS. Not only did they join the ranks of ISIS, but Baathists were in fact instrumental in the survival of the group. Of ISIS’s 23 portfolios, which are equivalent to ministries in the lands they have control over, Saddam’s regime’s former officers run three of the most crucial portfolios: Security, military, and finance.

Many call the union between ISIS and Baath a “marriage of convenience”. Although they were absorbed into ISIS, Saddam’s officers provided most of the brainpower behind ISIS. Although the Baath was a secular nationalist party, the Baathists who were left unemployed and denied of their pensions under the Debaathification law of 2003 were disgruntled. Many would later join ISIS because it pays well, and they feel at home with its extremist message, while others share nothing more with it than its hate for the post-Saddam Iraqi state."

There has been some good news about profits at Ford, Chrysler and General Motors in recent weeks, and GM plans on spending $2 billion to update plants and hire more than 4,000 workers. I am happy the Big 3 car companies are doing well even though two of them went through bankruptcy. I am also thrilled that GM is hiring, but the car company still employs only about half (49,000) of the hourly workers it had in 2006.

An example, of what I am talking about is contained in the headline of yesterday’s USA Today newspaper. It read “Middle-class and hungry in post-recession USA.” The story goes on to say, “Cutting back became a necessity for many American families during and after the recession. But what the Cruz family and a growing number of other once-thriving middle-class families didn’t expect was to find themselves qualifying for — and needing — the support of federally funded food assistance programs.” (Click here to read the complete USA Today story.) How can the recession be over when record numbers of Americans are on food stamps and are seeking help from the government to survive? CNN reported last month, “One in six Americans is receiving help from the government, just as fiscal austerity threatens to reduce some of that aid. Soaring unemployment during The Great Recession has driven tens of millions of people to the dole. Enrollment in Medicaid and food stamp programs are at record highs, while unemployment insurance rolls remain at elevated levels. Many people depend on more than one program.” (Click here for the complete CNN story.)

The absurd idea that the recession we are still experiencing is over comes from the National Bureau of Economic Research. Here’s how the Wall Street Journal reported the announcement last September: “. . . the committee determined only that the recession ended and a recovery began in that month,” the committee said in a statement. The 2007-2009 recession is the longest in the post-WWII period. . . . The decision by the NBER means that any future downturn in the economy would be considered a new recession and not a continuation of the recession that began in 2007.” (Click here to read the original WSJ story.)

It is preposterous to call what is going on in America today a “recovery” or “post-recession.” Congressman Ron Paul recently said there were “33 million” Americans unemployed. A record of more than one million foreclosures happened last year, with another record expected to be set again in 2011. The abandonment of mark to market accounting that happened in 2009 to make the banks look solvent (when indeed they are not) is still in place. 157 banks were closed down by the FDIC in 2010, and 40 have been shut down so far this year. These banks weren’t closed because they had too much money and people were making their debt payments on time. Just this week, Reuters reported, “U.S. home values fell in the first quarter at the fastest rate since late 2008, real estate data firm Zillow Inc. said on Monday, suggesting that a bottom will not be seen until 2012 at the earliest. . . . The number of homeowners under water — or, those who owe more on the mortgage than their house is currently worth — amounted to 28.4 percent of single-family homeowners, representing a peak since Zillow began calculating the data in 2009.” (Click here for the complete Reuters report.) Nearly 1 in 3 homeowners is “under water” with no bottom in real estate until “2012 at the earliest.” I really don’t see how the NBER declared the recession over in 2009! Is this really what a “recovery” is supposed to look like? I don’t think so.

A few glimmers of hope in the economy do not make for a real sustained recovery. Much of the constant cheerleading by the mainstream media is more like public relations than real reporting."

One is about “America First,” and the other is for a new world order control system of people globally. One is a good guy and man of the people, and the other is an evil globalist who wants to control and depopulate the world. Can you tell who is who?

It’s official. The Fed has gone absolutely wild, and it looks like it’s going to lend money to anyone and everyone and buy every toxic asset on the planet. This would be a funny and outrageous line if not totally true. Oh, and the Fed is not worried about inflation and says there is “no limit to what it can do.” Inflation here we come.

AG William Barr showed a glimmer of hope that the coup plotters who tried to remove President Trump will someday be prosecuted. Barr told FOX News that there was “a whole pattern of events to sabotage the Presidency.” Is that the talk of a prosecutor that does not intend to prosecute? We will see.

The three main US indexes closed down more than 1.5%, while London’s FTSE 100 index ended almost 2.3% lower.

Firms with significant sales in China were among the hardest hit.

The coronavirus has killed 81 people in China with almost 3,000 confirmed ill, while at least 44 cases have been confirmed abroad.

The outbreak has coincided with the Chinese New Year, when travel and spending typically spikes.

Many Asian stock markets were closed on Monday for the holiday, but concerns about the impact of the virus on the Chinese economy were felt globally, weighing on travel and fashion companies.

Oil prices also dropped more than 2%, with Brent crude falling to $59.32 a barrel, as traders fear demand could drop if China’s economy stalls.

“The timing [of the outbreak] could not have been worse,” analysts at Oxford Economics said in a research note.

In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus, China has announced travel curbs and quarantines, while companies in China have advised staff to work from home.

Businesses are also offering workers longer holidays, as well as telling employees returning from the most affected areas to stay away from work.

Analysts compared the situation to the 2002 outbreak of Sars, which killed almost 800 people. In the aftermath, China’s annual growth slumped from 11% to 9%."
281,True,"The article suggests that the number of deaths from the Coronavirus is being overcounted and that there are financial incentives for misreporting. This implies a deliberate manipulation of data, which aligns with the definition of a conspiracy theory.",True,The article mentions the Centers for Disease Control and the government as actors responsible for misreporting the number of deaths.,True,The article states that the Centers for Disease Control overcounts cases and that the government has created financial incentives for misreporting. These actions contribute to the conspiracy theory.,True,"The article suggests that relying on the flawed numbers is destroying businesses and jobs and costing lives, indicating a negative consequence of the actors' actions.",True,"The article connects various events and observations, such as the broad definitions of COVID-19 deaths and the inclusion of presumed cases, to support the conspiracy theory.",True,The article implies that there is missing information and attempts to mislead the public by stating that the Centers for Disease Control overcounts cases and that the government has created financial incentives for misreporting.,"Over 86,500 people have reportedly died in the United States from the Coronavirus, and the fear generated by those deaths is driving the public policy debate. But that number is a dramatic overcount. Our metrics include deaths that have nothing to do with the virus. The problem is even worse as the Centers for Disease Control over counts even some of these cases and the government has created financial incentives for this misreporting. Relying on these flawed numbers is destroying businesses and jobs and costing lives.

“The case definition is very simplistic,” Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of Illinois Department of Public Health, explains. “It means, at the time of death, it was a COVID positive diagnosis. That means, that if you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death. It means, technically even if you died of clear alternative cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it’s still listed as a COVID death.”

Medical examiners in Michigan use the same definition. In Macomb and Oakland Counties, where most of the deaths occurred, medical examiners classify any deaths as Coronavirus deaths when the postmortem test is positive. Even people who died in suicides and automobile accidents meet that definition.

Still, these broad definitions are not due to a few rogue public health officials. The rules direct them to do this. Unlike other countries, “if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death,” as Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, recently noted.

Classifications go beyond even these broad categories. New York is classifying cases as Coronavirus deaths even when postmortem tests have been negative. Despite negative tests, classifications are based on symptoms, even though the symptoms are often very similar to those of the seasonal flu. The Centers for Disease Control guidance explicitly acknowledges the uncertainty that doctors can face. When Coronavirus cases are “suspected,” they advise doctors that “it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate.”

That isn’t just a theoretical issue. On April 21st, when New York City’s death toll rose above 10,000, the New York Times reported that the city included “3,700 additional people who were presumed to have died of the coronavirus but had never tested positive” – a more than 50 percent increase in the number of cases. …"

On one hand, the video platform has been hard at work demonetizing and un-recommending videos that could “misinform users” (i.e. conspiracy theories). On the other hand, YouTube is never stopped enabling the proliferation of thousands of deeply disturbing videos sexualizing children.

Indeed, on one hand, YouTube is using advanced “machine learning”, combined with an army of human moderators, to censor videos that basically consist of adults discussing topics that may or may not be 100% factual. On the other hand, YouTube is profiting from videos that clearly and unmistakably exploit children for the viewing pleasure of pedophiles. Maybe I’m crazy, but one of those things is way worse than the other.

Two years ago, I published an article entitled Something is Terribly Wrong With Many “Kids” Videos on YouTube which highlighted the shocking, disturbing and traumatizing content found in countless videos aimed at children. Because these videos often use popular characters such as Elsa to lure children into viewing the videos, this upsetting phenomenon was dubbed Elsagate by some online forums including Reddit.

My 2017 article also contained a section titled “Catering to Pervs” which exposed videos that are clearly made to please “child lovers”. These videos feature children wearing inappropriate clothes and doing inappropriate things while the pervs watching post inappropriate comments.

The existence of these videos has caused lots of controversy in the past two years. However, no clear action was taken by YouTube to stop this. In fact, things have gotten worse.

The video below exposes the disturbing extent of the problem. It explains how a regular YouTube viewer can end-up in a wormhole of “recommended videos” that basically consist of child exploitation. The comments are mostly bizarre “compliments” and timestamps to the most “revealing” parts of the videos. In short, it is a soft CP ring right inside YouTube.

Going deeper into WTF territory is kids doing ASMR videos. ASMR stands for “Autonomous sensory meridian response” and is described as “a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin” when one is exposed to specific sights sounds such as someone whispering.

There are videos on YouTube of children doing this kind of stuff. And these videos clearly cater to pervs. Here’s a video that sums up the issue.

How come these videos exist (and are being monetized) while others are being snatched off the platform for dubious reasons? On January 25th, a YouTube blog post announced the removal of “conspiracy videos” from its recommendation system.

Needless to say, the YouTube recommendation algorithm is a major source of traffic for YouTube creators. The makers of the videos affected by this policy (which is extremely broad and subjective) will have a hard time reaching their audience. Also note that, in a classic move of manipulation, the blog post uses flat earth ridiculousness to justify the censorship of a wide range of topics, including 9/11 and countless others that are not mentioned on there.

So the question needs to be asked: Why doesn’t YouTube use its “censorship” resources to fight a real, urgent and deeply disturbing problem? There are actual children that are being used by unscrupulous adults to generate money and to build a network of pedos right on YouTube. Why isn’t “machine learning” used to fight this evil instead of censoring debatable opinions and stifling free speech?

When one considers the fact that YouTube is directly connected with the occult elite, the answer becomes obvious.

I'm a little tired—by the way, every preacher in America, before he met a theologian, believed exactly what I'm preaching tonight! Theologians messed us all up—they messed me up for a while, I'll be honest with you—messed us all up! When I went off to college, I thought I had the words of God in this Book right here. When I was in college for awhile I found out I didn't. Not only that, I found out nobody did! Not only that, I found out you couldn't have them! Not only that, I found out there was no such thing as any book in all the world that had the words of God in 'em! But my Bible said that we're supposed to keep His “WORDS”; not His truths, not just His doctrine, but His “WORDS”! ... Mark 8:38,“Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.” Folks, here's what's happening in America. The old-time preachers that built this country believed that this Book right here had the words of God in it! Your grandpa and grandma, that built this country, shed their tears on this Book, thinking they had the very words of God in their hands. And fundamentalists ALL believed what I'm preaching tonight, until we got our own Bible colleges, and seminaries, and sent our professors off to train at the feet of Karl Barth, and Reinhold Neuber, Emil Brunner, and others, who said that the Bible does not have the “words” of God, it is the Word of God, and that all the Bible is not inspired word-for-word. So we did not want to be considered “unintellectual” by the intellectual community; we're not willing to be called “nuts” and “fools”—just chalk me up as a nut! Chalk me up as a fool! Yea!

Shipp, who is a former CIA Officer with a high security clearance, explains, “It all started from the fake dossier which led eventually to the appointment of Robert Mueller (Special Prosecutor) and the entire foundation is based on a falsity. . . . I understand the next revocation of security clearance is probably going to be Bruce Ohr because he crafted the fake dossier with Christopher Steele, and he may even have written the thing. . . . After the FBI supposedly fired Christopher Steele, Bruce Ohr had at least 70 communications (with Steele) back and forth talking about the ‘firewall’ is still there to protect us. Recent accounts show that Bruce Ohr either wrote the dossier with Christopher Steele or he wrote it himself in communication with Christopher Steele.”

So, the only piece of so-called evidence to frame Donald Trump came from the Department of Justice? Shipp contends, “Yes. Oh, they coordinated it for sure. There are 70 emails back and forth between Ohr and Steele crafting the dossier. So, the FBI and Department of Justice were intimately involved with the creation and publication of that dossier.”

Shipp goes on to say, “They even went further than that. The FBI and CIA counter-intelligence even placed an agent inside the Trump campaign.”

The MSM is laser focused on the recent Cohen plea and the Manafort conviction that have nothing to do with Russian collusion. The Left wants to remove Trump from office even if the Mueller investigation is illegitimate and started with phony documents and fraudulent wiretap warrant applications. So, don’t expect to hear of this failed coup to remove Trump from office from the propaganda mainstream media (MSM). Shipp says the MSM are conspirators, and Shipp charges, “We know the mainstream media (MSM) is not interested in the news. They have, from their editors on down and their corporate owners, an objective and, in this case, to remove Donald Trump. He stands against everything that they are, the Left or the ‘Dark Left’ as I call it. Trump is actually confronting the Shadow Government and Deep State, and he has them shaking. He has the news media shaking that pushes these really leftist things. So, they are intentionally and on purpose blocking the news and deleting the news about things like this soft coup, the (phony) dossier. . . . They are co-conspirators because they have reported against the President using the soft coup to make it look like it is legitimate. Their editors know better than this, and they are doing this intentionally and on purpose. They covered up Hillary Clinton’s obstruction and violation of the espionage laws. They also covered up the FBI’s false FISA applications, and they are complicit in all of this. . . . Now, and this is really difficult because this is a civil war I am talking about . . . they have . . . brought in social media as part of the coup against the President of the United States. That memo has just come out and it’s 45 pages long, and it is now proven that’s what they are doing. This is social media propagandizing together with the MSM against the Trump Administration.”

In closing, Shipp says, “I think we are at the beginning of a civil war. You’ve got the ‘Dark Left’ and you’ve got the Conservative people, the Constitutionalists. In progressivism, one of its tenets is to change the Constitution, especially the First Amendment, and uproot traditional America. Whatever happens in November is going to intensify that. . . . Their attack is against Christians and the Constitution.

In response to recent claims by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) that she's ""the boss,"" veteran actor James Woods blasted the Democratic socialist, calling her an ""arrogant idiot"" and reminding her that she works ""for us.""

Woods took to Twitter and reposted a statement from Ocasio-Cortez in which she declared that ""we're in charge"" and told senior Democrats who don't support her ""Green New Deal"" they are ""just shouting from the cheap seats.""

“So, you may have missed this, but the way it works in America is YOU work for US,"" Woods said.

""The last time somebody told Americans to sit down and shut up was 1776.

“If you ever learn to read, look it up.

""You are not only a idiot, you’re an arrogant idiot, and there is nothing more dangerous.”

According to Breitbart, Ocasio-Cortez rattled the cages of the Democratic establishment in a social media post on Friday over their criticisms of her Green New Deal.

“Yup. If you don’t like the Green New Deal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis,” she said.

“Until then, we’re in charge – and you’re just shouting from the cheap seats.”

Woods, one of the few outspoken conservatives in Hollywood, criticized the New York Democrat last month, calling her the most dangerous person in America.

“This is the most dangerous person in America right now. Ignore her at your peril…” the Casino actor said.

Indeed, in a livestream over the weekend, the 29-year-old congresswoman can be seen ranting about the end of the world due to climate change.

“The whole premise of the Green New Deal is that we’re screwed on climate,” the socialist congresswoman said.

“At this point, we don’t even have to prove it, just walk outside in winter in a lot of places, and it’s either way, worse than you’re used to, or way warmer than you’re used to.”

Popular radio and TV host Alex Jones, founder of Infowars, “invaded” the Washington, D.C. “swamp” on Tuesday to hold a press conference aimed at drawing attention to the rising censorship of pro-Trump media as well as a series of retaliatory lawsuits aimed at shutting him down.

During a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session, Jones — along with longtime Trump advisor Roger Stone and investigative journalist Dr. Jerome Corsi, among others — laid out in detail how media supportive of the president are being targeted for destruction by the Left’s media, political, social, and cultural apparatuses.

In addition, Jones and his presenters said that the battle against what is amounting to outright censorship by the big Left-leaning social media giants — Facebook, Google, YouTube, and Twitter — is not one independent media can afford to lose.

Infowars, along with other news organizations that either support President Donald Trump or skew to the right, are increasingly being hit with “SLAP” cases — Strategic Lawsuit Against Participation filings — that “are designed to take people out of the public realm of debate,” Jones noted. They are “harassment lawsuits” financed by Left-wing billionaire George Soros and other ideologically similar groups aimed at shutting down speech and limiting information the public gets on a range of issues. (Related: Health Ranger Mike Adams fills in for Alex Jones to warn about the “online ethnic cleansing” happening now.)

One case, in particular, was filed by Brendan Gilmore, a witness to the incident in Charlottesville, North Carolina last year involving a car that rammed a group of protestors who gathered from the Alt-Left and Alt-Right to demonstrate for and against the removal of a Confederate monument in a nearby park. One person was killed; more than a dozen others were injured.

Gilmore, a State Department Foreign Service Officer, filed suit against Infowars and The Gateway Pundit after they publicized a video of the incident Gilmore uploaded to social media. The suit claims that “within 24 hours of uploading his video onto Twitter, the Defendants’ first blog posts about Mr. Gilmore appeared online, accusing him of being a CIA or ‘deep state’ operative.”

As reported by The Washington Times:

Specifically the lawsuit lists as defendants Alex Jones, his Infowars website and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, LLC; former Breitbart News writer Lee Stranahan; Infowars reporter Lee Ann McAdoo; Gateway Pundit publisher Jim Hoft; former U.S. Congressman Allen B. West; and bloggers Scott Creighton and Derrick Wilburn.

Jones addressed the suit at his press conference.

“It’s incredible who is funding this lawsuit,” he said, adding that it “looks like it was written by a three-year-old.”

“It’s bizarre how they take this Soros money and use it, but it is designed to overturn the First Amendment” or, at a minimum, make it moot for right-leaning publishers and media, he added.

In addressing the press, Stone said that “2016 was the year in which the mainstream media lost their hammerlock, their complete monopoly on political discourse” in the U.S. “Donald Trump’s election, in fact, the entire sea change in American politics, was only made possible through a robust, vibrant alternative media allowed through an unfettered Internet.”

He noted further that the gatekeepers of the “free and open Internet seek to put the toothpaste back in the tube” by shutting out anyone who opposes their views and ideology. He also said that the Left is using “lawfare and censorship” to shut down opposition media.

Dr. Jerome Corsi, a correspondent for Infowars, added that “we are at the beginning of what is going to be a second American revolution.”

The author of the new book, “Killing the Deep State,” noted further that the FBI raid against Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, was “thuggery” and part of the overall effort to shut down political opposition.

287,True,The article promotes the idea that vaccines are not effective and that the mainstream media and pro-vaccine advocates are misleading the public.,True,"The article mentions the mainstream media, pro-vaccine zealots, the government, and researchers from various organizations as actors responsible for spreading misinformation about vaccines.",True,"The article claims that vaccinated individuals are contracting and spreading diseases, contrary to the belief that vaccines provide immunity.",False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,"The article connects multiple instances of vaccinated individuals contracting and spreading diseases, suggesting a pattern of vaccine ineffectiveness.",False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Mainstream media reports are brimming with condemnation against parents who make the informed decision not to vaccinate their children, claiming that unvaccinated individuals are directly responsible for triggering the handful of recent measles “outbreaks” that have been reported across the United States. But studies show that it’s actually the vaccinated “herd,” in many cases, that’s actively contracting this chickenpox-like illness, as well as spreading it to others.

Though pro-vaccine zealots would like us all to believe that the primary cause of infectious disease outbreaks are people who develop immunity naturally without getting jabbed with aborted human fetal tissue, synthetic chemicals, and other health-damaging toxins, the truth of the matter is that the “immunized” are the ones wreaking much, if not all, of the havoc.

A groundbreaking study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found that, contrary to the government’s unfounded claim that unvaccinated people are the ones putting public health at risk, vaccinated people are, in fact, capable of both becoming infected with the disease against which they’ve been vaccinated, as well as infecting others with it through secondary transmission.

A team of esteemed researchers from the Bureau of Immunization, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked at evidence from a 2011 measles outbreak in New York which, as usual, was blamed on the unvaccinated. What they found was that the cause of this particular outbreak was actually a vaccinated person.

A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.

As Natural News and others have been saying for many years, getting vaccinated doesn’t protect a person from disease contraction, nor does it prevent a vaccinated person from acting as a carrier for disease and spreading it to others. In this case, “vaccine-compliant” people were directly responsible for doing both, proving once against that vaccines like MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) don’t actually work.

“Of 88 contacts, four secondary cases were confirmed that had either two doses of measles-containing vaccine or a past positive measles IgG antibody,” the study explains. “All cases had laboratory confirmation of measles infection, clinical symptoms consistent with measles, and high avidity IgG antibody characteristic of a secondary immune response.”

Even being vaccinated TWICE with MMR doesn’t provide protection against disease

It’s important to reiterate that the individual to whom the New York measles outbreak was traced had been vaccinated not once, but twice, with the controversial MMR vaccine, which was more recently found to increase the mortality rate of measles infection.

“This is the first report of measles transmission from a twice vaccinated individual,” the study reveals, in no uncertain terms.

“The clinical presentation and laboratory data of the index were typical of measles in a naïve individual. Secondary cases had robust anamnestic antibody responses. No tertiary cases occurred despite numerous contacts. This outbreak underscores the need for thorough epidemiologic and laboratory investigation of suspected measles cases regardless of vaccination status.”

Put simply, a twice-vaccinated individual caused the 2011 New York measles outbreak by spreading the disease to four of her contacts, two of whom had also received two doses of MMR prior to contracting the illness and spreading it to others.

It’s a similar situation to what occurred during the infamous Disney measles outbreak, where many of those who became infected with measles during that incident had also been previously vaccinated. Once again, what all of this research proves is that the MMR vaccine doesn’t provide real protection against disease, and can actually cause virus “shedding” that results in other people, including other vaccinated people, contracting disease.

“The moral of the story is that you can’t blame non-vaccinating parents for the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases when vaccination does not result in immunity and does not keep those who are vaccinated from infecting others,” comments Sayer Ji from GreenMedInfo."

When it comes to vaccine safety, it’s an undeniable fact that the general public simply isn’t being told the full truth about what many vaccine apologists falsely claim represents the “greatest medical breakthrough” in history. Many people – primarily children – are, in fact, injured or killed by vaccines on a regular basis, and yet only about one percent of such cases are actually reported to health authorities.

According to the government’s own internal assessments of vaccine adverse events, only a tiny fraction of vaccine injuries and deaths actually make it into the official datasets used as backing for official vaccine policy. This means that the safety and effectiveness claims about vaccines that are propagated by entities like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the vaccine industry itself, are based on inadequate – and thus false – information.

Meanwhile, billions of dollars are quietly handed out in “vaccine court” as part of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), which exists in lieu of the fact that vaccine corporations are no longer liable for the injuries and deaths caused by their products.

“The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) was launched by President Reagan in 1986 as an ‘alternative remedy’ to judicial action for vaccine injuries,” writes Dena Schmidt for NaturalHealth365.com. “A key component is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) with its own ‘vaccine court.'”

Winning cases in “vaccine court” is unjustly difficult for parents of vaccine-damaged and vaccine-killed children

It’s bad enough that “vaccine court” exists outside the bounds of the normal legal system, acting as a shield for vaccine corporations to continue churning out dangerous and ineffective vaccines without any risk or consequence to themselves. What’s worse is that, of the few cases of vaccine-associated injury and death that actually make it into vaccine court at all, less than one-third end up being compensated.

“While some victims do receive a legal victory, overall it seems like this program cares more about protecting the vaccine manufacturer,” Schmidt explains. “If big pharma is not held accountable for its actions, why should they focus on making vaccines safer?”

At the same time, the CDC has basically adopted the policy that there can never be too many vaccines on its official vaccine schedule, which ensures that the vaccine industry is well-taken-care-of financially. It’s a racket that benefits vaccine corporations at the expense of children’s health – and it’s unlikely to change anytime soon unless a critical mass of parents stands in solidarity against this endemic corruption.

Children vaccinated in accordance with CDC guidelines are exposed to 25 TIMES the amount of aluminum necessary to cause autism

Another often-overlooked factor in the vaccine debate is the sheer amount of chemicals that children are exposed to when they receive the dozens of vaccines on the official CDC schedule within the first few years of their lives.

A mere 25 micrograms (mcg) of aluminum for adults, and 10 mcg of aluminum for children, is considered the maximum threshold after which physical damage, and possibly even death, can occur. And yet, children vaccinated in accordance with CDC guidelines receive at least 250 mcg of aluminum in their bodies – or 25 times the “safe” level for children.

“Injecting neurotoxins into the human body is NOT ‘safe’ or ‘effective.’ It’s just wrong,” Schmidt concludes. “We, as concerned citizens, must educate ourselves and (always) make informed decisions about our healthcare.”

Have you looked up into the chemtrail skies lately? These aerial sprayings are slowly making people sick with their puffy white chemical soup. Neurosurgeon, Dr. Russell Blaylock recently talked openly about chemtrails and what they are doing to our health, but also how to detox them on this video.

Whether the pilots on huge C130’s know what they are doing, or are practicing the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil tactics encouraged by our US military (commanded by a corrupt government) they are dumping all kinds of chemicals on us at an alarmingly increasing rate. (There are plenty of amazing service-people who have even been whistle-blowers on chemtrails) .

It doesn’t matter if you believe chemtrails are a ‘conspiracy theory,’ though even though the US government coined the term ‘chemtrails’ before any blogger ever did; people will still get sick from their existence. Dr. Blaylock warns we will see an increase in numerous diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia, cancer, and upper-respiratory diseases just to name a few. But here is the good news – according to this particular neurosurgeon, you can help your body detox from some of the numerous chemicals in chemtrails (thorium, barium, mercury, aluminum oxide, and strontium).

Here is the list of things you can do to reduce the inflammatory response that is caused by some of these chemicals:
• Tocopherols in Vitamin E will help reduce inflammation in your brain and body, thus reducing the toxic effect of chemtrails. Almond milk is a great source of naturally occurring Vitamin E, as is
• Vitamin C, when added to Vitamin E, is a powerful protector of the brain, according to Dr. Blaylock.
• Curcumin binds with aluminum and helps to reduce its toxic effects, and supports its elimination from the body.
• Saffron is another great way to support brain health and detox these chemicals. It is also full of cancer-fighting carotenoids. In some studies, saffron has also shown to promote learning, memory and recall due to a compound in the plant called ‘crocin’.
• Flax seed has been shown to help reduce radiation poisoning and boost brain power as well.
• Cinnamon is full of antioxidants and can also reduce the inflammatory response in the body.

For further suggestions, you can watch the video, and start detoxing from chemtrails and their noxious poisons today.

His spectacular research effort, in the now declassified intelligence files preceding Pearl Harbor, reveals an evil that corrupts Washington to this day. Every premise, every assumption, every statement by military and political leaders-nearly every ""fact""- about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are now proven to be lies . Stinnett proves that FDR and other leaders were actually tracking the Japanese fleet across the Pacific- right up to the moment of attack. They were fully aware the purpose of the fleet was to attack Pearl Harbor.""

More importantly, Stinnett uncovered a detailed 8-point plan to provoke Japan into the attack, adding another link in the chain of proof that government insiders use provocations and war to manipulate changes in the balance of world affairs. Overall, he has provided a body of evidence so compelling that all but the most die-hard FDR apologists will finally be forced to concede the truth--that our own government set us up for war. But what is sad is that so few can see the deception while it is occurring. Most, like Stinnett, have to wait 50 years till there are enough security leaks to put the pieces together. Incredibly, even those who finally see the perfidy of FDRs ""day that will live in infamy"" fail to see the extensions of those same conspiracies and deception still going on.

Stinnett is one of those who fail to see that --that the same patterns of deceit persist today. In his introduction, Stinnett not only fails to be outraged by the material he uncovers , he goes to some lengths to excuse FDR's sacrificing the lives of more than 2,000 Americans in Hawaii, in order to ""save the world for Democracy.""

That wasn't FDR's motive at all. The pattern of events surrounding the strange prosecution of the war in both Europe and the Pacific paints an entirely different picture (unless one carefully understands the insiders definition of ""democracy""--a global massing of ignorant, manipulated majorities for the purpose of undermining US constitutional protections of true fundamental rights). There were many secret US/British maneuvers executed during WWII to ensure a Soviet victory over Eastern Europe, the transfer of atom bomb technology to Russia, the forcible return of unwilling Soviet ""expatriates"" to Stalin (Operation Keelhaul) and the shifting of valuable military supplies from MacArthur to Russia in the Far East (that came back at us in Korea). All of these actions, and many many more, point to a much broader plot to use Hegelian ""create your own enemy"" tactics designed to keep the world in , inexorably leading to a and the --a process that continues today.

Stinnett can be partially excused for his naiveté. Just as the Pearl Harbor plot was a carefully crafted secret, so is this larger, over-arching plot. Ironically, Stinnett served under Lt. George Bush during WWII, who was later to become the prime insider president using the Gulf War to facilitate a giant leap forward in the New World Order strategy. Despite the authors weak conclusions, you should all have a copy of this book in your personal library. Its a major part of the puzzle on conspiracy in government that may help convince others to look deeper."

German Government confesses to having 'no plan' for 120 captured Jihadists

The German Government had admitted to losing track of 160 ISIS fighters, who traveled to Syria to fight for the Islamic State, before returning to Germany.

Officials also confessed to having ""no plan"" for the 120 Jihadists that have been captured and are currently being held in the Middle East.

According to a newly published intelligence report, Angela Merkel’s government found that, of the 1,000 German nationals who traveled to join the group, 350 have returned.

While some of these ISIS members have been apprehended, currently in German jails awaiting trial, many were able to get back into Germany and escape the authorities.

Of those that haven't returned, some died in battle while others remain in Kurdish prisons in Iraq and Syria.

The intel report states that the returnees could pose a significant security risk.

“In principle, it must be assumed that Islamist attitudes prevail in most cases,” the report warns.

“Their ability to move inconspicuously in Western countries, from the jihadi groups’ perspective, predestines the returnees to plan and commit attacks in their home countries.”

Many of the attacks to have hit Germany and other Western countries in recent years have been carried out by people pledging allegiance to Islamic State.

Steve Alter, a spokesman for the German government, has said the government faces a big challenge in bringing former ISIS soldiers to justice.

Trying other former fighters in Germany has proved difficult in the past, owing to high standards of evidence, such as photos or social media accounts, demanded in German law.

The German parliament has now passed legislation that strips Germans with dual nationality of their citizenship if they join foreign terrorist militias.

Frank Jensen, who writes about extremism for German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, told Fox News that each prisoner must be thoroughly investigated in Syria or Iraq before they can be brought to trial in Germany.

“We have a huge danger from Islamic terror in Germany, and many people don’t want them to come back.”

Jesus come back soon!’ Shakira, Jennifer Lopez Super Bowl halftime show shocks Christian viewers across the country

I was doing our weekly radio show during the Super Bowl tonight, but I was able to catch a little of the halftime show. And when I say “a little” I mean about 15 seconds because what I saw was nothing but filth, and sex and perversion as far as the eye could see. The idea that children were watching this was mind-numbing to me. At times it bordered on the level of soft-core pornography. The NFL should be ashamed of themselves, and so should any parent that allowed little kids to view it. The Super Bowl is more like a Roman orgy, so it was fitting they play in stadiums that look like a Roman Colosseum.

“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.” 2 Timothy 3:1-5 (KJB)

This theme of sexual perversion ran right though all the famed Super Bowl commercials as well, produced by people pushing and promoting the values of the radical Left with effeminate men, drag queens and all the rest of that garbage. With each passing year I find myself watching less and less professional sports, and now I am at the point of abandoning it altogether. What are your thoughts? Comment below. One thing for sure is, I will never again watch a Super Bowl halftime show. And no, I have not included a video of the Super Bowl halftime show, I could not post that in good conscience. Super Bowl? More like toilet bowl.

Many took issue with the overtly sexual Super Bowl performances

FROM STAR-TELEGRAM: Some fans are not happy with the Super Bowl halftime show featuring singers Shakira and Jennifer Lopez. Complaining about the dance-heavy and scantily-clad performance started popping up on Facebook and Twitter before it wrapped up.

Many took issue with what they deemed overly sexual, including “crotch-grabbing” and suggestive “pelvic thrusts.” “Finish the Race,” a religious conservative group that bills itself as “Christians engaged in politics and social restoration,” complained that it was the work of “social justice warrior activism.”

Of course, there were many more fans declaring that it was the greatest halftime show in history. But even among those that enjoyed the performance, social media memes and jokes about how sexual it was flooded social media. READ MORE

We then these oxygen molecules into our lungs which is then through bound to red blood cells using a protein called haemoglobin, this protein four iron atoms, which can bind four atoms of oxygen blood cell.



Now, exactly what the of these charged oxygen molecules is relatively unchartered , but what we know is that the lungs work most when they are receiving oxygen in its natural state, MMW charged oxygen molecules will not bind as well to the iron atoms in the haemoglobin, in fact is suggestion that these oxygen molecules repelled by the iron.



The effects on the body because of lack of oxygen are:

Going back to the Coronavirus video’s of people literally falling over in the middle of the street, could this be explained by a lack of oxygen? It certainly could.

The literature on Magnetic Biology is vast and extremely technical, few work in the field but we will try to get a better understanding of just how these oxygen molecules could affect our ability to absorb oxygen – once we have more on this we will update this post.

The question is what about the coronavirus? While I wont pretend to have the answer, here is a theory to what could be going on.

The coronavirus COVID-19 may simply be a modified SARS virus which was held at the WUHAN laboratory which was INTENTIONALLY released to cover up a frightening reaction people began getting from the s of this new 5G technology.

the virus clearly exists, its genetic structure was publically released back in December, but why is it only affecting isolated groups of people so severely, but in the majority of cases it hardly affects the infected – in fact many contract the virus with no side affects whatsoever.

Could this simply be a coverup to protect the validity of 5G technology?

What is geoengineering? It’s the large scale intervention and manipulation of the global climate system through various means, the most popular seems to be spraying reflective substances into the air via aircraft or balloons in order to reflect the sunlight back into space.

Within the past few years, multiple academic institutions have initiated geo-engineering research departments. Harvard University, for example, recently created one. There is also the SPICE project (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering).

SPICE is a United Kingdom government funded geoengineering research project that collaborates with the university of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol to further examine the idea of Solar Radiation Management (SRM).

I recently published an article about a conference held at Harvard on the topic, where they issued this report that elaborates on what these programs will take, their potential implications, feasibility and more. You can watch some of the speakers at the conference here.

The discrepancy when it comes to geo-engineering comes from the idea that they’re grouped into the word chemtrails. Chemtrails is a term used to describe what several people have been seeing in the skies for years; a path of chemicals being sprayed by airplanes all over North America.

Some argue that they are simply contrails from the engines of the plane, but multiple sources say otherwise, and for them to completely cover the sky over the period of the day and never disappear, has also raised suspicion among those who are paying attention.

Nevertheless, a paper from Dr. Rose Cairns, PhD., who belongs to the University of Leeds School of Earth and Environment, published in the peer-reviewed Geophysical Journal titled “Climates of suspicion: ‘chemtrail’ conspiracy narratives and the international politics of geoengineering” describes developments in mainstream academic and political discourse regarding geoengineering, and how climate modification, also being discussed by the citizens of the world (who use the term “chemtrails”), is having devastating ecological and health effects worldwide.

According to her paper:

“Understanding the emerging politics of geoengineering, and taking seriously claims regarding the importance of public participation, requires an understanding of the whole discursive landscape around ideas of global climate control – including marginal ideas such as those held by chemtrail activists.

“Ignoring or dismissing these discourses out of hand as pathological or paranoid is to ignore potentially revealing insights about the emerging politics of geoengineering.” (source)

“This analysis suggests a number of ways in which the chemtrail narrative may contain important insights and implications for the emerging politics of geoengineering that cannot be dismissed out of hand as ‘paranoid’ or ‘pathological’.” (source)

This may be why so many people over the years, even many celebrities like Prince, are speaking about chemtrails is because there is ample evidence to suggest that these programs are already operational.

Another Alarmist Issue Without Scientific Context

“It occurred to me….” To avoid political correctness and say what they really think people say, let me play Devil’s Advocate.

One minute people say government does too much, the next they demand action to resolve problems. Environmentalists demand government stop global warming, but oppose remedial actions like spreading iron filings on the oceans to increase uptake of CO2 or spraying chemicals into the atmosphere to create clouds (chemtrails) to block sunlight and reduce global temperatures. Both actions are wrong because they constitute geo-engineering – governments playing God. The real problem is neither governments nor opponents know what is happening, but think they do, so demand action. Doing nothing is better if you don’t understand, contrary to the false claim of the precautionary principle. Environmental issues are a war and as Aeschylus said “In war truth is the first casualty”.

Figure 1 shows the different atmospheric layers each defined by temperature changes that reflect different chemistry.

The critical boundary is the Tropopause between the Troposphere, where 99% of the weather occurs, and the Stratosphere. It’s a very distinct boundary marking different density of gases and a change in temperature from a decrease with altitude to an increase. There are few gases thinly spread in the Stratosphere.

Figure 1 shows the Tropopause at 17 km. Actually, this varies considerably from Equator to Poles, mostly because of temperature. Seasonal temperatures also create differences. Variation at the Equator is 17 km (winter) to 19 km (summer). At the Poles it is 7km (winter) to 10 km (summer). Seasonal range is greater at the Poles because of greater seasonal temperature range.

Naturally, it is far more complicated. Understanding of some Troposphere dynamics are very recent. The Tropopause is not continuous, being broken by wind circulation patterns as Figure 2 shows.

Twenty years ago my graduate class in Applied Climatology involved a briefing as a commercial pilot flying from Winnipeg to Vancouver. I realized most flights were partly in the lower Stratosphere. Since then these flights have increased because of better aircraft pressurization and more efficient engines in colder temperatures at higher altitudes.

I learned of changing flight patterns when flying search and rescue in northern and Arctic Canada. Flights increased significantly because of the end of the Cold War. with Existant depuis deux petites annees seulement, le machine a sous en ligne avec croupiers en direct, ou live machine a sous , fait quant a lui deja un tabac. more flights over greater distances and different routes. The amount of traffic has increased significantly, especially the number of flights to Asia, most of which fly out of North America using “great circle” routes that brings them over western North America and Alaska or over the Pole.

Great circle routes take Asian bound aircraft across the general westerly flow of the upper level winds. This means condensation trails and high level clouds, especially Cirrus and contrails in the lower stratosphere are being dispersed in the same direction. Temperatures at these altitudes mean most of the gases condense directly to ice crystals. This makes them very visible, but also slow to dissipate.

A Contrail is exhaust from an aircraft engine cooling very rapidly below the dew point temperature and condensing into a visible trail of microscopic droplets. Through binoculars you can see the gap between the jet engine and the beginning of the trail. Earlier I mentioned that the gas constituency of the lower Stratosphere, where these planes fly, is different being much thinner and colder than in the upper Troposphere. Aircraft exhaust is a much higher percentage of total gas in the Stratosphere. This creates very different contrails, rates of dissipation and other factors. I mentioned that there are clouds in the lower Stratosphere called Noctilucent clouds. Here are some pictures of these clouds from Wikipedia.

Compare those images with these of Cirrus clouds also retrieved from Wikipedia.

Many confuse noctilucent clouds with chemtrails or contrails. Many confuse lower stratosphere contrails with chemtrails. It’s probably because most they want to see chemtrails. I’ve received many photos as evidence of chemtrails that are contrails, high cirrus or noctilucent events.

Noctilucent cloud occurrences are reportedly increasing. Is it possible the increase is because noctilucent clouds

These are the latitudes at which most flight increases have occurred. It is likely the increase in reported chemtrails are actually contrails from lower stratosphere flights.

There may be issues with flights in the stratosphere but nobody is really looking, possibly because the obvious solution is politically unattractive. Fuel consumption increases at lower altitudes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) doesn’t include the lower Stratosphere in their models. From the 2007 Science report,

The QBO is linked with El Nino/La Nina. They, as well as ozone and clouds in the Stratosphere, are significant factors in Tropospheric weather. Some claim Stratospheric changes explain global temperatures better than IPCC and other models. Lu et al wrote

We need answers from science free from politics. People need to sort out what actions and issues governments should be taking, but we can only do that if we understand the issues. Since we don’t, it is better to do nothing. We must avoid the irresponsibility of the precautionary principle.

 by Joe Quinn, Signs of the Time, Nov 06, 2006 

 t the time, much was made of the capture of Saddam Hussein. Touted by the US government-controlled American mainstream press as a fatal blow to the insurgency that would lead to rejoicing in the streets of Baghdad, the reality, as we have seen, has turned out to rather different. Iraqis, logically enough, seem to be less concerned about Saddam's capture and trial than about the fact that a brutal US military force of occupation has essentially taken possession of their country and its resources and has caused the deaths of 655,000 of their fellow citizens. 

 

 After his initial capture in December 2003, Saddam was paraded in front of the press at his first court appearance in July 2004 where he stood accused of up to 12 crimes, including the alleged gassing of the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988. But fate (and in Iraq these days ""fate"" wears the red white and blue ) has decreed that ""Saddam"" will not suffer the ignominy of answering those particular charges because his first trial for the killing of 148 people in a Shiite town in 1982 was enough, it seems, to convict and sentence him to death. The sense of relief in the White House over the fact that the ""gassing"" allegation will not have to be dissected is surely palpable, given that, if Saddam gassed anyone, it was with the chemical weapons supplied to him by the US government. 

 

 When he first appeared in court in 2004, Saddam was weak and pale and could be hardly heard. Strangely, the US military instituted a severe clampdown on media coverage of the proceedings which were not broadcast live. Frustrated members of the press had to wait until after the event to receive just FOUR minutes of audio and just a few seconds of video of the occasion. Furthermore, Saddam's lawyers claimed that they had been denied access to their client and that they had received death threats from members of the Iraqi government. While no mainstream media outlet at the time offered an explanation of these strange occurrences, logic would suggest that there is something about the man that appeared in court that the US military did not want the Iraqi people and the rest of the world, to see, or hear. It is one thing to present a few seconds of specifically chosen footage of a possibly drugged or mind programmed Saddam lookalike on television and thereby half-convince Iraqis that knew Saddam that the person in court is the real deal. It is a much more difficult task however to make an impostor's voice sound like the real Saddam's. There is also the danger that the impostor might suddenly and unexpectedly reveal his true identity. It seems likely that it was for this reason that the US military had to limit and edit the audio coverage and then ""clear"" it for broadcast.

This Secretly & Clandestinely forced us into Debt Slaves whereby our Leaders agreed to a system that allowed Britain to retain Sovereignty over the USA until 2018 when Queen Elizabeth surrendered to Donald Trump on July 13, 2018.

During the Bankrupt period, your Birth Certificate became Stock documenting ownership by Britain who enforced their Legal System under Admiralty Maritime Law of the Sea onto American citizens. This Sleight of hand by the Khazarian Mafia on behalf of Britain & the Vatican ensured our slavery by authorizing the American BAR Association to be under the jurisdiction of the British Crown due to USA Bankruptcy.

Recent Military acts and the Executive orders under the Trump administration is returning America to a Sovereign Country and removing the Private Federal Reserve from Rothschilds Family Control who aligned with the Vatican & The English Crown to Enslave Americans into being a Tax Farm. The recent Coup and assassination attempts against Donald Trump was due to his rejecting the old Guard of Establishment politics when he completed the mission of President John F.

A pop group was suspected of abusing girls at a paedophile brothel visited by Jimmy Savile, according to a secret police report.

The four-page document, which Scotland Yard tried to suppress, reveals how Savile and the unnamed band visited the flat in the 1960s.

The identities of the music stars aren’t revealed in the report, which was only released following a lengthy Freedom of Information battle.

It is also unclear whether the group visited with Savile, who was described as a “ well known disc jockey ”, or separately.

The report, marked “RESTRICTED”, was written by Detective Superintendent David Gray, the officer spearheading Operation Yewtree, the investigation into Savile and other celebrities suspected of sexual abuse.

Mr Gray examined the paedophile brothel case after it was highlighted by another official report in 2013 into what police knew about Savile’s abuse before he died.

Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary revealed that a man was jailed for two years for pimping two children’s home girls staying at the flat in Battersea, south west London. The HMIC report made not mention of the band visiting the flat.

Mr Gray found the intelligence in the 1964 ledger may have helped officers in 2003, when a victim contacted the force to reveal an attack by Savile in the 1970s.

The woman told police she was 15 when she was assaulted by the BBC star during a recording of Top Of The Pops.

The victim said she would make a witness statement but would only consider proceeding with a prosecution if other victims were found.

But the intelligence from 1964 wasn’t discovered because the records were never transferred to a computer database.

Years after Savile’s visits to the Battersea flat he became a regular visitor to the Duncroft school in Surrey, where the girls he is suspected of abusing in the Battersea flat had run away from.

Mr Gray’s report said of the 1964 ledger: “There is no evidence to suggest that as a result of this entry any investigation was or was not carried out.

“The reading of it is subjective in that we now know that Savile became a visitor at Duncroft some six years later between 1970 and 1978.

“However although Savile and a pop group were known to frequent that does not in itself show any linkage or grounds to investigate further, except with the benefit of hindsight.

“There would undoubtedly (have) been casepapers from that time, that may have been of assistance, but they are no longer available.”

The report added: “It would have provided useful background information to those officers who dealt with the 2003 allegation. But it would appear it was not transferred onto a digital format and hence not recorded on INI or PND [Police National Database].”

VANCOUVER, Canada – As continuing chemtrail activity culminated in massive aerial spraying over Vancouver Island and Washington state March 20, 2002, and broadening plumes once again fanned out to haze clear blue skies – Air Traffic Controllers at major airports across the United States expressed concern over the emissions constantly showing up on their radar screens.

These radar returns are the signature of the fine aluminum particles found in laboratory tests of chemtrail-contaminated rain taken in Espanola, Ontario in the summer of 1999. The lab analysis found reflective quartz particles in the chemtrail fallout — and levels of aluminum FIVE TIMES higher than Ontario’s maximum permissible health safety standards.

In a fourth interview with reporter S.T. Brendt last week, Deep Sky stated that Air Traffic Controllers at Chicago’s O’Hare airport, all three major airports in New York, Los Angeles LAX, San Francisco, Atlanta, Cleveland, San Diego, Washington DC’s Dulles and Jacksonville, Florida, were being ordered to route airliners beneath formations of Air Force tanker planes spraying something that regularly clouds their screens.

Every controller, without exception, is being told to divert traffic due to military exercises , and to bring in traffic lower because of experiments that may degrade their radars. The controllers at Cleveland’s airport were surprised by the extent of obscuration on their radars.

Ohio is the home of Wright-Patterson — the air force base working with electromagnetic and weather modification technology. A scientist working at Wright-Patterson recently told reporter Bob Fitrakis that two different projects are being conducted.

One involves cloud creation experiments to lessen the effect of global warming. Other chemtrails are connected with the military’s extremely high-power Radio Frequency beam weapon in Alaska called HAARP.

The scientist claims that the two most common substances being sprayed into chemtrails are aluminum oxide and barium stearate. When you see planes flying back and forth marking parallel lines, X-patterns and grids in a clear sky, that’s aluminum oxide, according to the scientist.

The goal is to create an artificial sunscreen to reflect solar radiation back into space to alleviate global warming. In some cases, barium may be sprayed in a similar manner for the purpose of high-tech 3-D radar imaging."

US military intelligence service DIA labeled this program the Stargate. They tried to figure out what other countries did on clairvoyance. In addition, research was done to clairvoyance and psychics were used by the government.

The Psychics were educated on remote viewing, precognition (seeing the future) and telepathy. They had to include information on targets that could not be approached in a conventional manner.

Para Psychologist and Professor Jessica Utts of the University of California – Irvine concluded after her review of the project that clairvoyance was clearly demonstrated.

The study suggested according to her clairvoyance works just like our other five senses, namely by observing change. It is possible that clairvoyance is a sort of sensing the future to find significant changes, much like our eyes scan the area for visual change, says Utts.

There are also many thousands of documents released on MK-ULTRA. In the fifties, the CIA secretly experimented on unwitting subjects with the aim of finding a way to brainwash people.

In 1974, the New York Times reported that the CIA between 1953 and 1963, and possibly longer, conducted under the headings Artichoke and MK-ULTRA had experimented on unsuspecting people. The newspaper discovered that the CIA developed brainwashing methods.

The then head of the CIA, Richard Helms, had the scandal already provided in 1973 and then burned all the evidence. A stack of documents, however, was misfiled and was found intact.

MK-ULTRA had branches in more than 150 sub-projects with experiments in more than 80 hospitals and universities. The documents on this secret program can be downloaded here or if you want to view them piece by piece click here. All together is about 90,000 documents.

On crowdfunding site Kickstarter there is launched a project to get the nearly 13 million pages of CIA documents public, that are currently still secret."

A “narco state” is a nation where nearly every aspect of society — politics, law enforcement, media, etc. — is controlled by narcotics traffickers. Mexico is a modern-day narco state.

America has collapsed into a pharma state, where all the most powerful corporations, regulators and government entities are beholden to pharmaceutical interests.
• The establishment media is largely funded by Big Pharma and uses its influence to promote pharmaceuticals while attacking nutrition and natural supplements.
• Federal regulators like the FDA and CDC function as little more than pharmaceutical cheerleading squads that hype the benefits of prescription medications (and vaccines) and protect Big Pharma’s profits through regulatory monopoly enforcement.
• The techno fascists like Google, Facebook and Amazon are all-in for Big Pharma, promoting prescription drugs by censoring natural health information while pursuing their own for-profit medication and vaccine retailing operations.
• Law enforcement is entirely controlled by Big Pharma, which is why the CEOs of powerful drug companies like GlaxoSmithKline are never indicted, even when that company admitted to running a nationwide bribery campaign involving 44,000 doctors. Instead of going to jail, they paid a fine to the DOJ and continue to conduct business as usual in the United States.
• The judicial system is overtly rigged in favor of Big Pharma, too. The vaccine has absolute legal immunity against lawsuits stemming from the millions of children who are harmed (and in some cases killed) each year by faulty vaccines made with toxic, dangerous ingredients. In America, no parent can due a vaccine manufacturer for the damage caused to their child by childhood immunization vaccines.
• The institution of “science” is totally corrupted by Big Pharma, and medical journals are almost entirely funded by pharmaceutical interests. Med schools teach doctors how to be little more than pharmaceutical vending machines, and even the “science” entries in Wikipedia are almost entirely engineered by Big Pharma sock puppets that pretend to be unbiased “editors.”
• Lawmakers in Washington D.C. are bought and “owned” by Big Pharma campaign donations and well-funded lobbyists. The pharmaceutical industry has more paid lobbyists in D.C. than even the weapons manufacturing industry or the oil industry.
• Even veterinary medicine is now totally corrupted by Big Pharma, to the point where vets largely just push vaccines and medications onto dogs, cats and even horses.
• These same pharmaceutical giants are pushing the FDA to outlaw CBD products and criminalize even non-THC cannabis as a form of natural medicine. This is being done, of course, to protect the monopoly profits of the opioid manufacturers that are killing tens of thousands of Americans each year while raking in billions in profits.

Schiff explains, “I think it’s a problem, and it’s not just Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank could be the weak link of a chain. If you remember back to when we had the financial crisis (2008). First, you had the sub-prime mortgages blowing up, and everybody was like don’t worry about it. It’s contained. I said it’s not contained, it’s just showing up first in the sub-prime market because these are the weakest mortgages. The entire mortgage market has a problem. I think the banking system has a huge problem because it’s lived off of the life support of artificially low interest rates. As that is removed, it’s like pulling the plug off of someone who has lived off life support. The irony is you have so many analysts that think higher rates are good for the banks. . . . Low interest rates saved the banks. You can’t have it both ways. It can’t be low interest rates helped the banks, and high interest rates will help the banks. It’s one or the other. I think higher interest rates are going to crush the banks. I think it’s going to destroy the value of their loans and their collateral. It’s going to lead to defaults . . . All those banks that we’re too big to fail in 2008 are much bigger now, and it’s going to be a lot more difficult to bail them out.”

Schiff issues a stark warning, “This is not going to end well, and I don’t think the Fed is going to be able to save us again. If you get it wrong this time, you’re done. You are down for the count. You just can’t hold and hope. If the stock market gets cut in half again, the Fed is not going to bail you out with another round of quantitative easing. They’re not going to bail you out with rate cuts because the next time the Fed tries to do that, it will destroy the dollar. I am confident of that. The next time is the last time. We will have a dollar crisis and a sovereign debt crisis. Then the U.S. can’t bail anybody out because it’s the U.S. that is in trouble. It will be the U.S. debt that nobody will want to own. It’s the U.S. dollar that nobody wants to own. Whatever the paper profits that people have because they have been in this bull market the last number of years, none of it is going to matter. The profits are going to go up in smoke as the market implodes.”

What about gold in a rising rate environment? Schiff says, “Gold can go up when rates are rising. In fact, gold will go up when rates are rising. Rates are generally rising because you have more inflation. More inflation is good for gold.”

The current theory suggests the US secretly supported the Islamic State so the Islamists would destabilize the government of Syrian President Assad. If that seems out of the question, remember the CIA once started a war over bananas… literal bananas.

Cuba: Probably the best known secret army. Castro nationalized the assets of western companies after his government took power, so the US decided to overthrow the government of Cuba and install a puppet regime. As with most of the armies backed by the US intelligence establishment, it failed. Miserably. The Bay of Pigs invasion saw 1400 US-trained Cubans surrender to Castro’s forces within 24 hours.

El Salvador: The US-supported Salvadoran government faced opposition from communist rebels. US intelligence saw an obvious and simple answer: establish death squads. US intelligence trained and advised pro-government forces as they massacred villages and led the way to the displacement of over a million people. Immediately after the ceasefire, there was a general amnesty for people implicated in war crimes. This amnesty was ruled to be illegal, but remains in effect anyway. Those seeking justice are often burglarized and the evidence of CIA involvement is stolen.

Afghanistan: The US armed and trained the Mujaheddin fighters through Operation Cyclone. Later, many of these fighters would form the core of the fundamentalist Islamic terrorist groups we are fighting (or possibly supporting) today. Yes, Osama bin Laden was one of the fighters trained by the CIA in Afghanistan. The whole operation was carried out to stop the Soviet invasion.

Guatemala: This little CIA caper is the origin of the term “Banana Republic.” The democratically elected President of Guatemala decided to punish the United Fruit Company for decades of consorting with the country’s dictators. He began to propose legislation to end the US multinational’s monopoly on almost everything in the country. So what else could the CIA do? The agency overthrew the legal government and triggered a war… over bananas.

309,False,The article does not suggest any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions Paige A. Thompson as the person responsible for the data breach.,True,The article describes the actions of Paige A. Thompson in hacking into Capital One's server and stealing data.,True,"The article mentions that personal information of Capital One customers was compromised, putting them at risk of identity theft and other criminal exploits.",False,The article does not mention any patterns or connections between events.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"A Seattle woman, formerly employed as a software engineer, has been charged with stealing more than 100 million Capital One credit review accounts.

Paige A. Thompson (33), was led away on July 29, 2019, and is currently being held in custody by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

After being alerted by an anonymous tipster, Capital One staffers responded to the data breach on July 19 — wasting no time fixing “the configuration vulnerability that this individual exploited,” and immediately contacted federal law enforcement officials for help.

Court records indicate that Thompson hacked into the millions of Capital One credit card application records between March 12 and July 17.

In a news release called “Capital One Announces Data Security Incident” and dated July 29, 2019, the international credit card issuer “determined there was unauthorized access by an outside individual who obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for its credit card products and to Capital One credit card customers.”

Capital One, a bank headquartered in McLean, Virginia, was quick to add that, despite continuing investigation, “we believe it is unlikely that the information was used for fraud or disseminated by this individual.”

Richard D. Fairbank, Chairman, and CEO of Capital One, said he was “deeply sorry for what has happened. I sincerely apologize for the understandable worry this incident must be causing those affected and I am committed to making it right.”

“Those affected,” as Fairbank put it, are 100 million U.S. residents and an estimated 6 million more in Canada.

Capital One maintains that “no credit card account numbers or log-in credentials were compromised and over 99 percent of Social Security numbers were not compromised.”

That 1% of credit card customers at the highest risk for identity theft and other expensive, potentially life-destroying criminal exploits by being compromised in this incident were, according to Capital One:
• About 140,000 Social Security numbers of their credit card customers
• About 80,000 linked bank account numbers of their secured credit card customers
• About 1 million Social Insurance Numbers of their Canadian credit card customers

Thompson hacked into a Capital One server on March 22 and 23 and made off with data on consumers and small businesses that applied for a Capital One credit card product between 2005 through early 2019. “This information included personal information Capital One routinely collects at the time it receives credit card applications, including names, addresses, zip codes/postal codes, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and self-reported income,” according to the company’s official statement.

The hacker also secured parts of credit card customer data, including:
• Fragments of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016, 2017 and 2018

A criminal complaint says Thompson “recognizes that she has acted illegally” and tried to share the information with others online:

“Thompson posted the information on GitHub, using her full first, middle and last name. She also boasted on social media that she had Capital One information.”

Someone who saw Thompson’s GitHub messaging alerted Capital One to the “leaked data” involving its corporate customers. It was then that Capital One contacted the FBI which dispatched an agent to search Thompson’s residence on July 29 who found “devices in her possession that reference Capital One and Amazon as well as other entities that may have been targets of attempted – or actual – breaches.”

The U.S. Justice Department has charged that Thompson detailed how she broke into Capital One in messages she posted in a Slack business-oriented chat service channel. Allegedly, she wrote that she had a custom program to download files from a Capital One directory stored on Amazon servers:

“I wanna get it off my server that’s why I’m archiving all of it lol.”

Thompson’s online identity was thinly veiled. Her alleged Slack username “erratic” was the same as the one she used on a Twitter account as well as a Meetup group chatroom page.

Thompson also tweeted her desire to “distribute Social Security numbers along with full names and dates of birth,” according to the FBI special agent who investigated Thompson.

Capital One’s legal team has proposed the usual remedies for heinous data hacks their data network security systems were incapable of preventing:

“Free credit monitoring and identity protection available to everyone affected.”

Capital One is nothing if not contrite in the wake of their online security failure:

“We have invested heavily in cybersecurity and will continue to do so. We will incorporate the learnings from this incident to further strengthen our cyber defenses.”

Capital One has set up a consumer FAQ web page about the breach at www.capitalone.com/facts2019.

Historically, Thompson’s hack ranks in the top ten data breaches, including the infamous Equifax Hack of September 2017 which exposed the data of 143 million users who are at risk of identity and financial exploitation forever. The thieves, in this case, are still at large.

Capital One Financial Corporation’s stock (COF) dropped $10 after news of its massive customer data breach was revealed, from a high over $98 to a low of $89.29.

Will Capital One escape financial consequences to its ineffective customer data security? If Equifax is an example – and it is – then defrauded consumers should expect no remedial action. Capital One will provide 12 months of free “data protection services” – which include annoying inconveniences such as data freezes – and then walk away scot-free from the epic fail.

It is up to consumers to vote with their wallets. Just say no to banks that can’t guard their customers’ assets, including their most personal identifying information."

Canadians won’t be able to return to life as they knew it before the novel coronavirus pandemic until a vaccine is available, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday.

“Normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine for this… That will be a very long way off,” the prime minister said during his daily news conference on Canada’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

“We will have to remain vigilant for at least a year,” he added in French.

Trudeau’s comments came just after the release of modelling data that federal health officials have been using to inform Canada’s response to the pandemic.

The models suggested the first wave of the virus could end roughly sometime in the summer, but that further “wavelets” are possible in the following months.

Epidemic controls and surveillance will have to continue over that time so “the chains” of the virus don’t “reignite,” said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer.

Canada is developing “tools and habits” now that will allow the country to be “much more resilient and resistant to further outbreaks and spreads,” Trudeau later told reporters.

Even then, “there will be things we just aren’t able to do” for a year to 18 months, he added in French.

The prime minister urged Canadians once again to stay at home and limit their trips outside so the country can get through the first wave of the virus “as quickly as possible.”

While it’s unclear what extended epidemic controls would look like in Canada at this point, analysis by Harvard researchers, released March 27 ahead of peer review, suggested that multiple “intermittent” periods of physical distancing might be a more effective strategy for saving lives than continuing with “strict” distancing measures.

Health officials still aren’t sure where Canada is on the epidemic curve and won’t know when the virus has peaked until after that’s happened, Tam said."
312,True,The article suggests that Microsoft's ElectionGuard has several conflicts of interest and raises concerns about its ability to protect American elections. It also implies that there may be insider control over U.S. elections and raises questions about the real purpose of ElectionGuard.,True,"The article mentions tech giant Microsoft, companies with ties to the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, Israeli military intelligence, election forensics analyst Jonathan Simon, investigative journalist Yasha Levine, and Newsguard.",True,"The article discusses the development of ElectionGuard, the promotion of Microsoft's 'Defending Democracy' initiative, and the installation of Newsguard in public libraries and universities.",True,The article suggests that ElectionGuard and Microsoft's 'Defending Democracy' initiative threaten American democracy.,True,"The article connects events and observations, such as the development of ElectionGuard, the ties to the military-industrial complex, and the promotion of Newsguard, to suggest a larger conspiracy.",True,The article implies that there may be hidden intentions and covert actions behind ElectionGuard and Microsoft's initiatives.,"Earlier this month, tech giant Microsoft announced its solution to “protect” American elections from interference, which it has named “ElectionGuard.” The election technology is already set to be adopted by half of voting machine manufacturers and some state governments for the 2020 general election. Though it has been heavily promoted by the mainstream media in recent weeks, none of those reports have disclosed that ElectionGuard has several glaring conflicts of interest that greatly undermine its claim aimed at protecting U.S. democracy.

In this investigation, MintPress will reveal how ElectionGuard was developed by companies with deep ties to the U.S. defense and intelligence communities and Israeli military intelligence, as well as the fact that it is far from clear that the technology would prevent foreign or domestic interference with, or the manipulation of, vote totals or other aspects of American election systems.

Election forensics analyst and author Jonathan Simon as well as investigative journalist Yasha Levine, who has written extensively on how the military has long sought to weaponize public technologies including the internet, were consulted for their views on ElectionGuard, its connections to the military-industrial complex and the implication of those connections for American democracy as part of this investigation.

In January, MintPress published an exposé that later went viral on a news-rating company known as Newsguard. Officially aimed at fighting “fake news,” the company’s many connections to U.S. intelligence, a top neoconservative think tank, and self-admitted government propagandists revealed its real intention was to promote corporate media over independent alternatives.

Newsguard was among the first initiatives that comprise Microsoft’s “Defending Democracy” program, a program that the tech giant created under the auspices of protecting American “democratic processes from cyber-enabled interference [which] have become a critical concern.” Through its partnership with Microsoft, Newsguard has been installed in public libraries and universities throughout the country, even while private-sector companies have continued to avoid adopting the problematic browser plug-in.

Now, Microsoft is promoting a new “Defending Democracy” initiative — one equally ridden with glaring conflicts of interest — that threatens American democracy in ways Newsguard never could. ElectionGuard is touted by Microsoft as a system that aims to “make voting secure, more accessible, and more efficient anywhere it’s used in the United States or in democratic nations around the world.” It has since been heavily promoted by mainstream and U.S. government-funded media outlets in preparation for its use in the 2020 general election.

However, according to Jonathan Simon, election forensic analyst and author of CODE RED: Computerized Elections and the War on American Democracy, this public relations campaign is likely just cover for more insider control over U.S. elections. “It’s encouraging that after close to two decades of ignoring the security issues with computerized voting, there’s suddenly a scramble to protect our next election that suggests those issues are finally being taken seriously,” Simon told MintPress. “Unfortunately the proposed solution is just more computerization and complexity — which translates to more control by experts and insiders, though of course that is not part of the PR campaign.”

As to the likely identity of those insiders, the fact that Microsoft’s ElectionGuard was developed in tandem with a private military and intelligence contractor whose only investor is the U.S. Department of Defense offers a troubling clue. As a consequence, ElectionGuard’s promise to “secure” elections is dubious, especially given that Microsoft itself is a U.S. military contractor. Furthermore, amid the unfolding scandal of Israeli meddling in foreign elections, Microsoft’s growing ties to Israeli military intelligence and private Israeli cybersecurity firms raise even more concerns about whether ElectionGuard’s real purpose is to “secure” American elections for candidates friendly to the establishment, especially the military-industrial complex…."

At this point our government is nothing more than a criminal cabal that is steered by globalists and the multinational corporations they represent. A primary objective of global climate modification is to mask a completely disintegrating climate system from public view as long as possible. Secondary objectives are likely many, including ongoing weather warfare against opposing powers and even against our own citizens in the attempt to control populations. Criminal corporations like Monsanto are a part of the ongoing climate engineering insanity in a number of ways and for a number of reasons, none of them for the common good. Monsanto purchased ""Climate Corp"" in 2013 for almost a billion dollars so that they could help control the flow of weather information to the public. Aluminum is a primary element being used in the geoengineering programs, Monsanto is producing aluminum resistant seeds, is this just a coincidence? How many other agendas are being carried out against global populations by criminal governments and criminal corporations like Monsanto?

Think twice before you say weather control is just a conspiracy theory. Then ask yourself why Monsanto‬ owns patents in Geo-engineering. 



Weather undeniably affects food access and food costs. One glance at maps across the globe reveals that food production areas are being especially hard hit, and we are seeing prices rise accordingly. These natural events can be exploited both by speculators and governments. However, with the introduction of weather modification, invested in by those such as Bill Gates and openly promoted by elite globalist think tanks, concerns have been raised over the possibility that governments could use weather as a deliberate weapon to create food wars. Accusations have already been leveled charging exactly that. While some might dismiss the various possibilities of “steering the weather” for malevolent purposes as conspiracy, it is much more difficult to ignore the 1996 document presented to the Air Force titled Owning the Weather 2025, which explicitly states as a heading on page 10: Applying Weather-modification to Military Operations. One key section states that weather control could be virtual, as well as literal:

Offensive abilities could provide spoofing options to create virtual weather in the enemy’s sensory and information systems, making it more likely for them to make decisions producing results of our choosing rather than theirs. It would also allow for the capability to mask or disguise our weather-modification activities….

Also key to the feasibility of such a system is the ability to model the extremely complex nonlinear system of global weather in ways that can accurately predict the outcome of changes in the influencing variables….

Conceivably, with enough lead time and the right conditions, you could get “made-to-order” weather.

This would certainly be the ultimate endgame for anyone wishing to use food as a weapon of control and profit. This possibility should not be easily dismissed, but rather it warrants open-minded investigation and research.

”If you control the food supply, you control the people” – Henry Kissinger

Geophysical Warfare — “Rainmakers.” During the Vietnam Conflict, our warfighters needed a way to interdict enemy traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. “Project Popeye” helped answer the call. China Lake adapted its cloud seeding technologies to enhance rainfall thereby significantly deterring enemy activity on the trail. This highly successful China Lake technology was also used in hurricane abatement, fog control, and drought relief."

Ryan, himself an Event 201 attendee, stated that it is time for authorities to come into your home to see who is COVID-19 infected and take them away for ‘treatment’.

It is impossible to extricate the World Health Organization from the Bill and Melinda Foundation, as the WHO has been bought and paid for by endowments from Bill Gates himself. Over the past decade, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been the largest private donor to the WHO. If you have enough money, anything can be done. This is how Bill Gates has established himself as an ‘epidemiologist’ when in fact he has zero medical or scientific training of any kind. But if you listen to the media, Gates is now a ‘recognized expert’ on infectious diseases. Hmm.

So let’s take a look at slimeball Dr. Michael J. Ryan. In 2005, Dr Ryan was appointed as Director of Global Alert and Response at WHO Headquarters. This role included management of WHO’s alert and response operations, epidemic preparedness and mass intervention, biosecurity, communicable disease control in emergencies/disasters, emerging and dangerous pathogens, infection prevention and control, influenza and implementation of the International Health Regulations. One thing conveniently left out of Ryan bio, however, is his attendance at the Bill Gates sponsored Event 201. That’s a pretty big thing to leave out.

Dr. Ryan, speaking in his official capacity as a leader of the World Health Organization, says that in order to contain the spread of COVID-19, we need to do two things. He says we need to start going house to house and pulling sick people out ‘for treatment’, whatever that means. And he says that the lockdown must continue until everyone has received a COVID-19 vaccination shot. Then after the shot is administered, people will receive a digital certificate of immunity. New World Order stooge Tony Fauci says he agrees with that. Make sure you watch the video at the bottom, it will prove to you everything said in this article is true. Trust, but verify, as Reagan always said.

WHO Official: It’s Time To Remove People From Their Homes

FROM ACTIVIST POST: Day by day, Bill Gates is revealing himself in his own words as he calls for strict lockdowns, which cannot and must not be lifted until the vast majority of the global population is vaccinated…

Last week a top WHO official stated that it is time for authorities to come into your home to see who is infected and take them away, for the greater good of course.

At the same time, a top White House Coronavirus Task Force Doctor who has serious conflicts of interest and appears to be on Bill Gates’ payroll, just admitted the mortality rate of this outbreak is being inflated. How could this be? READ MORE

Unlike our own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which only advocates for pharmaceuticals and vaccines, Korea’s CDC effectively cured, dare we use that word, a patient by delivering oxygen through a face mask, according to the local news service Newsis.

Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of Korea’s CDC, announced that only one of South Korea’s 21 remaining Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) patients is still in critical condition, while the rest have been released.

As for the oxygen therapy, Jeong explained that it effectively saturates a patient’s body with oxygen by delivering high doses of it. And as we’ve reported in the past, diseases of all kinds hate oxygen and simply can’t survive in its presence.

With this successful treatment, South Korea is confident that there are no additional “critically ill” patients within its border, despite earlier concerns that the virus might ravage high-risk patients.

Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) is a dream come true for the globalists, who never let a good crisis go to waste:

South Korea announces end to quarantine after successfully treating all known coronavirus cases

The situation is not as bright in nearby Japan, however, where an elderly woman who resided in the Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo died not long after testing positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).

With Japan reporting the highest number of Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) cases outside of China – there are now more than 250 confirmed cases – South Korea was worried that the same would happen there. But its use of effective therapies like oxygen has apparently stemmed the tide, at least for now.

For nearly a week, South Korea had not reported any new confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), but did announce that a total of seven former patients are now “fully recovered” and have been released.

All of this good news for South Korea led authorities to announce the end of a massive quarantine there where 700 South Korean nationals who had previously been evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the novel coronavirus, were being held.

Those who were in this quarantine reportedly thanked the residents of nearby Asan for supporting them during this difficult period of isolation. Park Jong-cheon, a South Korean basketball coach for a youth team in the Hubei Province of China, wrote in a message that he would “never forget the love” he was shown while in quarantine, and that all residents of Asan are welcome to visit him in Wuhan at any time.

Not so fast: South Korea reports one new coronavirus case on Sunday

It all seemed so great until yet another confirmed coronavirus case emerged in South Korea at the same time that the quarantine was set to end. The Yonhap News Agency is reporting that an 82-year-old man with no record of overseas travel tested positive for the disease, and is now being held in quarantine at the Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul.

This new case, which brings South Korea’s total number of cases to 29, is the first since the previous Tuesday, dashing hopes that perhaps the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) was no longer going to be an issue in South Korea.

As for the condition of this new patient, authorities have yet to make his status public. It also remains unclear whether he, too, will be receiving oxygen therapy.

After flip-flopping a handful of times over the past few weeks, it looks like the UK has finally cemented its status as the deadliest outbreak in Europe, with the UK death toll topping 32,000 on Monday, placing it decidedly above Italy’s 29,079, even though Italy still has confirmed more cases overall, according to a tally kept by Reuters.

Reuters reports that the milestone will probably “increase the political pressure on Boris Johnson”, who has been consistently blamed for not acting sooner to impose a countrywide lockdown, a decision he made at the behest of the government’s top viral experts, as Reuters’ own reporting readily confirmed early last month.

The difference-maker that finally put the UK over the top was a report from the UK national statistics office which found another 7,000 deaths in England and Wales since the beginning of the outbreak, as HMG pledges to account for ‘every death’ caused by the virus. The UK’s most recent death toll was 32,313.

This policy will almost certainly guarantee that the UK will emerge as the death-toll leader in Europe, heaping even more pressure on Johnson, who is still enjoying something of a bump in the polls from his hospital stint.

Notably, the new figures haven’t yet been reflected in the Johns Hopkins data, though that should change as the data are updated.

The political opposition in the UK – which is still processing the results of a snap election held late last year that delivered a surprisingly large majority for Johnson and his conservatives – has repeatedly bashed Johnson for waiting until hospitals were being overrun in Italy before he started closing schools and businesses. They also say his government was too slow to introduce mass testing and provide enough protective equipment to hospitals, issues we now know were in part due to China’s hoarding.

Even as the UK works to account for every death, calculations run by the FT and WaPo seeking to examine total “excess” deaths and comparing them to the number of confirmed coronavirus deaths in a search for discrepancies, the Office of National Statistics said 33,593 more people had died than average up to April 24 in England and Wales, compared to 27,365 cases in which coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificates, which means there are likely still more deaths in the UK that will be added to the total en masse.

• Facebook and the left-wing media have unleashed a coordinated, new assault on conservative speech, de-platforming, de-monetizing and blacklisting nearly all conservative content channels and news organizations.
• These actions by the techno-fascists (tech giants) and anti-America media are acts of treason during a time of war, designed to destroy the United States from within and shred our constitutional republic.
• The coordinated escalation of censorship against conservatives, Trump supporters, Christians and gun owners is likely a prelude to a planned massive false flag event which would likely involve staged mass shootings carried out by false flag operatives (deep state) who carry out a mass shooting in the building of a tech giant corporation such as Facebook or Twitter. The shooting would be coordinated by deep state, anti-American operators who recruit a convenient scapegoat (former military, psychiatric drug user, InfoWars bumper stickers, etc.) to take the blame and cement the official narrative that blames the violence on the “far right.” This would be endlessly cited by the establishment media to justify the permanent de-platforming of the independent media.
• President Trump must act decisively and declare these techno-fascists and journo-terrorists to be enemy combatants engaged in acts of war against America.
• The United States government must temporarily seize and shut down Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, Wikipedia and other tech giants engaged in these acts of treason against America. The top managers and CEOs of these organizations must be arrested by military police and subjected to military tribunals to face trials for their acts of treason against America. Control over Big Tech can be restored to the private sector only after the tech giants agree to respect the First Amendment rights of public users.
• It is also likely that an attempted execution of President Trump is in the works, and that independent media voices which support Trump are being universally silenced in order to control the official narrative once Trump is possibly executed by the deep state. President Trump is no doubt well aware of this threat and is likely taking extreme precautions to avert this action.
• The desperation of the anti-American deep state and its communist handlers leads to the realization that they may try “area effect” weapons of mass destruction in order to eliminate Trump along with potentially millions of other people. This could theoretically involve a nuclear weapon detonated in Washington D.C., or an area-effect chemical weapon or radiological weapon (dirty bomb) which is exploded near the White House when Trump is situated there. What has become clear is that the anti-American forces now running the tech giants, media giants and deep state are willing to kill an unlimited number of Americans as long as they remain in power and eliminate the Trump threat to their mafia-like control over the bureaucracy and intelligence community.
• The left-wing tech giants have been infiltrated and taken over by communist China. They are now almost universally acting in concert with China to destroy America from within. They are sharing technology with China and even developing technology to amplify China’s police state surveillance and control over its own enslaved population. After being deployed in China, these technologies will be rolled out in America unless the tech giants are stopped first.
• Google has a plan to use AI robotic systems (actual real-like “Terminator” robots) to eliminate most of what the globalists call “useless eaters.” This eventually includes communist Leftists who are also considered entirely expendable by the globalist powers. Leftists are “useful idiots” to the extent that they help achieve the desired elimination and mass murder of conservatives and Christians, but once that is accomplished, the Leftists are next on the chopping block.
• In summary, the extreme censorship of independent voices by the tech giants is just the first step to a much larger agenda of the annihilation of most of humankind and the replacement of humans with AI systems and automated robotic laborers. For humanity to be largely exterminated, independent information must first be eliminated, followed by the complete elimination of gun rights among citizens in order to disarm the citizenry as a step toward mass genocide carried out by governments or corporations (such as Google).
• The tech giants are not merely the enemies of America; they are the enemies of the human race and they actively seek to eliminate most of humanity, replacing humans with AI systems while the few remaining globalists rule the world through a science dictatorship and fascist thought control regime powered by relentless AI surveillance of the remaining citizenry.
• Ultimately, these remaining globalists believe they will merge with the machines and achieve a transhumanist transcendence, which will allow them to achieve digital immortality while, they believe, merging their consciousness with AI-augmented machines. Effectively, the techno-fascist globalists believe they will become gods. But they have to mass murder 6+ billion humans first, and they are more than willing to that since they value no lives other than their own. Watch the full video here, at Brighteon.com:"
319,True,The article suggests that there is a coordinated campaign to promote dangerous pharmaceutical products and that legitimate research on the harmful effects of vaccines is demonized and mocked.,True,"The article mentions pharmaceutical companies, vaccine makers, the Lewin Group, and United Health as actors involved in promoting vaccines and influencing research.",True,"The article describes the actions of pharmaceutical companies, the Lewin Group, and United Health in promoting vaccines and influencing research.",False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to suggest a coordinated campaign to promote vaccines and suppress legitimate research.,True,The article suggests that there is a lack of transparency and conflicts of interest in the research and promotion of vaccines.,"For those who may be critical of the process of vaccination, particularly its safety and effectiveness, it is a known fact that there has never been a study proving safety or effectiveness that was not linked to a pharmaceutical firm or vaccine maker.[1] Indeed, if vaccines were so easy to prove safe and effective, then certainly an entirely government-funded or independent agency would have done so by now.

With the recent mainstream media hype, however, one would be tempted to believe that such an independent study has finally taken place proving that the MMR vaccine is not linked to autism. However, brief research into the allegedly independent “review panel” of the new darling of the month “MMR is not related to autism study” reveals that this is not the case.

For instance, the organization that conducted the study is the Lewin Group, a corporate healthcare consulting firm based in Falls Church, Virginia. The Lewin Group works with a wide range of players in the medical establishment. Most notably major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Novo Nordisk among others. It should be noted that at least two out of these three corporations are not only vaccine proponents, they are vaccine manufacturers. The Lewin Group also works with a number of major medical and pharmaceutical associations and organizations like the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America association.

In addition to working with the federal, state and local governments, the Lewin Group works with avariety of foundations such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Heritage Foundation as well as a large number of hospitals, health systems, and healthcare providers. The Lewin Group is especially involved in major medical insurance programs like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Health Now New York, LA Care Health Plan, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Wellcare among many others.

In addition to these big connections to pharmaceutical companies and the medical establishment, the mainstream media attempts to present the Lewin Group as being free from the influence of their own clients and associates. In addition, the mainstream media conveniently leaves out the fact that the Lewin Group is not independent in as much as it is owned by the nation’s largest health insurer, United Health Group.

Interestingly enough, United Health has seen its business grow over the last year due to the surge in customers forced into the market under Obamacare. It is thus no small wonder why United Health lobbied so hard to even eliminate a “public option” from the Affordable Care Act during the stage in which the bill was being debated. United Health lobbyists used work provided by the Lewin Group as a basis for its argument that providing a public option would kill the private insurance industry. Those few democrats in the U.S. Congress that disagreed were apt to point out the conflict-of-interest between the Lewin Group’s findings and United Health’s desires, referring to the Lewin Group’s work as “so-called analysis” and “suspect.” It is thus highly unfortunate that the Lewin Group’s conflict-of-interest and shady findings could be pointed out in 2009 but not in 2015.

According to the mainstream media, these conflicts-of-interest do not exist. However, United Health has been a major promoter of vaccines through its health insurance programs and vaccination campaigns. (United Health is a parent organization to UnitedHealthcare) The promotion of vaccination by United Health has gone far beyond the realms of simply providing vaccines as a service or following medical recommendations. It has been a“comprehensive program designed to promote vaccines” complete with “targeted messaging for diverse populations across age, race and ethnicity to increase vaccine rates.”

United Health’s program through subsidiaries like UnitedHealthcare, also sought to “increas[e] awareness of the diseases and promot[e] convenient access points.” With all of this information correctly understood, it should be clear that the Lewin Group is no independent observer. To present it as such is at best dishonest and at worst part of a coordinated campaign to promote dangerous pharmaceutical products that have been demonstrated to cause serious damage to adults and especially children. While legitimate research has demonstrated the harmful effects of vaccines, particularly the MMR shot, it has been demonized and mocked; the researchers have been persecuted by whorish media outlets, unrestrained corporations and narcissistic medical fanatics. Meanwhile, hack studies and purchased scientists are presented as the epitome of scientific development.

The truth is that there has never been a study proving vaccines safe or effective that was not connected to a pharmaceutical company or a vaccine maker. The mainstream media’s recent jaunt has yet to change this fact.

Currently, one of the main American targets is Iran, which, in the midst of the devastating crisis of COVID-19, will now have to face the fury of the US, which do not intend to retreat in the imposition of international sanctions against Tehran.

The Persian country is one of the most affected by the catastrophe. With more than 2,700 dead, Iran is trying to survive the pandemic. Despite the huge number of victims, the country is already beginning to show signs of stability. President Hassan Rouhani assured the world that the country has a strong health system and is able to cope with the rapid progression of the disease. State health insurance would cover 90% of coronavirus-related patient costs, including donations and low-interest loans to those affected by COVID-19. Altogether, 20% of the national budget is being directed towards controlling the pandemic.

However, this priority given to fighting the pandemic is not universal, with some countries more concerned with continuing their geopolitical ambitions to the detriment of human well-being. The United States has repeatedly announced that international sanctions against Iran will not end, regardless of the state of crisis caused by the global pandemic. In the past three months, US sanctions against Iran's oil and industry have increased exponentially, due to escalating tensions between the two countries. US State Secretary Mike Pompeo has publicly stated that Washington intends to recover global restrictions on Tehran because of the alleged ""violation of its nuclear commitments"".

Previously, American sanctions had been imposed in 2018, following the unilateral withdrawal of the US from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Reasonably claiming that Tehran had violated the terms of the agreement, Washington initiated a series of coercive measures that, over the past few two years, cost Iran about $200 billion, according to official Tehran data, directly damaging the country's economy and weakening strategic sectors.

In a situation of humanitarian catastrophe, secondary tensions are expected to be minimized in favor of international cooperation against a common problem. Taking into account that the US has an even greater number of cases than Iran and that everything indicates that it will surpass the number of deaths, it would be reasonable that the Trump administration was less concerned with punishing another country and more interested in acting against the virus, be it helping other countries or just increasing their efforts to control internal chaos. However, the White House and the Pentagon do the exactly opposite. Sanctions against Iran not only continued but increased, with the US on March 26 adding a list of 5 organizations and 15 individual people to the list of those sanctioned for ""collaboration with Iran"". Clearly, the United States is interested in increasing and aggravating the crisis, not in reducing it.

Despite this, Iran has shown itself to be increasingly strong. Foreign sanctions, although cruel to the country's economy, have forced Iran to develop previously weaker sectors, strengthening the country as a whole. The Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, spoke in this regard, stating that “Iran has benefited from US sanctions. This made us self-sufficient in all areas”. Looking at it comparatively, the US, being the largest economy in the world, demonstrates a much greater strategic fragility, since the pandemic grows exponentially in its territory, even under conditions much more economically favorable than Iran.

Indeed, economic sanctions play a unique strategic role on the international scenario: generating instability and damaging the lives of the people affected by the measures. However, this seems to be a weak and inefficient formula when applied to strong and organically structured nations, with millennia of tradition and nurtured by great popular support for their governments, as is the case with the Islamic Republic of Iran. As Jeffrey Sachs, professor of sustainable development at Columbia University, wrote to Chinese media: “The US should immediately suspend all economic sanctions on countries that are struggling to deal with the disease (...) US economic sanctions have caused millions of people to suffer, and soon they could kill tens of thousands, if not far more. Exacerbating civilians' suffering to try to change their government's conduct is ethically wrong and prohibited by international law. Pursuing this strategy during the worst health crisis the world has faced in modern times demonstrates reckless disregard for human life and contempt for the norms of civilized behavior. ”

Finally, we must wait to see what will be the next steps of the US in its desperate search for the preservation of the global hegemony. If the American government is more interested in taking care of its own people and fighting the virus than punishing foreign nations, the most correct measure is an immediate end to sanctions."

Finally, a military pilot steps forward and completely blows the lid off the unlawful and exceedingly destructive Global Chemtrail Program. What follows is a video which puts forth a true story about a courageous pilot who has broken ranks with his chemtrailing peers. In so doing he has risked his life and the life of his family. As you listen to this presentation, or read the text provided below, bear in mind that chemtrails are being sprayed 24/7 around the globe with terrible consequences.

For those uninitiated in the ways of atmospheric engineering, chemtrails are but one geoengineering technique that is being systematically used by the U.S. Military. The following link provides an excellent overview of the geoengineering /chemtrail phenomenon, as well as an exceptional photo-doc. After all, only seeing is believing … for most people! CHEMTRAILS: A Planetary Catastrophe Created by Geoengineering (UPDATED) No matter what the stated reasons are given to those who fly the chemtrail jets, they are always told by their superiors that this ongoing and illegal atmosphere-altering program is being conducted in the interest of NATIONAL SECURITY. You’ll notice that NATIONAL SECURITY appears crooked because the whole intention behind geoengineering is as dangerously misguided as it is deceptively false. The indiscriminate, wide-area and systematic spraying of toxic aerosols throughout the skies of the world couldn’t possibly have anything to do with ‘national security’. Those that buy into such a ridiculous concept have obviously been either brainwashed or bribed into believing such a ridiculous notion.

That’s precisely why this unprecedented exposé is so important. Never before has anyone directly involved with the piloting of chemtrail airliners ever gone public. Not only does “Blue Jay 1?, as he is known, go public, he completely blows the lid off of OPERATION INDIGO SKYFOLD. This single act of identifying the name of what is perhaps the most destructive government program in recorded history is extremely critical.

Because it now gives the worldwide anti-geoengineering advocacy groups a target to hit within their own nations and governments. How, after all, could government officials and political leaders at every level — federal, state, county and city — be so clueless about a massive aerosol spraying program that is going on in the skies right above them?! Can any responsible representative continue to plead such ignorance or indifference and get away with it? That’s why this critical development is so huge! Really HUGE! It is what we have all been waiting for, yet so few in the movement really get it. Which is why this particular message has to be taken to the wider public.

The globalist sharks are circling America like a hungry Hammerhead since Trump allowed a cabal of Bill Gates’s minions in white coats to lock down the population and shut down the economy.

Doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, both of whom have received tens of millions of dollars from Bill Gates, walked into Trump’s office with models and projections from another Gates minion, British Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, and told him millions would die if he didn’t shut the country down…

Dr. Birx, whose medical license is expired, reviewed several models for this outbreak but presented disputed models and projections to Trump that were funded by Bill Gates!… Birx also sits on the board of a global foundation that has received $2 billion from Mr. Gates.

Dr. Fauci has received a $100 million grant from Bill Gates. The vaccine company he is pushing, “Moderna Therapeutics”, received $20 million from Mr. Gates in 2016. When you do a deep dive into this virus, Bill Gates is everywhere, including the Wuhan Bio-Lab, and every other Bio-Lab on the planet, which is why blaming China is a red herring.

The cat is out of the bag, Mr. President, Dr. Fauci is a rat! You need to investigate Bill Gates, stop having tea at the White House with his minions, and get a new team whose solutions don’t involve forced vaccines that include a quantum tattoo that will mark us with an invisible identifier. They are swiftly destroying our country!

Then, when you throw in the fact that 60% of the COVD-19 deaths have occurred in only 4 states, and that of the overall death toll, 60% were in nursing homes, and a recent Pentagon study showed that those who got a flu vaccine increased their risk of getting this virus by 36%, making this look more like a New World Order agenda than a reason to bankrupt a nation…"

Dershowitz’s remarks come after critics have attacked President Donald Trump for tweeting about matters related to the Department of Justice, which led to Attorney General William Barr publicly asking the president to stop last week.

“There was a lot of White House control of the Justice Department during the Kennedy administration and I don’t think we saw very many liberal professors arguing against that,” Dershowitz told Breitbart News. “I have some information as well about the Obama administration – which will be disclosed in a lawsuit at some point, but I’m not prepared to disclose it now – about how President Obama personally asked the FBI to investigate somebody on behalf of George Soros, who was a close ally of his.”

“We’ve seen this kind of White House influence on the Justice Department virtually in every Justice Department,” Dershowitz continued. “The difference this president is much more overt about it, he tweets about it. President Obama whispered to the Justice Department about it.”

“You said that George Soros asked Barack Obama to have his Justice Department investigate somebody?” Breitbart News pressed.

“That’s going to come out in a lawsuit in the near future, yeah,” Dershowitz responded. “I have in my possession the actual 302 form which documents this issue and it will at the right time come out, but I’m not free to disclose it now because it’s a case that’s not yet been filed.”"

A legitimate bombshell of a story exploded this week when a female 2014 Democratic candidate for Nevada lieutenant governor spilled the beans about an episode she had with “Creepy” Joe Biden, who was, at the time, still vice president of the United States.

Writing in The Cut, Lucy Flores claimed that when Biden showed up in her state for a campaign event on her behalf, he behaved like…Biden:

As I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?”

I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual f**k? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.

Flores claims she was “embarrassed,” “shocked,” and “confused” by the overt sexual affront, but for some reason, she waited until now, as Biden considers a 2020 presidential run, to bring this up. We’ll leave it up to you to decide what her motivations are/were.

Interestingly, and this goes to the political intrigue about Flores’ motivations because they are both Democrats, the mainstream media is picking up on the story as well. That’s really odd because Biden has been “Creepy Joe Biden” for years, as the independent media have reported.

In fact, if you do a search for “creepy joe biden” videos you’re going to come up with compilation after compilation; some are funny, some are sick, some are both, but all prove that Biden’s been a creep for decades, not just in 2014. (Related: Joe Biden pulls a George Bush Senior, calls for ‘new world order’ during speech.)

As Jim Treacher writes at PJ Media regarding Democrats’ sudden interest/shock/disgust at Biden’s behavior:

It’s odd how a person’s bad behavior can be common knowledge for decades, and then suddenly it becomes an issue. Bill Cosby’s treatment of women was an open secret for decades, until comedian Hannibal Buress talked about it in his stand-up act. For whatever reason, that got the ball rolling. Now Cosby is in jail. He didn’t change. The world around him changed.

No big deal because Biden’s just a ‘gregarious guy’

Enter what’s going on with Biden all of a sudden. Treacher, like so many Democrats, have come out and said clearly that they believe Flores. Democrats are all into the #BelieveWomen campaign, perhaps, but Treacher says he buys the story because he knows Biden and, as we’ve stated, Biden’s been a creep for decades (and the Washington Beltway establishment has known it; he’s gotten a pass, however, because he was an Obama ally and water-carrying Dem).

Biden does the creep act — with young women, older women, kids — so often, in fact, that it was expected. There’s even one clip online showing former U.S. senator and attorney general Jeff Sessions swatting Biden’s hand away from a young girl:

But in the past, the fake news media has blown off Biden’s behavior as “gregarious,” “going off script,” acting “too jolly,” etc.

That’s how the Today Show reported Biden’s behavior at a Christmas party in 2013 when he was essentially grabbing a woman’s breasts while he stood behind her:

“He’s a gregarious guy. It doesn’t seem all that inappropriate to me but I don’t know what the moment was,” said former host Matt Lauer.

You remember Lauer, right? He was the guy who was fired from that show for being too sexually “gregarious.”

Biden is a creep, straight up. He’s always been one and, if Democrats nominate him as their 2020 presidential candidate, he’ll continue to be creepy."

Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) — Japan’s economy, the world’s second largest, entered its first recession since 2001 last quarter and the government and economists say conditions may get even worse.

Gross domestic product shrank an annualized 0.4 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo. Economists predicted the economy would grow 0.1 percent after contracting a revised 3.7 percent in the previous period.

The slowdown may deepen as the global financial crisis hurts exports, prompting companies from Toyota Motor Corp. to Canon Inc. to slash profit forecasts and cut investments. Japan has the lowest interest rates among the 20 biggest economies and public debt that exceeds 180 percent of GDP, limiting the government’s ability to stimulate growth.

“It’s only going to get worse,” said Masamichi Adachi, senior economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo. “Japan may be entering its deepest recession in a decade as the global financial crisis cools demand overseas.”

The Nikkei 225 Stock Average closed 0.7 percent higher, reversing declines of as much as 2.9 percent, as investors bought shares of drug and utilities companies, which are less vulnerable to a slowdown. The gauge has lost 43 percent this year. The yield on Japan’s 10-year bond fell two basis points to 1.48 percent.

The yen fell to 97.21 per dollar as of 4:16 p.m. in Tokyo from 96.09 before the report as a stock-market rally across Asia prompted investors to fund purchases of higher-yielding overseas assets in the Japanese currency. The yen has gained 9.2 percent since the end of September, compounding exporters’ woes.

The economy last contracted over two consecutive quarters — the technical definition of a recession — in 2001. Germany also fell into a recession last quarter, as did the entire euro zone, reports showed last week, and the U.S. is probably in one also.

“There is more bad news to come in the next few quarters as the global downturn hits hard,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics Ltd. in London.

Leaders from the Group of 20 nations this weekend agreed to take a “broader policy response” by using interest-rate cuts and fiscal stimulus to shore up the weakening global economy. The Bank of Japan has little scope to contribute further after lowering the benchmark rate to 0.3 percent last month, and a 5 trillion yen ($52 billion) stimulus plan announced by Prime Minister Taro Aso last month risks worsening the public debt.

Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Kaoru Yosano confirmed that the economy had entered a recession that may deepen.

“Given that the global economy is decelerating, Japan’s downturn will continue,” Yosano said. He said there’s a risk that that the slump will become “more severe” because the global financial crisis is spreading to emerging economies.

Growth in China, which became Japan’s biggest customer in July, slowed to 9 percent last quarter, the weakest since 2003.

Quarter-on-quarter, Japan’s economy shrank 0.1 percent, today’s report showed. Capital spending fell 1.7 percent from the previous three months, compared with economists’ expectations of a 2 percent drop.

Toyota, which makes more than three-quarters of its sales abroad, forecast profit will fall this fiscal year by almost 70 percent. The carmaker will fire 3,000 workers by March, and the Nikkei newspaper reported this month that it will delay adding capacity at a domestic plant that makes Lexus sedans.

Canon, the world’s largest camera maker, last month forecast profit growth would fall for the first time in nine years and said it will cut capital spending 4.7 percent in 2008 to 410 billion yen.

“The economy is still so sensitive to the global business cycle,” said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Tokyo. “A long as the global economy keeps sinking, Japan will probably experience a deep recession.”

Net exports subtracted 0.2 percentage point from growth after imports outweighed an increase in shipments abroad. Exports rose 0.7 percent, less than the 1.2 percent expected. Imports climbed 1.9 percent as oil surged to a record in the quarter. Economists predicted a 1.5 percent gain.

Still, Japan will probably suffer less than its biggest counterparts after companies shed debt and streamlined labor forces following the bursting of the property and asset bubble in the early 1990s. Asia’s biggest economy will shrink 0.1 percent next year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, less than the 0.9 percent and 0.5 percent contractions in the U.S. and Europe.

Consumers are getting some relief as inflation abates and the government prepares to provide households with at least 12,000 yen ($125) each as part of the stimulus plan. Consumer spending increased 0.3 percent last quarter, more than the 0.1 percent economists expected, today’s report showed.

“It’s difficult to take it as a good sign because the figure was boosted by seasonal factors such as the hot summer and the Olympics,” said Junko Nishioka, an economist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “Consumption will probably turn negative in the fourth quarter” and the economy won’t recover until 2010, she said.

The ratio of jobs to applicants has fallen for eight months and the deteriorating profit outlook for companies is also putting pressure on wages. Winter bonuses, which typically account for about 10 percent of a fulltime worker’s annual pay, will fall 2.9 percent this year, the Nikkei reported last week.

This secrecy supports the notion of a conspiracy.","US electronic surveillance in Mexico reportedly targeted top officials, including both current and previous presidents. Intelligence produced by the NSA helped Americans get an upper hand in diplomatic talks and find good investment opportunities. The US National Security Agency was apparently very happy with its successes in America’s southern neighbor, according to classified documents leaked by Edward Snowden and analyzed by the German magazine, Der Spiegel. It reports on new details of the spying on the Mexican government, which dates back at least several years.

The fact that Mexican President Peña Nieto is of interest to the NSA was revealed earlier by Brazilian TV Globo, which also had access to the documents provided by Snowden. Spiegel says his predecessor Felipe Calderon was a target too, and the Americans hacked into his public email back in May 2010.

The access to Calderon electronic exchanges gave the US spies “diplomatic, economic and leadership communications which continue to provide insight into Mexico’s political system and internal stability,” the magazine cites an NSA top secret internal report as saying. The operation to hack into presidential email account was dubbed “Flatliquid” by the American e-spooks.

The bitter irony of the situation is that Calderon during his term in office worked more closely with Washington than any other Mexican president before him. In 2007 he even authorized the creation of a secret facility for electronic surveillance, according to a July publication in the Mexican newspaper, Excelsior.

The surveillance on President Nieto started when he was campaigning for office in the early summer of 2012, the report goes on. The NSA targeted his phone and the phones of nine of his close associates to build a map of their regular contacts. From then it closely monitored those individuals’ phones as well, intercepting 85,489 text messages, including those sent by Nieto.

After the Globo TV report, which mentioned spying on Mexico only in passing, Nieto stated that US President Barack Obama had promised him to investigate the accusations and to punish those responsible of any misconduct. The reaction was far milder than that from Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff, another target of NSA’s intensive interest, who has since canceled a planned trip to the US and delivered a withering speech at the UN General Assembly, which condemned American electronic surveillance.

Another NSA operation in Mexico dubbed “Whitetamale” allowed the agency to gain access to emails of high-ranking officials in country’s Public Security Secretariat, a law enforcement body that combats drug cartels and human trafficking rings. The hacking, which happened in August 2009, gave the US information about Mexican crime fighting, but also provided access to “diplomatic talking-points,” an internal NSA document says.

In a single year, this operation produced 260 classified reports that facilitated talks on political issues and helped the Americans plan international investments.

“These TAO [Tailored Access Operations – an NSA division that handles missions like hacking presidential emails] accesses into several Mexican government agencies are just the beginning – we intend to go much further against this important target,” the document reads. It praises the operation as a “tremendous success” and states that the divisions responsible for this surveillance are “poised for future successes.”

Economic espionage is a motive for NSA spying, which the agency vocally denied, but which appears in the previous leaks. The agency had spied on the Brazilian oil giant, Petrobras, according to earlier revelations. This combined with reports that the NSA hacked into the email of Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff, triggered a serious deterioration of relations between the two countries.

While the NSA declined comment to the German magazine, the Mexican Foreign Ministry replied with an email, which condemned any form of espionage on Mexican citizens. The NSA presumably could read that email at the same time as the journalists, Der Spiegel joked.

The Mexican Foreign Ministry issued a statement reproaching the US for its alleged actions. “This practice is unacceptable, illegal and against Mexican and international law,” the statement said.

The ministry stated that Obama promised to carry out an “exhaustive investigation” to determine who is behind the suspected surveillance. “In a relationship between neighbors and partners there is no place for the actions that allegedly took place.”"

What has happened to the world’s premier law enforcement and anti-terrorism agency? Have all of its leaders lost their minds or, more likely, have they become so politicized and infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome they can no longer think clearly and rationally?

These are legitimate questions given the contents of an internal FBI document revealed last week by Yahoo News.

According to an analysis of the report by The Gateway Pundit, it appears as though elements within the bureau have not only made some inherently questionable speculative allegations, but the sources cited as the basis for at least some of them are not only suspicious but outright comical.

The crux of the FBI report, which originated in the Phoenix office, according to Yahoo News, warns that “conspiracy theorists” who discuss the “Deep State” are a new, emerging domestic terrorist threat.

Furthermore, one of the conspiracies identified as problematic in the report is the belief that a deep state plot existed — or continues to exist — to oust POTUS Donald Trump from office.

Now, based on at least two years’ worth of reporting, mostly by the independent media but not exclusively so, rational Americans understand and know that a) “Spygate” is a real thing; b) it was launched by the Obama administration; and c) the objective, clearly, was to drive POTUS Trump out of office.

But beyond that, sources for the report’s conclusions included the far-Left ‘fact-checking’ site Snopes and Wikipedia, the latter of which is banned as a student reference source by most colleges and universities because it is biased, non-objective, and often incorrect.

Notes Twitter user Rosie memos: “Wow. The @FBI has yet to say a word about ANTIFA but the Arizona office is tiptoeing around calling conspiracy theorists, domestic terrorists. They cite Qanon, Sandy Hook, Pizzagate and Islamberg.”

“Shockingly their citations are WIKIPEDIA and SNOPES? Are you kidding @FBI @TheJusticeDept are these really your sources? Is there no one in the intelligence community that understands wiki can be edited by anyone and Snopes is owned by a sexual predator couple?”

The FBI also wants to monitor your social media accounts

As you can see in the tweets, the sources are plainly listed: Snopes. Wikipedia.

This, from Connors State College, regarding the unreliability of Wikipedia as an academic source: “Wikipedia is increasingly used by people in the academic community, from first-year students to professors, as the easiest source of information about anything and everything. However, citation of Wikipedia in research papers may not be considered acceptable, because Wikipedia is not a creditable source.”

You know who else says that Wikipedia isn’t a reliable source? Wikipedia, as noted at this link.

Snopes is equally unreliable and often false — motivated by political bias rather than facts, as Natural News has reported.

But hey, to the FBI, these are now bona fide reliable sources. (Related: Are Unrecorded FBI Interviews a G-Man’s License to Lie?)

No wonder fewer and fewer Americans trust this agency.

There’s more, however, and it’s something that Director Christopher Wray should have to answer for.

As The Gateway Pundit revealed, the bureau wants to develop or purchase an off-the-shelf “social media early alerting tool” so that agents can monitor social media in real time, just like what happens in China, Cuba, Venezuela and, increasingly, Russia.

“With increased use of social media platforms by subjects of current FBI investigations and individuals that pose a threat to the United States, it is critical to obtain a service which will allow the FBI to identify relevant information from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other Social media platforms in a timely fashion,” the FBI said in a recent proposal that’s been updated.

“Consequently, the FBI needs near real-time access to a full range of social media exchanges in order to obtain the most current information available in furtherance of its law enforcement and intelligence missions,” it says.

Anyone who isn’t backing POTUS Trump’s efforts to ‘drain the swamp’ after all that has happened to him is part of the problem."

Eggers explains, “I think it’s certainly increasingly difficult for Democrats to make the claim there is no evidence of voter fraud. In this book, we had 40 pages of footnotes . . . so, there is quite a bit of evidence. As recent events have shown, it doesn’t take voter fraud on massive or national level for it to truly impact elections. . . . In the 2016 election, we found 2,100 incidents of double voting in the state of Florida alone.”

Another nationwide statistic that reveals voting fraud is more registered voters than eligible voters in nearly 250 counties. Eggers says, “We have 248 counties in this country that have more registered voters than they have citizens of legal voting age. How does that happen? There are clearly errors on the voter rolls. This is why the subtitle of the book is ‘How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election’ because what I uncover in the book is George Soros and the head of the Democrat Party both support the effort to do two things. On one hand, they fight any effort to increase the legality and security of elections in this country. They do that by fighting state efforts to institute voter ID laws or to cleanse the voter rolls of illegal voters. That’s documented and not up for dispute. The State of Ohio just successfully fought George Soros to do both those things. They also fund groups like La Raza and ACORN, and they have had to change their names because they are chronically associated with voter fraud allegations. So, those guys go out and get as many voters as possible, regardless of whether they should be casting votes in this country. Then they funnel them through the gaps that exist in our vulnerable election system. That’s basically the set up.”

Eggers goes on to say, “I think there is clear evidence that they (Democrats) are actively working to create an environment that makes cheating as possible and as likely as it can be. Let’s put it this way, what Democrats have actively pursued charges of voting fraud?

In closing, Eggers says, “The good news is we do have a president like President Trump that is laser focused on the issue, and he is informing quite a few people. . . . The sanctity and security of our elections is absolutely a national security issue.”

Billy Graham is sadly honored by many Americans as a man of God. He may be a great man in the eyes of the world, but he's certainly NOT God's man. Billy Graham has gone the greedy way of Balaam, a prophet-for-hire, and is the pioneer of today's apostate ecumenical movement. The following quote is from the article, Billy Graham is a Great Deceiver!:

Earlier, at a news conference, the famed evangelist thrilled the cockles of the homosexuals' lusty hearts when he snapped to a reporter that he was tired of people trying to get him to criticize gays. ""It's not the biggest of sins,"" Graham said. Billy followed this up by telling the smiling and happy liberal media: ""What I want to preach about in San Francisco is the love of God. People need to know that God loves them no matter what their sexual orientation."" Graham also proudly confided: ""I have so many gay friends, and we remain friends.""

Let me repeat what Billy graham said... ""I have so many gay friends, and we remain friends."" Befriending sinners with the Gospel is one thing, but condoning their sins is another. Billy Graham is the founder of ChristianityToday, which has directed teens curious about their sexuality to pro-homosexual websites. The issue is not about judging people; but rather, taking a Biblical stand against the Homosexual Agenda.

2nd Corinthians 6:14 states, ""Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?"" Billy Graham is wrong to diminish the sin of homosexuality. Billy Sunday never would have gone soft on booze, dancing, or gambling! Instead of boasting of his homosexual friends and supporting the homosexual cause; Mr. Graham should be preaching uncompromisingly against the woeful sin of homosexuality! Graham is no better than Martin Luther King Jr., a perverted Communist who denied the deity of Christ. The root of America's ills is its apostate church leaders.

I don't condemn anyone, for that is not my place. God is the only Law Giver and Judge. I am simply taking a stand for the Word of God. I am a hell-deserving sinner as much as Billy Graham or anyone else. My intent is not to criticize or defame, God forbid; but rather, to uphold the Scriptural teaching that homosexuality is a sin. Jesus came to save homosexuals, not condemn them (John 3:17). I have nothing against Billy Graham personally. What I do expose is Billy Graham's ecumenical ministry of compromise, his unscriptural alliance with the Catholic Church and his apostate magazine ChristianityToday.

Billy Graham has also been identified as a 33rd degree occult Freemason. Charles Taze Russell—founder of the Jehovah's Witnesses--was a 33rd Degree Freemason, as was Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormons. Jesse Jackson is a 33rd degree Freemason as well. Birds of a feather flock together! Did you know that Southern Baptist Convention church members compose 37% of the occult Freemasonry membership in the U.S.? That's apostasy! Please read: Freemasonry's ""Great Architect"" is Satan! No Christian should ever join or befriend Freemasonry.

I knew a pastor, who appointed a Freemason as the president of his church board of directors. It is apostasy! That same neo-evangelical pastor was eventually invited by the local Freemasonry lodge, to attend a special meeting in his honor. He accepted the invitation. By going down to the Freemasonry lodge, he gave approval of their demonic organization. The root of America's ills are its apostate church leaders. END"

Tensions continue to be high in the Ukraine crisis. The U.S. is continually beefing up supplies and help to Eastern Europe. There are military drills happening on land and in the air with NATO. Likewise, the same type of drills are happening with Russian military. Iraq is a mess with gains being made by ISIS and counter attacks by the Iraqi military and Shia militia. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said the Iraqis outnumber ISIS but “lack the will to fight.” Military sources said, this past week, that Iraqi forces were “not driven out” of Ramadi, but they just “drove out” of that town on their own. Now, a new offensive is taking shape to take back Ramadi. President Obama is not planning on sending troops but will train and fly support missions. The support bombing missions are sparse and some say are a joke. We see how well the Obama Administration strategy has worked so far. It’s a disaster.

The big future war probability, that isn’t getting much coverage, is China. The South China Sea is supposed to be international waters, but China is now claiming a large chunk of it. That country is building islands, lighthouses and future military bases on them. The Chinese themselves say these Islands are for military purposes. They are building bases with long runways, and this is a way for China to project power. It should worry anyone with a brain. The Chinese claim the US is causing “provocations and instigations.” The Pentagon says it will keep sending ships and surveillance aircraft into the South China Sea. Can a military conflict be far off?

President Obama’s immigration policy that would allow 5 million illegal immigrants to stay in America and receive benefits took another body blow. A Federal appeals court upheld the blocking of Obamas immigration amnesty that was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge earlier this year. This is a pie in the face for Mr. “pen and phone.” This ruling is going to be very hard to overturn in the next appeal, but who knows what the President will continue to do on his own.

Goldman Sachs is warning the world is drowning in debt. It is outright warning of another financial calamity that could be caused by a “liquidity crisis” and “ballooning debt.” Multiple countries around the world have debt to GDP ratios near or more than 100%. The USA is just over 100%. History shows that when countries have more debt than GDP, bad things happen to the economy–like it can implode. I thought we had a “recovery”? The fact is we don’t have a recovery, and banks like Goldman Sachs don’t want to lose credibility, so they are putting out warnings. Gregory Mannarino thinks this is a real warning, and Goldman does not want to miss the next meltdown and take a big hit to their waning credibility. There are plenty of catalysts to cause a crash, and one is a Greek debt default. The time is running out for the Greek game, and there may be a conclusion as soon as the Greeks are running out of ways to borrow money to pay debts. The other is a war that goes regional or global, and the three top hot spots are Russia, China and the Middle East. Big wars in any of those places could touch off a financial calamity worse than 2008. It’s worse because the debt in the world is much greater. As I always say, “We have been told that debt (Federal Reserve Note) is money and debt (bonds) is an asset. We are going to find out neither is true. Debt is always a liability.” The world is chocked full of liabilities.

Comment from Carl:

 



As most of your readers know, the majority of these people are not Christian, and neither are their colleagues. They invert Christian morality and debauch women and men, children, some of them very plain looking girls (Lewinsky). When one of them is desperate for a distraction from say, à war in Kosovo. Or perhaps another black role model reducing their image to that of an animal on schedule.



As you know Henry, since everyone in the club is blackmailed, if they step out of favor, or don't follow the plan, something leaks out on purpose. 

George Bush senior was busted by a major newspaper for hiring male underage call boys. He has not been outed because he has been a good boy, followed his masters.

The true agenda behind the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic becomes more apparent by the day, including with the recent announcement by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that public schools in the Empire State will be handed over to Bill and Melinda Gates once the lockdowns end.

Describing the pre-pandemic public school system as the “old model,” Cuomo told reporters during a news conference at Upstate Medical University in Syracuse that “remote learning” through apps like Zoom will become a permanent way of life for students in New York, long after the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis ends.

“The old model of everybody goes and sits in a classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom and teaches that class and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms – why?” he asked. “With all the technology you have?”

Stopping short of saying that all existing public school buildings will remain closed forever after the pandemic ends, Cuomo did reveal that his state is now “exploring” all of the ways that “distance learning” can remain a permanent fixture under his New World Order vision post-pandemic.

Back in March when Cuomo first closed all New York public schools, the narrative was that the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) needed to slow to the point that hospitals would not be overwhelmed, also known as “flattening the curve.” But the goal posts have since moved, much like they have all across the country, as the true intent of keeping things closed forever and switching to an all-digital society seems to be coming into full view.

“It’s hard to change the status quo,” Cuomo lamented, clearly irritated that many people will not appreciate having all of society permanently changed because of a virus. “But you get moments in history where people say, ‘okay, I’m ready for change. I get it.’ I think this is one of those moments.”

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how to deal with the five stages of coronavirus grief:

Bill and Melinda Gates to “design blueprint” for post-pandemic education in New York

Basically admitting that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is being used to force New York – and the rest of the world, for that matter – into the New World Order, Cuomo outlined how things will change as his state transitions out of lockdown and into the “new normal.”

Along with keeping children at home basically forever, technology will replace pretty much all of the old methods of teaching and learning that required actual human interaction. Teachers will stay in their homes and teach children through screens, and “ongoing social distancing rules” when children do meet in actual buildings will be perpetuated.

Eugenicists Bill and Melinda Gates will also be given the keys to “design a blueprint for post-pandemic education in New York,” Cuomo revealed, which more than likely means that all children will be forcibly vaccinated and given mark of the beast quantum dot tattoos as part of their reentry back into the educational system.

During this transitionary period, all public schools in New York will remain closed throughout the rest of the schoolyear. This will create the time necessary for Cuomo and Bill and Melinda Gates to transition everything from the old way of doing things to the new, after which there will be no going back – which seems to have been the plan all along.

Rubino says, “The next recession is overdue because this is the longest expansion on record. . . . We loaded up car buyers with sub-prime loans. Students now have $1.5 trillion of student debt. Credit card debt is at record levels. Government debt is at record levels. Corporate debt is at record levels. . . . All of these guys have borrowed more money than they ever have in history. So, the idea we are going to convince people to borrow a lot more money by lowering interest rates is at best problematic and at worst insane. We are headed that way because they have no other tools. So, when things slow down, they are going to start cutting again and printing money and buying up assets with that money. We’ll see if it works again. It shouldn’t have worked the last time. . . . We are in a range of unexplored numbers. . . . How much further can this go? Is there a limit out there? We are going to find out in the next recession.”

Rubino is not impressed with the Federal Reserve’s latest promise to slash interest rates and print money to save a teetering economy. Rubino contends, “The markets ought to be terrified by this, but in the U.S. because the rates are not yet zero, the market is not yet terrified. We are not far from 0%. . . . The Fed can’t save us. We’re at the point now where we would be at a 1930’s style depression or a Weimar Germany hyperinflation or something new and equally bad. We have taken on insane amounts of debt, more than any society in history has ever tried to take on. So, we just don’t know what is going to happen. If the central banks cannot stop the next recession, we will find out what happens when this much debt goes bad. . . . The Fed’s biggest fear is that things will spin out of control, and they won’t have the tools to stop it.”

On gold and silver, Rubino warns, “Pretty much the only way out for central banks is they will have to devalue their currency aggressively to keep the debts from blowing up on us and completely destroying the financial system. That is a great environment for gold. It will become more and more apparent to people going forward. . . . As you add to your position (in gold and silver), the big trend will be positive for you. . . . Debt is continuing to soar . . . and that is continuing and accelerating right now. So, if the big bad trend is accelerating, then the big bad result of that trend is getting closer and closer, but timing is impossible to predict. . . . When this thing really begins to spin out of control, it’s too late to protect yourself. . . .You really hope you don’t end up in a world where gold is $10,000 per ounce because that is a bad world in a lot of ways. If that is no longer just a possibility but a probability, you need to protect yourself in some way. That’s what precious metals do.”

Although suddenly everyone is aware of the looming financial collapse of the State of Illinois, almost no one is aware of why it’s actually happening. And the lying mainstream media — purveyors of fake news — won’t dare tell you the real truth: Illinois is being bankrupted by Big Pharma and the failed “sick care” medical establishment.

With a current payables backlog of $15 billion it owes to contractors that include “sick care” providers, Illinois also owes $251 billion in future pension benefits that include health care coverage. That’s a quarter of a trillion dollars for a state that is so far beyond broke that even mainstream news organizations are calling its financial situation “catastrophic.”

On top of that, a recent court ruling demands the state now pay $586 million per month to catch up on all the unpaid Medicaid bills it owes doctors, hospitals, cancer clinics and drug companies. State comptroller Susana Mendoza says, “Friday’s ruling would cause her to likely have to cut payments to the state’s pension funds, state payroll or payments to local governments,” according to the Chicago Tribune. “As if the governor and legislators needed any more reason to compromise and settle on a comprehensive budget plan immediately, Friday’s ruling by the U.S. District Court takes the state’s finances from horrific to catastrophic,” said Mendoza.

Like all the other states, Illinois has flushed billions down the toilet to enrich Big Pharma’s failed “sick care” treatments

The real reason Illinois is going broke is because the health care system in America is technically a legal drug cartel … a profiteering monopoly that transfers economic wealth from the citizens to the pockets of drug companies.

A literal conspiracy across the FDA and state medical boards criminalizes natural medicine while pushing high-priced prescription drugs that cure nothing and only guarantee repeat business for the pharma drug cartels. The result is a massive, nationwide “wealth extraction” operation run by the drug companies, and Illinois is just the first of many states that will financially crumble under the burden of monopoly-priced medicine that fails to prevent disease in the first place.

Even as we’re watching Illinois implode under the financial burden of a failed health care system, almost no one is talking about the real source of the problem: The drug cartels and their monopoly over medicine. In the same way that Colombia was transformed into a “narco state” in the 1980s by the lucrative cocaine trade cocaine, today’s United States of America has collapsed into a “pharma state” where drug company interests dominate the politics.

To save America, we must declare independence from Big Pharma’s drug cartels

America spends almost one out of every four dollars of its GDP on “sick care” services. This is largely money that’s spent on a broken health care system dominated by Big Pharma’s toxic drugs that simply don’t work to prevent sickness and disease. This disastrous drug cartel serves only to transfer wealth from the population to the pockets of drug company shareholders and CEOs, and if America is to financially survive, it must reject this failed system of unaffordable, toxic medicine.

The FDA’s federally-enforced drug monopoly must end, and we as a nation must legalize natural medicine for everyone, including protecting doctors and health practitioners who wish to prescribe natural medicine to their patients (but will currently lose their medical licenses if they attempt such things).

The primary enforcer of the toxic pharmaceutical cartels that are bankrupting America — the FDA — must be gutted from top to bottom. The agency serves as nothing but a drug-pushing protection racket enforcer, targeting natural medicine manufacturers for destruction while colluding with drug companies to keep dangerous, costly prescription medications widely available even when they are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. Thanks to the FDA, for example, prescription opioid deaths have now surpassed all gun-related deaths in America. The result is the acceleration toward bankruptcy at every level of our economy: Cities, states and even nations are facing imminent financial collapse because they’ve spent fortunes on monopoly-priced medications that have accomplished nothing other than enriching the Big Pharma drug cartel.

When a single state in America must now pay over half a billion dollars per month just to barely keep up with what it owes the medical system, you know something has gone terribly wrong and the system is unsustainable.

Big Pharma is a dangerous parasite on the U.S. economy and it will bankrupt everything if we don’t stop it. All the Republican talk about health care reform and “free market” solutions is just smoke and mirrors unless you address the pharma drug cartels and the FDA-enforced monopoly that criminalizes natural medicine, a safe, affordable and highly effective alternative to toxic prescription medications.

In fact, I’ll make a bold prediction here: Any state or nation that does not free itself from the economic death grip of the pharma drug cartels will eventually face financial collapse. Paying more and more money to a monopoly-protected corporate monstrosity that sells toxic chemicals to sick people is not merely unsustainable, it is stupid beyond belief. Yet this remains the default plan of both Republicans and Democrats in Washington, nearly all of whom are prostitutes for the pharmaceutical industry.

In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times, the progressive billionaire predicted that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will become the Democratic nominee who will face Trump in 2020.

“She has emerged as the clear-cut person to beat,” he said. “I don’t take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.”

Soros quickly added that his comments were not an endorsement of Warren, saying “I’m not endorsing anybody because I want to work with whoever, ” adding “I don’t express my views generally because I have to live with whoever the electorate chooses.”

When the Times’ Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed out that the ultra-wealthy, including his Wall St. peers think Warren’s taxation of the rich and tight regulatory plans for banks would be a giant threat to the “capitalistic system in which he made his riches,” Soros said he disagreed – reiterating his support of a wealth tax.

Martenson says, “Our prediction at PeakProsperity.com is these collapse trends, we have been following for 10 years now, are accelerating and continuing. None of them are reversing at this point in time. These will impact people’s future in a huge way. Environmentally, we see these signs, but we also have $245 trillion of debt in the global economy. We have been accelerating that debt cycle as if we could just keep that trend going forever—we can’t. So, what we see are all these unsustainable trends converging. They are going to happen . . . and people need to be ready.”

Martenson lays out the case to blame central banks for much of the geopolitical and economic friction in the world today. Martenson says, “The economic pie is not expanding anymore. It’s kind of stagnant. So, if you have one tiny group taking their fair share and the pie isn’t growing, it means they are taking from somebody else. This is the essence of central banking. They don’t create wealth, they redistribute wealth. When the Federal Reserve crams rates to zero, the savers lose out, but lose to who? The winners and losers are being picked by the central banks, and they have decided that the .01% should be the winners in this story and everybody else should be the losers. . . . Central bank policies have really benefited the elites at the expense of everybody else. This brings up the most important point and that is central banks are not our friends. They are redistributive organizations.”

Martenson also says, “Our view is if we get into a war that it will be so devastating, there really won’t be a recovery from it.” As for the elite, Martenson says, “It’s time to panic. . . . They have thrown in the towel, they have caved and are ready to go back to the print-a-thon thing. That is concerning because the financial world can’t even manage stopping their bond purchases, let alone reversing them without them panicking . . . . When a central bank can’t even flatten out their balance sheet purchases, you should be panicking.”

Central banks cannot stop the money printing without the whole system blowing up. Maybe that is why gold is going up? Martenson says, “I believe it is. . . . I buy gold because gold is the only form of money that is not simultaneously someone else’s liability. We are talking about a world so saddled with debt, I am not sure where all the liabilities lie. I don’t trust . . . the accounting of major corporations. I don’t trust what derivatives will do in a crisis. . . . This is the ‘Everything Bubble.’ What happens when it bursts? We don’t know. So, gold, to me, is the thing I want to own and hold when you have a systemic crisis.”

Earthquakes, famine, war, persecution and plagues were all predicted by Jesus Christ in the “End of Days.” Quayle says, “Let’s just take the locust plague. It was the ninth plague of ancient Egypt. The locust plague now that is infecting, eating and devouring Africa and the Middle East, and it’s gone into China. . . . It’s eating its way across Asia. . . . The overview is when Jesus spoke about ‘wars and rumors of wars,’ he also talked about famine. He talked about pestilence. He talked about betrayal. He talked about people who will be persecuted, and people are being persecuted and murdered all over the world who are Christians. It’s now coming to the United States. So, there is a global persecution going on now.”

Quayle goes on to say, “In order to bring about the New World Order, they have to absolutely destroy the old world order. They want no nationalism. They don’t want national identity. They don’t want individual borders, language or culture. They don’t want individual currency. They don’t want anybody that can think outside the official global mindset. Star Trek called it the ‘Borg.’ There is a word I have come up with, ‘Borgicated.’ We’ve all been Borgicated.”

When it comes to the economy, Quayle says, “So, now we are seeing an economic morass, upheaval and tumult. The best term to describe that is convulsion economics, or another word I made up, ‘convulsinomics.’ When someone goes into convulsions, it is something that is beyond their control. There are involuntary responses taking place. We have economics in convulsion. There is no true price discovery. There are only manipulations. . . . The ‘D’ word, debt and the basis of debt, and debt and death go hand in hand. The reckless abandonment of all the world now, it’s seriously just print, print, print, print, print. This is why the metals (gold and silver) will explode.”

What should people do? Quayle says, “God can protect. Jesus says he’s a Good Shepherd and his sheep hear his voice, but there are so many false shepherds out there trying to steal the sheep. . . . I find all answers and solutions are in the Word of God.”

In closing, Quayle says, “In the coming days, the two most precious commodities will be fresh water and edible food. It may not be what you are used to, but edible food. . . . When you see the major volcanos of the world going off simultaneously and cannibalism filling the headlines, know that we are entering into Tribulation times.”

“It’s time to remind the British government what you did with Saddam Hussein will not forget. And we are ready to sacrifice with everything, as not to give up Iraq and stay alert for the coming,” a message included in a graphic showing a large banner of Hussein declares in broken English.

The alleged hack arrives three days after The Washington Post ran an article alleging the Islamic State is controlled by former Saddam Hussein loyalists and Baathists.

The U.S. made a similar accusation in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq when neocons in the Pentagon and the Bush administration insisted Saddam Hussein was working with al-Qaeda. This claim was subsequently debunked as war propaganda. “We could never verify that there was any Iraqi authority, direction and control, complicity with al-Qaeda for 9/11 or any operational act against America, period,” the former director of the CIA, George Tenet, told 60 Minutes in 2007.

In October, the Anti-Defamation League claimed the Moroccan Islamic Union-Mail was hacking for ISIS following an attack on the Mass­a­chu­setts Mar­itime Academy’s website. The group was said to be responsible for hacking the Con­gre­ga­tion Beth Am Israel in Penn Val­ley, Pennsylvania in July.

“After focusing on Israeli targets during the aggression on Gaza, the Moroccan Islamic Union-mail declares tar­get­ing impor­tant web­sites in Amer­ica in sup­port of the Iraqi peo­ple and in response to the Amer­i­can airstrikes,” the group posted to its Facebook.

The Facebook page hosted a photo showing alleged members of MIUM displaying hand signals similiar to those used by American gangs. The image has since been replaced by the group’s logo.

A concerted effort to blame Iraqi Baathists for the violent escapades of ISIS is now underway. The effort is apparently a response to a body of evidence revealing the terrorist army is in fact a creation of intelligence organizations, primarily the CIA which has a long track record in manufacturing terrorist groups. Saudi Arabia, which now claims to be a target of ISIS, is also responsible for funding the group.

Five new revelations in the Russian uranium case

Evidence gathered by an FBI undercover informant conflicts with several media reports as well as statements by Justice Department officials concerning the connections between a Russian nuclear bribery case and the Obama administration’s approval of the sale of Uranium One to Russia’s state-owned Rosatom nuclear company. Here are five revelations from those documents reviewed by The Hill.

Marc Thiessen: Yes, the Clintons should be investigated

Ever since Watergate, the mantra of all major corruption investigations has been to “follow the money.” Well, Americans of all political stripes should be outraged by the fact that both Democrats and Republicans in Washington are up to their eyeballs in Kremlin cash. Russian money found its way into the pockets of not only Trump advisers like Paul Manafort and Rick Gates — who were recently indicted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III — but also Democratic power lobbyist Tony Podesta, Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.

A federal judge has denied a request for a new trial by former U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, who was found guilty of taking money from a sham charity that was purported to be aiding poor students. The 70-year-old Ms. Brown was convicted of taking money from the One Door for Education Foundation and lying on her taxes and congressional financial-disclosure forms.

Houston attorney and top Democratic donor Steve Mostyn has died. He was 46. The Mostyn Law Firm said in a prepared statement that he ended his life Wednesday. His wife, Amber Mostyn, told The Texas Tribune that he died after “a sudden onset and battle with a mental health issue.” “Steve was a beloved husband and devoted father who adored his children and never missed any of their sporting activities,” she said in a prepared statement. “He was a true friend, and a faithful fighter for those who did not have a voice.”

This is the bolthole where Prince Andrew is alleged to have slept with an underage girl at an orgy – and where his sex offender pal is thought to be hiding out. For the first time, Jeffrey Epstein’s “Island of Sin” is seen, showing where teenage “sex slaves” were allegedly abused by the banker and some of the world’s most powerful men. Brought in on the billionaire’s private jets, nicknamed by locals as the Lolita Express, numerous girls were allegedly taken to his 78-acre Little Saint James hideout in the US Virgin Islands. It is claimed they were made to take part in depraved orgies.

Declassified Files Reveal Gov’t Plot to Carry Out Soviet False Flag Attacks in US to Start War

A recent revelation from the newly released JFK Files can now help put this entire Russian hacking scenario into context—as it has been the subject of previous propaganda campaigns. As the deep state continues to push the Russian election interference narrative—with no concrete evidence—the damage to US-Russia relations continues to grow. Sadly, those who continue to buy the Russiagate conspiracy theory have forgotten the US government’s history when it comes to propaganda used to start wars and bolster the military-industrial complex.

Maxine Waters to women: John Conyers ‘has impeccable integrity on our issues’

“Rep. John Conyers, newly facing sexual misconduct charges from former aides, was praised by fellow Rep. Maxine Waters just last month as a champion of women.

“During an address to organizers of the national Women’s March in which she lashed out at “rape culture” and President Trump, she singled out the Michigan lawmaker for special attention. “ ‘You know, there is a member of Congress who has been supportive of women for many, many, many years,” said said in a keynote address to the Women’s Convention Sojourner Truth Luncheon in Detroit. “ ‘He is quiet, he is confident, he is powerful, but he has impeccable integrity on all of our issues. Give John Conyers a big round of applause.”"

Could not God be an alien? Yes, He most certainly is an alien. The dictionary defines the word “alien” as: “coming from or existing outside the earth or its atmosphere.” God is not of this world. The Bible teaches that God created the universe, which means that His presence transcends this universe. It is contradictory for any Atheist to profess a belief in the existence of alien life (or at least the possibility thereof); while simultaneously denying the existence of God. If you believe that aliens may exist, then you certainly must concede that one of those aliens may be God. Some people believe that the Pyramids of Egypt were built by aliens; but the Bible teaches that slave Israelites built the treasure cities of Pithom and Raamses for Pharaoh (Exodus 1:11). Evidence shows that it was mankind, and not aliens, that built the Pyramids of Egypt. Perhaps you do not believe in alien life at all; but that would be speculation at best, because neither you nor anyone else can make such a claim with any confidence. How do you know that there is no alien life? So whether an Atheist believes in alien life or not is irrelevant to the fact that no one can say with any certainty that God does not exist. This logical reasoning proves that there is no such thing as a TRUE Atheist, only those who choose to reside in their ignorance of something they do not know for certain. Any honest person must admit that there could be a God. The fact that Atheists refuse to even consider the possibility that God exists is self-incriminating evidence against them, because they are willingly ignorant of the possibility that alien life may exist in the universe or beyond. Clearly, Atheists are biased against the Truth of God’s Word, without any logical reason or justification for their prejudice. Logic dictates that alien life certainly may exist, and that means God.

The combination satellite / radar image below reveals an extremely anomalous and alarming scenario: a massive, bizarre, and completely unnatural, straight, south to north flow of tropical moisture from the record warm waters of the Caribbean.

Again, the unprecedented scenario shown in the image above is warm tropical moisture which became a record breaking snowstorm as it reached the Great Lakes region. How is this possible? Massive climate engineering operations utilizing patented processes of chemical ice nucleation are at the core of this phenomenon.

Animations in the 40 second video further reveal the anomalous nature of this flow of moisture, which fueled the theatrically named “Winter Storm Xanto”.

Chemical ice nucleation (for weather modification) is a patented process, the link below is important to review in order to gain a better understanding of this process.

The next 8 links below provide further documentation and examples of the climate engineering chemical ice nucleation assault (and the processes involved).

The Departure From Normal High Temperature map below clearly shows a shocking temperature contrast scenario in the US Southeast.

Flows of moisture can (and are) being completely manipulated by the climate engineers with the use of atmospheric aerosol saturation and radio frequency / microwave transmissions. The NEXRAD image below was captured on April 15th, 2018.

As the US temperature map below reveals, on Sunday, April 15th, 2018, when “Winter Storm Xanto” was at its peak in the Western Great Lakes region. Temperatures further south along the path of the moisture flow feeding “Winter Storm Xanto” were in the 80s.

The Weather Channel temperature map below further reveals the completely anomalous and unnatural cool-down that climate engineering and chemical ice nucleation processes can create. Engineering winter weather from warmth (65 degrees and rain in Detroit, and snowing a short distance away).

The final map below is another Departure From Normal High Temperature illustration. The “bullseye” of cold temperatures west of the Great Lakes is very clearly visible (while most of the planet is at above normal temperatures).

Over 70 years ago governments around the world made the decision to launch the global geoengineering experiment without public knowledge or consent, an experiment from which there is no return. There can be no legitimate discussion about the state of the climate without first and foremost addressing the subject of climate engineering. Further, there can be no legitimate discussion about climate engineering without addressing the completely engineered cool-downs via atmospheric manipulation and patented chemical ice nucleation processes. Geoenginering operations are the greatest and most immediate threat we collectively face short of nuclear cataclysm.

 Dane Wigington

A lack of rain is way too simple an explanation for these conspiracy theorists – it’s why it hasn’t rained much in four years that matters: the US government is geoengineering the California climate.

To most Californians, the state’s four-year drought is not all that mysterious: it just hasn’t rained in a very long time.

Then there are those for whom that’s way too simple an explanation.

Last week, a crowd of several hundred turned out in Redding, in northern California, to hear grave warnings from a solar power contractor named Dane Wigington that the weather has been taken over by government geoengineers spraying our skies with toxic chemicals in a doomed attempt to slow down global warming.

In April, an essay published under the name “State of the Nation” argued that the drought was not only artificially created, it was in fact a stepping-stone in the US military-industrial complex’s master plan to take over the planet and achieve “total control of all of Earth’s resources”.

The country’s leading conspirator, radio host Alex Jones, has jumped on the bandwagon, as has Natural News, a website known for its campaigns against public vaccination programs.

Quite why the US government would want to fry California to a crisp is a matter of some confusion and debate. But the longer the drought goes on – it is already the longest of the modern era – the more currency the fringe theories appear to be gaining.

“There is NO NATURAL WEATHER at this point,” Wigington’s website asserts. “The climate engineers decide when it will rain or snow, where, how much, and how toxic the rain or snow will be, where there will be drought or heat.”

The conspiracists are in no doubt: the government is spraying chemicals and artificially holding back weather patterns off the California coast to keep the rain away. They are doing this with planes – Wigington likes to show audience footage of thick contrails spewing into the sky, evidence he calls “undeniable” – but they may also have operated in the past from a military installation in Alaska, now closed, called the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP.

HAARP has been a focus of conspiracy theorists for years and was previously blamed for Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy – even though its mandate, while it was operating, was to find clearer communications routes through the ionosphere and had nothing to do with climate.

Mainstream scientists and environmental activists listen to these theories and despair. “You want to pull your eyes out because these people are so fucking stupid,” David Allgood, political director of the California League of Conservation Voters, told the Guardian.

“The only agenda here is the agenda of the oil and coal companies. Exxon knew back in the 1970s that their products were destroying the planet and instead of doing something about it, they decided to go bribe the government. If people want to see conspiracies, it’s not the government causing them, it’s the fossil fuel industry.”

Wigington and his cohorts are not operating from pure fantasy. There is certainly a theory that by spraying certain chemicals into the air the effects of global warming might be slowed or reversed. There have certainly been experiments in “cloud-seeding” to provoke rainfall in different parts of the world going back to the 1950s – including unsuccessful attempts in California in the past couple years to help combat the drought.

But there is no evidence of weather manipulation techniques being used to combat global warming. Earlier this year, the Stanford climate scientist Ken Caldeira suggested that a small fleet of aircraft could do what large volcanoes do – “create a layer of small particles high in the atmosphere that scatters incoming sunlight back to space” – and thus cool the earth down.

The conspiracy theorists leapt on that line as vindication that they were right all along, without quoting what Caldeira said next: “It is possible, of course, that sustaining [this] kind of aerosol layer … would just make things worse. We just don’t know. We need to do the research.”

The conspiracies may die down if, as expected, an El Niño weather pattern brings heavy rainstorms to California this winter. Advocates like Wigington might also want to remember the example of Iran’s former president Mahmood Ahmadinejad, who in 2011 accused the west of conspiring to suck the water out of clouds above Iran as an act of aggression. As soon as Ahmadinejad finished speaking, the heavens opened."

(Natural News) The Chinese government has admitted that hundreds of thousands more doses of children’s vaccines are faulty, bringing the total number of vaccines known to be defective there to nearly one million.

The State Council of China announced that another batch of vaccines for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) that were produced by the firm Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, were considered “substandard.” Most of the doses were sold to authorities in the Shandong province in northeastern China, and some have already been given to children.

The latest batch of 247,200 vaccines joins the 253,338 defective DPT vaccines from the same company that were discovered last November, along with more than 400,000 produced by a different company.

According to the South China Morning Post, 76 percent of those children who were given injections from the first substandard batch have already been treated by doctors, and there are now plans in place to treat those who received injections from the second batch.

Although the Chinese government has done its best to prevent people from talking about the crisis, Chinese social media is still full of conversation about the topic. There have also been reports that the company used expired ingredients and altered testing records…."

It implies that there is missing information and attempts to mislead the public.","Former CIA Officer and whistleblower Kevin Shipp says what is going on in Washington D.C. with the “treason” against Trump is unlike anything we have ever faced as a nation. Shipp explains, “This is an historic battle between the President of the United States and what I call the ‘Shadow Government.’ Some call this the ‘Deep State,’ and that includes the CIA, the FBI and the NSA. President Trump is the first President to stand up against this Shadow Government. They have been spying on Trump since he was a presidential candidate. So, this is huge, it’s historic and nothing like this has ever occurred in any western government. . . . The Shadow Government has been controlling Congress, controlling the judiciary and controlling the President of the United States. No one has stood up against them until Donald J. Trump. They did not figure on this, and he is not bound to this Shadow Government or their threats. Trump has got them quaking in their boots because they have been engaged in illegal surveillance. They have been engaged in a false counter-intelligence against the Trump campaign, literally planting spies in the Trump campaign. I can guarantee you they are scrambling like rats trying to get off a ship. Comey points fingers at Clapper, he’s pointing fingers at Comey, there’s Loretta Lynch and on and on. They are scared because if this stuff is declassified, the American people will see what they have done. For some of these people, this amounts to treason. They attempted a coup against a duly elected President of the United States.”

Make no mistake, what happened to President Trump with the “hoax” of Russia collusion was a frame job to try to knock him out of office. Trump has called this “treason,” and when he says this, the mainstream media is silent and won’t report it. Shipp says, “They know it, and they are trying their level best to support these Shadow Government/Deep State players because the media was complicit in this false Russia collusion. There is no way they are going to report on information that will expose their role in it. . . . They shot and they missed, and it was a bad miss because they tipped their hand.”

Shipp says new Attorney General William Barr is the right man for the job of prosecuting treason. Shipp says, “Barr was a former CIA attorney . . . I was skeptical at first, but now I am right behind Barr. I think the fact that Barr was a CIA attorney gives him an inside view. . . . So, Barr has an edge . . . over the CIA and the FBI. He knows how that system works. He knows how they are going to stonewall him. He knows how they are going to use classification to try to conceal what they have done. They got the worst President and the worst Attorney General for them to expose what they are doing both at the same time. Barr has subpoena power, and they are quaking in their boots because this has never happened before. They have never been challenged like this before.”

This is simply a case of spying to get blackmail information against political opponents. It goes back to 2012 and was under the direction of President Obama, according to Shipp. Shipp explains, “This was NSA domestic surveillance, and it’s been going on since before 9/11. It increased after 9/11. What they did, Comey and others like Brennan, they went in and requested information existing already on NSA super computers and used that information to spy on the Trump Campaign. . . . They did spy on Donald Trump, and it was extensive. It was criminal and was existing systems the NSA already had in place. . . . This leads all the way to Barack Obama and, of course, Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton being the blackmailer extraordinaire and Barack Obama. . . . They were using this power to intimidate others and probably to blackmail others . . . that’s exactly what they were doing. . . . They were all engaging in flagrant criminal activity. They all thought the global princess was going to get elected, and all of a sudden—boom. The unthinkable happened for them. Donald Trump was elected, and they freaked out.”

Kevin Shipp predicts that CIA Director Gina Haspel will roll over and help AG Barr with the necessary information. On the other hand, Shipp says FBI Director Christopher Wray will probably need to be replaced in order to uncover the role the FBI played in the Trump/Russia “hoax.”

The Iranian chief executive stated that the world’s dominant powers deliberately bully the smaller nations, who are not in conflict with one another, thereby creating artificial problems between them.

President Ahmadinejad also pointed out that this new world order needs to be all-inclusive, and not be dominated by any particular single nation.

It also mentions the forbidden knowledge and the attempts to bypass the gatekeepers of free speech.,"Pulled from YouTube, censored in internet searches, and denounced by every single mainstream media outlet, what kind of information could make everyone so mad about ‘Plandemic’? We watched it to find out.

A 23-minute teaser clip of the documentary went viral on Wednesday evening, notching up tens of millions of views across multiple platforms. However, a media outcry soon followed, with mainstream media outlets deploying their ‘fact-checkers’ to debunk its claims, and Facebook and YouTube removing the video, citing their new rules on Covid-19 “misinformation.”

Yet censorship is also a sure-fire way to generate interest in the very thing you’re trying to censor – and multiple copies and versions of ‘Plandemic’ began to appear like mushrooms. So who’s behind it and what’s in there?

Dr. Judy Mikovits is the central figure of ‘Plandemic,’ which basically claims that “billionaire patent owners” are stoking the spread of the coronavirus, all in the name of forcing “experimental poisons” on the population in the form of vaccines.

The claims are quite bold, but it doesn’t help that Mikovits herself is far from an unbiased source on the subject. She’s been active in anti-vaccine and fringe circles for years, even while insisting she’s not “anti-vax” herself.

Once an active cancer researcher and (mainstream) virologist, Mikovits was disgraced in 2011 for publishing what others in the scientific community called false research into Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The dramatic events that followed – a search and arrest in her California home – are used in ‘Plandemic’ to establish her alleged conflict with Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and President Donald Trump’s coronavirus adviser.

Mikovits claims Fauci personally “paid off” law enforcement officials to arrest her and detain her without trial. She was indeed arrested in November 2011, but for allegedly stealing lab materials from the Nevada laboratory she worked at before her dismissal (which Mikovits claims were “planted” in her house). Criminal charges brought against Mikovits were later dismissed – but this has been tied to the legal troubles of her former employer, Harvey Whittemore.

Of course, the central part of the video – something being discussed in every ‘Plandemic’ piece and review – is made up of an array of Covid-19-related claims that Mikovits makes.

These range from claims that wearing face masks “activates your own virus” (there’s no evidence of that) to the assertion that the devastating coronavirus outbreak in Northern Italy can be linked to the uptake in flu vaccination the year before (a claim which appears to be based on a misleading interpretation of one tangentially-related study, not any fresh research).

Mikovits’ central argument – that an eventual vaccine for coronavirus will kill “millions of people” – is unprovable, and her assertion that Fauci will personally profit from any vaccine is outright false. Mikovits accuses Fauci of profiteering from royalties on an AIDS treatment he patented in the 1990s, but Fauci only placed his name on the patent because regulations required him to, and “donated the entire amount to charity.”

However, amid the half-baked theories, Mikovits touches on some truth. The federal government does in fact pay hospitals a set amount of money to treat coronavirus patients, about $13,000. This amount rises to $39,000 if the patient is placed on a ventilator. Mikovits insists that ventilation is the wrong treatment for coronavirus patients, and is only carried out to boost revenues – something the ER doctors would disagree with.

It doesn’t help that many of the claims are disjointed, and rather than working towards its main goal of demonstrating a sinister plan by Fauci and vaccine evangelist Bill Gates to poison the masses, the documentary instead just lumps together anything critical of the mainstream consensus on the virus to paint Fauci in a bad light.

For instance, it’s been widely reported that Fauci’s organization did give millions of dollars to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to finance its study of coronaviruses, after the federal government banned such research in the US. However, no smoking gun linking Fauci to the current outbreak is provided.

Yet, when information like this is declared verboten, that’s what people will think. There’s a popular quote by ‘Game of Thrones’ author George RR Martin: “When you tear out a man’s tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you’re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.”

When right-wing polemicist Alex Jones and his conspiracy-laden news site Infowars were essentially banned from the internet in 2018, the Infowars app shot to the top of both Apple and Google’s app stores.

The phenomenon is known as the ‘Streisand effect,’ named for a 2003 lawsuit in which singer Barbara Streisand sued a photographer who shot an aerial snap of her California mansion for invasion of privacy. The lawsuit backfired, and led to hundreds of thousands of people downloading the picture. Before the case, it had only been viewed six times.

Likewise, the documentary’s producers will spin the furor over ‘Plandemic’ to their advantage. Already, their website urges viewers to “bypass the gatekeepers of free speech,” and slams the “overlords of big tech” for silencing them.

Forbidden knowledge is tempting, and by wiping ‘Plandemic’ from the internet, Silicon Valley will only increase its notoriety."
354,False,This article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions economist John Williams as the main actor.,True,The article discusses the potential actions of Russia selling its U.S. dollar holdings and the potential consequences on the financial system.,True,"The article mentions the potential threat of massive dollar dumping globally and the negative consequences it could have on markets, interest rates, and inflation.",False,There is no mention of patterns or connections between events in the article.,False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"Economist John Williams says if Russia sells its U.S. dollar holdings, it could trigger hyperinflation. Could it collapse the financial system? Williams contends, “Yes, it certainly has a potential to do that. Looking outside the United States, there is something over $16 trillion in cash, or near cash. That’s about the same size as our GDP. . . Nobody has wanted to hold the dollar for some time. The dollar, fundamentally, is weak. It couldn’t be weaker. All the major factors are against it. It’s just a matter of what would trigger the massive selling. Nobody wants to hold it. The Russians start selling, and you have China indicating a general alliance here in terms of what’s transpiring. If the rest of the world believes this is what’s going to happen, people who have been wanting to get out of the dollar for some time very easily could front-run the Russians. The scare is on. People will try to get out of it as rapidly as they can.

What would happen if there was massive dollar dumping globally? Williams says, “It would be disastrous for our markets. All those excess dollars coming in, with bonds being sold, interest rates would spike. The stock market would sell off and we’d see inflation. To prevent that and try and keep things stable, the Fed would tend to buy up those Treasuries. It would intervene wherever it could to stabilize the circumstance. It’s going to be very difficult, and it’s going to be very inflationary. Williams goes on to say, “You have to keep in mind, back in 2008, we had one of the greatest financial crises the United States had ever faced. The system was on the brink of collapse at that point in time. What the Fed and the federal government did was spend every penny they could, anything they could create or anything they could guarantee. They did everything they could possibly do to keep the system from crashing. They guaranteed all bank accounts. So, they saved the system, but now what they did has not borne fruit. We have not seen an economic recovery. We have not seen a return of health to the banking system. So, the system is very vulnerable; and if the Russians carry through with their threat, you have, indeed, the risk of it collapsing the system.”

Is this the end of the world as we know it in the U.S.? Williams says, “It does have the effect of creating a hyperinflation, which I think it would. It’s the type of circumstance that will not allow life to continue as we know it because the U.S. is not able to handle hyperinflation. We’re not structured for it. Zimbabwe had one of the worst hyperinflations that anyone has ever seen. They were still able to function for a while because they get paid in a rapidly depreciating currency. It was so rapid it became like toilet paper overnight, but they would go to a black market and exchange it for dollars. We (the U.S.) don’t have a black market to escape from our dollars. Gold is probably the closest thing to that. Gold will tend to rally here as the dollar sells off, baring very heavy intervention by the central banks which you may see. The fundamentals will eventually dominate, and you will see a very weak dollar and very strong gold coming out of this.”

Don’t look for the U.S. dollar as the safe haven because Williams says, “Historically the dollar has been the safe haven in a political or financial crisis, but that hasn’t been the case for four or five years now. Instead, what you have seen is a flight to other traditional safe havens such as gold and the Swiss Franc. The dollar has lost its magic. Nobody wants to hold it. So, if the Russians follow through and convince the rest of the world that they are going to do it and it looks like China may join them, a lot of countries will want to dump dollars and get out ahead of the crowd.”

On the overall economy, Williams says, “It is rolling over, and the numbers are starting to show we are starting into a new recession. You should have an actual quarterly contraction in the first quarter GDP. One of the best indicators of that are retail sales, and they gave a clear recession signal in January. That’s the strongest recession signal since September of 2007, which is three months before the ‘Great Recession’ took place, and I’ll contend it never ended.”

We are running a credit system. Instead of using savings, we are using credit. Credit, the way we are doing it now, is really a form of counterfeiting. If you look at the $72 trillion shadow banking system that we have operating right now, that is generating this credit . . . it collapsed in 2008 . . . and now it’s on a hairy edge. It’s not mortgages and housing this time. It’s student loans through Sallie Mae. These students don’t have any hope of paying this back. We are talking north of $1.1 to $1.2 trillion. It’s car loans this time because of subprime. That’s the way to look at car loans, they are sub-prime. . . . And you got these highly leveraged real estate investment trusts also operating through the shadow banking system. These problems are blatantly evident, and I don’t think the powers that be have any control over them.”

On the next financial crisis, Mr. Long contends, “I think 2008 was an early warning signal of the magnitude of the problem. We didn’t fix it. We did extend and pretend. Dodd-Frank did not solve the underlying issues. The global swaps market went from $600 trillion to $700 trillion last year, alone. We’ve watched the shadow banking system push through $72 trillion. So, we didn’t stop it. We just, in fact, inflamed it even worse, and we got into even riskier kinds of assets. Is it imminent? No, I think we are talking 2015. I think we have a little bit of a deflation scare before we get into the hyperinflation. Don’t underestimate the central bankers and the politicians’ ability to kick the can down the road. They still got some more bullets here.”

Will the crisis in Iraq get out of control? Gordon Long says, “I happen to think that it probably will because we are not resolving the basic problems. But the big core issue here is the petrodollar. It’s not about oil and it’s not about gas. It’s about what it is bought and paid for in, and that is U.S. dollars. There is no one that trades any one of those products in anything other than U.S. dollars . . . right now, as of today. . . . As long as the trading continues in U.S. dollars, all those dollars will stay out there and not come back to the United States. When it comes back to the United States, you will have hyperinflation. These conflicts need to be seen in the context of they are really going to force groups to trade in other than the U.S dollar. That’s the problem because they are going to come back. They are going to say I have a U.S. dollar, and I am going to make a claim on it. That’s what is going to drive the hyperinflation. That’s what is going to drive the currency crisis. This is about trading in the U.S. dollar. . . . We are looking at spring 2015 to Q three. There is trouble there.”

On government debt and suspicious bond buying in places like Belgium, Gordon Long says the government has to keep finding was to sell Treasury bonds to finance the huge U.S. debt. Long explains, “They not only have to sustain the buying, but they actually, right now, need a shock to the system, what I will call a bond scare, so money will move out of an over-inflated equity market. . . . And they need that to drive down the interest rates, push up the bond prices and get that financing charge much lower.” Long goes on to say, “The real game that is going on here is a complex game, but it’s pretty simple, what they are trying to do and that is they are trying to finance the government’s debt.”

356,True,The article suggests that the government and Big Pharma are working together to push pharmaceutical solutions and vaccines while ignoring natural therapies and immune-boosters.

But what about nutrition, herbs, and other natural therapies?

A recent op-ed laments the possibility that there might never be a “magic bullet” to cure the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which would mean that the pandemic will simply have to run its course. But, again, that magic bullet could be as simple as getting lots of sunlight and vitamin D, drinking clean water, resting, and fortifying one’s natural defenses through robust nutrition.

Somehow, it is never on the radar of those in charge to even suggest that people do what they can to support their own natural immunity. It is always just pharmaceuticals, poison jabs, and other draconian deep state “solutions” that are presented publicly, which keeps many people in a constant state of fear and despair as they feel helpless to take care of themselves.

Over the past several months, there have been stories here and there that have come out to suggest that things like high-dose vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, and other immune-boosters could help to protect against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). But not a single government official has thus far made mention of any of this, instead pointing to some future vaccine that probably will not work and could end up harming and killing millions.

Big Pharma is, of course, a big part of this agenda, as it is using the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to basically enslave humanity. Listen below to The Health Ranger Report with Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, to learn more:

When will Americans break outside the box of demanding drugs and vaccines for every ailment?

The threat of continued “waves” of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infections does not have to be as dire as the “experts” are claiming, if only they would acknowledge that there is another way to go about protecting oneself from it. The constituents found in coconut oil, for example, have been found to offer protective benefits against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), as well as against many other viruses and harmful bacteria.

Coconut oil, as you probably well know, is a widely available “superfood” that just about everyone can find at their local grocery store. Advising people to consume it daily would be a simple and inexpensive way to promote public health naturally during this pandemic, and yet it will more than likely never happen.

Anti-nutrition politics are so deeply embedded within the establishment, even under President Trump, that the system cannot allow or tolerate any deviation from the standard protocols of excessive hand-washing, lots of disinfectant chemicals, and plenty of fear. And many Americans are simply too brainwashed and programmed by the deep state to ever even accept advice that might recommend vitamins and superfoods as a, dare we say, cure for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

It apparently takes a whole lot of critical thinking outside the box to accept the notion that the things God put on this green earth for our use might just be the magic bullet that everyone is looking for. And very few people, sadly, possess the ability to critically think.

Meanwhile, the establishment is working on some 90 different vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), if you can believe it. And many of these are currently in the process of undergoing clinical trials as most Americans are still in the mindset of demanding some kind of jab for every health woe that comes their way.

The videos, curiously, are being shared enthusiastically by many Republicans and pro-Israel hawks, who aren’t traditionally the sort of crowd you see rallying to support the civil rights of Muslims. What’s up with that?

Well, you may want to sit down for this shocker, but it turns out that they happen to be women from a nation that the US war machine is currently escalating operations against. They are Iranian.

Whenever you see the sudden emergence of an attractive media campaign that is sympathetic to the plight of civilians in a resource-rich nation unaligned with the western empire, you are seeing propaganda. When that nation is surrounded by other nations with similar human rights transgressions and yet those transgressions are ignored by that same media campaign, you are most certainly seeing propaganda. When that nation just so happens to already be the target of starvation sanctions and escalated covert CIA ops, you can bet the farm that you are seeing propaganda.

Back in December a memo was leaked from inside the Trump administration showing how then-Secretary of State, DC neophyte Rex Tillerson, was coached on how the US empire uses human rights as a pretense on which to attack and undermine noncompliant governments. Politico reports:

The propaganda machine doesn’t operate any differently from the State Department, since they serve the same establishment. US ally Saudi Arabia is celebrated by the mass media for “liberal reform” in allowing women to drive despite hard evidence that those “reforms” are barely surface-level cosmetics to present a pretty face to the western world, but Iranian women, who have been able to drive for years, are painted as uniquely oppressed. Iran is condemned by establishment war whores for the flaws in its democratic process, while Saudi Arabia, an actual monarchy, goes completely unscrutinized.

This is because the US-centralized power establishment, which has never at any point in its history cared about human rights, plans on effecting regime change in Iran by any means necessary. Should those means necessitate a potentially controversial degree of direct military engagement, the empire needs to make sure it retains control of the narrative.

This is what war propaganda looks like in the era of social media. It will never look ugly. It will never directly show you its real intentions. If it did, it wouldn’t work. It can’t just come right out and say “Hey we need to do horrible, evil things to the people in this country on the other side of the world in your name using your resources, please play along without making a fuss.” It will necessarily look fresh and fun and rebellious. It will look appealing. It will look sexy.

And it’s working. I am currently getting tagged in these videos multiple times a day by Trump supporters who are eager to show me proof that I’m on the wrong side of the Iran issue; the psyop is so well-lubricated with a combination of sleek presentation and confirmation bias that it slides right past their skepticism and becomes accepted as fact, even the one with the Now This pussyhat propaganda logo in the corner.

Be less trusting of these monsters, please. The people of Afghanistan haven’t benefitted from the interminable military quagmire that has cost tens of thousands of their lives. The invaders of Iraq were never “greeted as liberators” by an oppressed population. The humanitarian intervention in Libya left a humanitarian catastrophe in its wake far more horrific than anything it claimed to be trying to prevent. Saving the children of Syria with western interventionism has left half a million Syrians dead.

If the Iranians do in fact wish to change their government, it should happen without crippling sanctions, collaboration with extremist terror cults, or the rapey tentacles of the CIA manipulating the situation. There has never been a US-led regime change in the Middle East that wasn’t disastrous. People should be screaming at the US and its allies to cease these interventions, not applauding propaganda that is clearly being manufactured by that same empire.

BELL TOLLING for the Swine Flu (ENGLISH subtitled) from ALISH on Vimeo.

What’s a nun doing talking on the Internet about the dangers of the Influenza A vaccine?

Our rule prescribes five hours of prayer and six of work. Ora et labora.

I devote part of the working hours to medical research. I’m a doctor of medicine and in 2006 I published the study Crimes and Abuses of the Pharmaceutical Industry.

When did you decide you had to speak out on influenza A?

In May this year I was asked to give a speech on the papillomavirus vaccine and I was very struck by the lack of scientific basis for the official recommendations. After a few days I spoke on TV-3 about this vaccine and since then I have been receiving requests to comment on the influenza A vaccine.

Doesn’t the World Health Organization deserve to be trusted?

I don’t understand the motives that have led WHO to act in the absurd way it is acting.

Yes. Last May, WHO changed the official definition of a pandemic — it changed from a logical definition (a pandemic is an infection of global proportions and with a high mortality) to an illogical definition (a pandemic is an infection of global proportions).

What are the consequences of this change?

Under the new definition of “pandemic”, the annual [seasonal] flu more than meets the requirements to be one. Are we going to declare a world health alert every fall? Besides absurdity from the scientific standpoint, this has serious financial and policy consequences.

You don’t trust the vaccine. Why?

Unlike the annual seasonal flu vaccine, the influenza vaccine contains such powerful adjuvant substances that they can get the normal immune response to multiply by a factor of 10. In addition, two doses are recommended, to be received after the injection for seasonal influenza, which also contains adjuvants, although less potent. Never before have these substances been injected three times in a row in the general population, starting with children, the chronically ill and pregnant women.

The artificial stimulation of the immune system can cause autoimmune diseases.

The same prospect of two of the influenza vaccines that have already been approved in Europe (Pandemrix and Focetra) indicates that it is expected that for every million people vaccinated, 99 will experience an autoimmune disease known as Guillain-Barré progressive paralysis.

If that happens, the drug companies would receive demands…

But in the U.S. a decree has already been approved exempting politicians and drug companies from liability.

Are you suggesting that the drug companies have acted irresponsibly?

What they have done is work for their interests.

Can someone be obliged to get vaccinated?

In 2007, WHO adopted a regulation establishing an exception. In all cases except one, the WHO makes recommendations, and only in one case may it give orders that override the sovereignty of member countries.

In the case of a pandemic.

Exactly. In 2007, WHO adopted a regulation that in case of a pandemic, WHO can legally bind member countries to vaccinate all or part of their population. The governments of these countries would be obliged then to impose fines or other penalties for individuals who refuse to be vaccinated.

Do you believe in world conspiracies?

I think there are interests at stake are not the good of the population. How can we justify the money invested in the purchase of vaccines if influenza A is milder than the annual seasonal flu? Spending so much money on vaccines and other preventive measures without sufficient scientific basis is an outrage and we should ask for accountability.

What do your fellow nuns say about the video and your statements?

An almost 90 year old sister raised the objection that the subject of influenza A is very serious and that I couldn’t speak out against the vaccine without having well-founded arguments.

After reading my report, she approached me after vespers and simply said to me: “Understood.”

As much as I can."

 January 15, 2017 by Baxter Dmitry

 Dr Udo Ulfkotte, the former German newspaper editor whose bestselling book exposed how the CIA controls German media, has been found dead. He was 56.

 Ulfkotte was an editor at Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, one of the largest newspapers in Germany, when he published Bought Journalists, the bestselling book that cost him his job and perhaps his life.

 German media, who were banned from reporting on his work in recent years, are reporting he died of “heart failure”.

 Acknowledging that his life was under threat, Ulfkotte explained that he was in a better position than most journalists to expose the truth because he didn’t have any children who could be threatened.

 Speaking to the Russian newspaper Russian Insider, Ulkfotte said: “When I told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Ulfkotte’s newspaper) that I would publish the book, their lawyers sent me a letter threatening with all legal consequences if I would publish any names or secrets – but I don’t mind. You see, I don’t have children to take care of.“

 His fears for a war in Europe, lead him to his decision to tell the truth about corporate media being controlled by intelligence services on behalf of the financial class.

 “I’ve been a journalist for about 25 years, and I’ve been educated to lie, to betray, and not to tell the truth to the public,” Ulfkotte told Russia Today. “I was supported by the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA. Why? Because I am pro-American.”

 “The German and American media tries to bring war to the people in Europe, to bring war to Russia. This is a point of no return, and I am going to stand up and say… it is not right what I have done in the past, to manipulate people, to make propaganda against Russia.”

 Ulfkotte said most corporate media journalists in the United States and Europe are “so-called non-official cover,” meaning that they work for an intelligence agency. “I think it is especially the case with British journalists, because they have a much closer relationship. It is especially the case with Israeli journalists. Of course with French journalists. … It is the case for Australians, [with] journalists from New Zealand, from Taiwan, well, there is many countries,” he said.

 

 Ulfkotte’s book Bought Journalists became a bestseller in Germany but, in a bizarre twist which Ulfkotte says characterizes the disconnect caused by CIA control of the western media, the book cannot be reported on by the German press.

 Ulfkotte said: “No German mainstream journalist is allowed to report about [my] book. Otherwise he or she will be sacked. So we have a bestseller now that no German journalist is allowed to write or talk about.”

 Among the stories Ulfkotte says he was ordered by the CIA to plant in his newspaper was a fake story that Libyan President Moammar Gaddafi was building poison gas factories in 2011.

 “The German and American media tries to bring war to the people in Europe, to bring war to Russia,” he told RT.

 “This is a point of no return, and I am going to stand up and say … it is not right what I have done in the past, to manipulate people, to make propaganda against Russia, and it is not right what my colleagues do, and have done in the past, because they are bribed to betray the people not only in Germany, all over Europe. … I am very fearful of a new war in Europe, and I don’t like to have this situation again, because war is never coming from itself, there is always people who push for war, and this is not only politicians, it is journalists too. … We have betrayed our readers, just to push for war. … I don’t want this anymore; I’m fed up with this propaganda. We live in a banana republic, and not in a democratic country where we have press freedom.”

 Frogmen Beware: New Russian Underwater Grenade Launcher Hits IDEX-2015

 Russia will integrate the AU-220M, a 5-mm automatic turret with an armored vehicle built by the United Arab Emirates, following a memorandum signed by Russia’s Rosoboronexportprom and UAE’s Emirates Defense Technology (EDT) during the IDEX-2015 defense expo in Abu Dhabi.

 The AU-220M module is designed for armored vehicles, both new and undergoing modernization. The naval version of the module is capable of hitting targets on land, air and sea, with a horizontal range of 12 kilometer and a vertical range of 8 kilometers.

 The module will be integrated with an 8×8 platform produced by EDT, presumably the Enigma Armored Modular Fighting Vehicle (AMFV).

 The AU-220M is manufactured by the Burevestnik Central Research Institute, part of the Uralvagonzavod corporation.

General immunization rates are high, but the number of children not receiving some or all of recommended vaccines is on the rise. An Australian poll shows that lack of trust in institutions and government is a major factor. Although there are many studies that show vaccines are a major cause if autism, WHO continues to carry the flag for the pharmaceutical industry and insists that the studies are not valid. -GEG

Vaccine hesitancy, where people are reluctant or refuse to have themselves or their children vaccinated, is a growing trend among those fearing negative health outcomes from immunizations, such as the (non-existent) risk of autism. This collective uncertainty has now gathered such momentum that the World health Organization (WHO) sees fit to list vaccine hesitancy as one of its 10 threats to global health in 2019, alongside other more established dangers such as air pollution and drug-resistant bacteria.

While general immunization rates are high, the number of young children not receiving some or all of their recommended vaccines is on the rise. Health data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention charts a concerning uptick since 2000. According to its analysis, 1.3 percent of the children born in 2015 in the US went without any recommended vaccinations, up from 0.9 percent in 2011 and 0.3 percent in 2001.

The reasons for this are varied, but according to its vaccines advisory group, WHO lists complacency, inconvenience in accessing vaccines and a lack of confidence as driving factors in vaccine hesitancy. One survey carried out by the University of South Australia involving 604 pregnant women found a lack of trust in institutions and government to be a major factor, along with a parent’s lack of personal experience in their child falling sick."

The evidence is now overwhelming that 9/11 was a ‘false flag’ event, organised and engineered by a combination of Israeli (Mossad) and domestic right wing and secret agencies (CIA) dominated by people with either Jewish heritage or holding joint American/Israeli nationality.

The only significant question remaining is why there was no criminal investigation, why heavily implicated suspects in the detention of the police were allowed to escape without charge, official inquiries were suborned and why even to this day leading western politicians refuse to acknowledge the facts, pour scorn on those that do and even threaten them with prosecution for allegedly ‘supporting terrorism’?

Only a criminal conspiracy at the highest levels of western governments, can explain this failure to pursue the guilty or reveal the truth to the world’s population. The only logical conclusion: they are all, despite assurances to the contrary and superficial appearances, irremediably corrupt, knowingly and intentionally colluding in the execution and cover-up of one of the biggest and most deplorable crimes of the century.

When, eventually after careful and detailed consideration, you are forced to come to the unsavoury conclusion that the State of Israel and Jewish interests were centrally involved in the 9/11 outrage, all subsequent and current events must take on a completely new perspective.

Is it any wonder those in charge are running scared and have to continually reinvent a demonic enemy, with further ‘terrorist events’, to justify its stance and hegemony? Nor why the governments of the west are so keen to confuse the proper pursuit of criminals and the truth with the smear tactic of ‘anti-semitism’."

The same Al-Qaeda terrorists who fought U.S. troops in Iraq and helped NATO overthrow Colonel Gaddafi are now being airlifted into Syria to aid rebels there topple President Bashar al-Assad.

Libya’s transitional ruling authority has agreed to send weapons and fighters over to Syria to help the Free Syrian Army fight government forces.

“There is something being planned to send weapons and even Libyan fighters to Syria,” a Libyan source told the London Telegraph, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There is a military intervention on the way. Within a few weeks you will see.”

In a separate piece, the Telegraph also reports that terrorist commander Abdulhakim Belhadj, now head of the Tripoli Military Council, “met with Free Syrian Army leaders in Istanbul and on the border with Turkey,” after being sent there by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the interim Libyan president.

A rival Libyan rebel brigade detained Belhadj at Tripoli airport for traveling on a fake passport and threatened to jail him before Jalil stepped in to intervene.

“Members of the Free Syrian Army on the borders of Lebanon and Turkey denied rumours circulating in Tripoli that “hundreds” of Libyans had tried to cross into Syria,” states the article, amidst other reports that Libyans have already been detained trying to infiltrate the country from the Turkish border.

As we previously documented, Abdulhakim Belhadj is the former front man for the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), designated as a terrorist organization by the US State Department. Belhadj was captured by the CIA in Malaysia in 2003 and extradited to Libya where Colonel Gaddafi had him imprisoned. Belhadj is a committed jihadist who fought with the Taliban against U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Libyan rebel leader Abdel-Hakim al-Hasidi also admitted that Belhadj’s LIFG fighters were the second-largest cohort of foreign fighters in Iraq, responsible for killing U.S. troops.

A 2007 West Point report indicated that the Benghazi-Darnah-Tobruk area of Libya is a world capital for Al-Qaeda or mujahideen suicide bomber recruitment. Author Webster Tarpley details this intelligence in his excellent analysis piece, The CIA’s Libya Rebels: The Same Terrorists who Killed US, NATO Troops in Iraq. The West Point report detailed how the LIFG and Al-Qaeda had formed an “increasingly co-operative relationship”.

Libyan rebels have gone on to impose a “reign of terror” across the country, throwing blacks in concentration camps while torturing and murdering thousands of others before imposing Sharia law. The official Al-Qaeda flag now flies high and proud above Libyan cities as armed gangs roam the streets.

Following the fall of Tripoli, reports circulated that Libyan rebels had acquired a deadly arsenal of weapons, many of which are now on their way to Syria to aid in the overthrow of Assad.

“Qatar and Turkey were reported to be airlifting “volunteers” from Libya to fight alongside the rebel Free Syrian Army, some also transporting weapons,” reports Israeli intelligence source DebkaFile.

These terrorists have already been implicated in the killing of 10 air force personnel at a Syrian military base last week, even as the western media continues to characterize opposition fighters as “protesters,” just as they did with Libyan rebels who were commandeering fighter jets and firing rocket-propelled grenades.

While being hailed as liberators and freedom fighters by the media, terrorists who killed U.S. troops and who are now throwing black Libyans in torture camps, are yet again going to be used as the vanguard of the next act of US/NATO middle eastern regime change, all carefully orchestrated under the smoke and mirrors of the contrived “Arab Spring”.

In related developments, DebkaFile also reports that “Israeli armored brigades pushed forward up to the Lebanese and Syrian borders,” over the weekend, while US and Russian warships are now “in the midst of a naval buildup opposite Syrian shores.”

As we reported last week, in an identical pattern to how U.S. warships surrounded Libya in the days before the NATO bombardment began, the aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush was repositioned off the coast of Syria in recent days having moved from its usual theater of operations in the Straits of Hormuz.

This followed reports that Russian warships carrying sophisticated missile defense systems entered Syrian territorial waters last week as a deterrent to any NATO-led assault.

• “Newspaper of record” says initial Iraq war reporting driven by “outside agendas.”
• Public editor admits readers should be “wary” about what appears in pages of Times.

Just as the United States appears poised to get involved ever-deeper in the cauldron of Iraq—a toxic brew that is a direct consequence of the American invasion of that country in 2003—The New York Times is crying “boo hoo hoo” and admitting—and apologizing for—the fact that its lead-up coverage of that war was biased in favor of the Bush administration’s disastrous decision to attack that once-thriving Arab republic.

Actually, this is nothing new. In the past, well after the damage was done, the Times—often hailed as “America’s newspaper of record”—loudly and publicly admitted, just for the record, that its reporting had been skewed.

Now—with talk of U.S. “re-intervention” in the headlines—the Times is acknowledging, in advance, that (once again) its coverage has been biased in favor of war.

On June 28, Margaret Sullivan, the “public editor” of the Times—who presumably looks out for the interests of the Times’s readers versus those of its owners and other elements of influence—sobbed, “The lead-up to the war in Iraq in 2003 was not the Times’s finest hour. Some of the news reporting was flawed, driven by outside agendas and lacking in needed skepticism. Many Op-Ed columns promoted the idea of a war that turned out to be both unfounded and disastrous.”

Ms. Sullivan did not mention specifically what “outside agendas” influenced the Times—but more about that in a moment.

Admitting that “readers have not forgotten” and that more than a decade later, it’s one of the topics she hears most about, Ms. Sullivan said that given the Times’s “troubled history” readers do “have good reason to be wary about what appears in the paper about military intervention in Iraq.”

Ms. Sullivan points out that today—just as in 2003—critics contend the Times “is amplifying the voices of hawkish neoconservatives,” at the same time failing to give attention to the concerns of those who oppose another U.S. intervention. And having reviewed recent news coverage, she admits “the readers have a point worth considering.” She acknowledges the war hawks “are certainly being heard” and that the Times has only included “limited response” from their critics.

Naturally, Ms. Sullivan avoids mentioning what forces may be dictating the Times’s bias: what pro-Israel Jewish writer Michael Kinsley referred to as far back as October 24, 2002 as “the proverbial elephant in the room”—the central role of Israel in the debate over the initial American attack on Iraq. “Everybody sees it, nobody mentions it,” said Kinsley.

It took liberal Representative Jim Moran (D-Va.) to articulate the unmentionable, saying: “If it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war in Iraq, we would not be doing this.” And, naturally, for saying this, Moran took quite a bit of heat.

However, what Moran said—linking Israel and its U.S. supporters to the push for war—was not so extraordinary. On February 18, 2003, then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was calling for America to move on Iran, Libya and Syria after what was presumed to be the successful forthcoming destruction of Iraq. Sharon said, “These are irresponsible states, which must be disarmed of weapons of mass destruction, and a successful American move in Iraq as a model will make that easier to achieve.” At the time, Sharon told a visiting delegation of American congressmen that “the American action [against Iraq] is of vital importance.”

Just days later, on February 27, 2003, the Times reported that Israel not only advocated a U.S. war on Iraq, but that Israel also believed, ultimately, the war should be expanded to other nations perceived as threats to Israel. The Times stated:

Many in Israel are so certain of the rightness of a war on Iraq that officials are already thinking past that conflict to urge a continued, assertive American role in the Middle East. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz told members of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations last week that after Iraq, the United States should generate “political, economic, diplomatic pressure’’ on Iran. “We have great interest in shaping the Middle East the day after’’ a war, he said. Israel regards Iran and Syria as greater threats and is hoping that once Saddam Hussein is dispensed with, the dominoes will start to tumble.

On April 16, 2004, the New York-based Forward, one of the most respected Jewish community newspapers in America, summed it all up saying that “on the eve of the war, Israel was a quiet but enthusiastic supporter of America’s war plans” and that “Israel uniquely benefited from a war that is increasingly controversial in America and around the world.”

Now today, we again need to consider the questions surrounding the U.S. attack on Iraq (and Syria and Iran): Who wants war? And who benefits? Looking at what happened in the past, we already have the answers."
369,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions actors such as Left-wing financiers, professional rabble-rousers, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Democratic Party, and George Soros.",True,"The article discusses the actions of the mindless, violent mobs on the left and the protests that have grown in ferocity and destruction.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"It’s time to start arresting, prosecuting and imprisoning the mindless, violent mobs on the left

Even before Donald J. Trump handed Hillary Clinton a second humiliating loss in her bid for the White House, angry mobs, egged on by Left-wing financiers and professional rabble-rousers, were using the Constitution’s First Amendment as a cover to trash entire city blocks, injure police officers and attack innocent Americans.

After Trump won the election, the protests continued, and have grown in ferocity and destruction. And today, no matter what Trump does – even if he does something that every previous president has done, including the Left’s darling, Barack Obama – it is used as just another reason to justify more violence.

This kind of scene is being repeated – over and over and over again, in city after city across the country. And it’s not Trump supporters who are committing this violence; by and large, it’s coming from the angry Left.

Granted, many of these are young people who are simply being played by puppet masters like Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Democratic Party and George Soros – the political figures overtly call for “action,” while behind-the-scenes financiers like Soros provide the funding.

What we’re left with is a toxic brew of lies, falsehoods, mistrust and pure hatred. (RELATED: Our civil society is breaking down, and we track and document it at Collapse.news)

So we need to say this just as plainly as we possibly can: It’s time to start arresting, prosecuting and imprisoning the violent, mindless mobs who are destroying the fabric of our society.

For all the talk of the “peaceful transition of power” from Obama to Trump, there has been a transfer of power, alright, but it hasn’t been very peaceful, as we’ve seen. Indeed, there were protests in Washington and around the country the day after he was sworn into office, which is nearly unprecedented.

And there are incidents cropping up all over the country like the one in the video above.

Meanwhile, as Trump attempts to heal the country while still trying to govern, there is abject and noticeable silence coming from Obama, Clinton, and every single Democrat in Congress – a tacit if not overt endorsement of the “Resist” movement that has sprung up.

“President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,” his spokesman, Kevin Lewis, said in a statement. “In his final official speech as president, he spoke about the important role of citizens and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy — not just during an election but every day.”

This statement indicates that Obama, as was predicted, has already stepped into the fray to criticize Trump in a way his predecessor, George W. Bush, never did, and easily could have. This will only serve to further undermine Trump, as the discredited establishment press continues to treat Obama as though he’s a president in abstention and, thus, relevant.

“This is entirely unprecedented in modern presidential politics and violates the unstated decorum that generally has governed the conduct of presidents after leaving office,” Michael Johns, who served as a speechwriter in the administration of George H.W. Bush, told Lifezette. “Everything Trump has done in the first week is truly consistent with what he promised he would do.”

It’s all part of the strategy to be a consistent thorn in Trump’s side, and to keep the angry Left angry, destructive and damaging to civil society. (RELATED: Keep current with how the Left threatens America at Bugout.news)

When Americans are being attacked merely for expressing a political viewpoint – by people who justify it simply because it differs from their political viewpoint – the victims aren’t the fascists and the Nazis, the attackers are.

At some point, there will be one attack too many, and the fuse will be lit. But before that happens, Trump can stop it. He has the means, as president, to bring law and order back to our country, and that may necessarily involve the invocation of some drastic measures like declaring a state of emergency and empowering local police and federal agencies to make mass arrests of people who are no longer merely “protesting,” but who have become anarchists, craving and fomenting lawlessness, violence and destruction.

Would a few months’ worth of limited freedoms be a small price to pay to avoid the large-scale warfare and destruction that the Left seems determined to cause?

The surge of autism diagnoses in recent years has left many people looking for an explanation. Oft-labeled a “conspiracy theory,” or something to that effect, the suspicion that vaccines are a potential cause of autism is on the rise. New research from the Canadian government has indirectly shown that in highly vaccinated populations, autism rates are noticeably higher. These shocking findings are sure to leave vaccine propagandists reeling while they try to somehow discredit the findings of a government agency.

As The World Mercury Project reports, Canada ranks in the “top 10” countries for autism rates. In 2018, it was revealed that 1 in 66 Canadian children were on the autism spectrum, based on data collected in 2015.

The Public Health Agency of Canada even crafted the “National ASD Surveillance System,” or NASS, to track the number of people diagnosed with autism. The system was intended to provide a look at autism diagnoses “both across regions and over time.”

The agency’s efforts proved successful, showing a steady increase in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnoses since 2003 — as well as substantial differences from region to region.

As The World Mercury Project explains, six provinces British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec and one Canadian territory (Yukon) were featured in the research.

The three regions with the highest autism prevalence were Newfoundland and Labrador (1 in 57), Prince Edward Island (1 in 59) and Quebec (1 in 65). Comparatively, the Yukon boasted significantly lower rates of autism, at just 1 in 125.

Moreover, the provinces with the highest rates of autism seem to have experienced a massive increase in ASD diagnoses in recent years. Newfoundland and Labrador went from 6 to 19.6 per 1,000 — a 227 percent increase, while Prince Edward Island went from 5 to 17.7 per 1,000 — marking a 254 percent increase. Most shocking, however, is the data from Quebec, which shows that ASD diagnoses went from 3.5 to 15.7 per 1,000 — a staggering 349 percent increase.

Vaccine dogma blocks any legitimate scientific analysis that might show vaccine safety to be less than perfect

One health practitioner has dared to speak out, after noticing an undeniable “coincidence” among the provinces: Those with the highest rates of autism also have the highest rates of vaccination.

As Dr. Zimmerman, from British Columbia, notes, there was a report on vaccination coverage in Canadian kids published back in 2013 — just two years before the data for the ASD survey was collected.

And what do you know: At that time, Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest rates of vaccination, while the Yukon had the lowest. Now data also shows that Newfoundland and Labrador have the highest rates of autism, while the Yukon seems to have the lowest. Who would have thought?

While correlation does not always equal causation, the fact of the matter is that this is an association worth investigating. Moreover, countless parents have reported a sudden change in their child post-vaccination — which to any scientist worth their salt, should at least be cause for concern.

Sadly, vaccine dogma has become so ingrained in our society that the very notion of even questioning vaccine safety is seen as an outrageous act of total lunacy. Indeed, those who dare to even suggest that vaccines contain harmful ingredients are labeled as “crackpots,” “conspiracy theorists” and deniers of “real” science. In a truly Orwellian fashion, anyone who posits that vaccines have the potential to harm children is labeled “anti-science.”

In reality, the belief that vaccines are completely innocuous is what’s “anti-science,” as it disregards the mountains of evidence that vaccines can and do harm children every year. Who’s really benefiting from all this vaccine totalitarianism? (Related: Stay up to date on the latest vaccine truths at Vaccines.news or AutismTruthNews.com.)"

The report, drawn up by the Strategic Affairs Delegation (DAS), the intelligence arm of the French Defence Ministry, was quoted in today's edition of the news-letter Le Monde du Renseignement (Intelligence World). Written by a senior officer at the DAS, the report claims agents from the National Security Agency (NSA) helped install secret programmes on Microsoft software, currently in use in 90 per cent of computers. According to the report there was a 'strong suspicion' of a lack of security fed by insistent rumours about the existence of spy programs on Microsoft, and by the presence of NSA personnel in Bill Gates' development teams. The NSA protects communications for the US government, and also intercepts electronic messages for the Defence Department and other US intelligence agencies, the newsletter said. According to the report, 'it would seem that the creation of Microsoft was largely supported, not least financially, by the NSA, and that IBM was made to accept the (Microsoft) MS-DOS operating system by the same administration.' The report claimed the Pentagon was Microsoft's biggest client in the world."

President Donald Trump blasted ""loser"" Joe Biden while speaking to the press on Tuesday, describing the former vice president as ""the weakest mentally"" of all the 2020 Democrats.

Trump said Biden is his preferred challenger in the next presidential election because he appears weaker than other Democratic hopefuls.

“I’d rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody,"" the president declared.

""I think he’s the weakest mentally and I like running against people that are weak mentally.

""I think Joe is the weakest up here,” Trump said pointing to his head.

“The other ones have much more energy.”

Trump also claimed Biden’s campaign could be “in trouble.”

According to the Washington Examiner, Biden has skipped two big Democratic gatherings in the last two weeks.

He has been consistently leading in the polls, however.

The president and Biden are both holding events in Iowa on Tuesday.

Biden is set to give a speech calling Trump an “existential threat” to decency, America’s standing in the world, and democracy.

“When a man has to mention my name 76 times in his speech, that means he’s in trouble,” Trump told reporters before heading to the Midwest.

""Now, I have to tell you, he’s a different guy.

""He looks different than he used to.

""He acts different then he used to.

""He’s even slower than he used to be.

“I heard Biden, who’s a loser, I mean look, Joe never got more than 1% …

""It looks like he’s failing, it looks like his friends from the Left are going to overtake him very soon,” he said.

Ted Cruz prefaced his comments by saying that for the first time, he wanted to say exactly what he thought of Trump after the front-runner suggested Cruz’s father might have had something to do with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

The Texas senator accused Trump of being both disingenuous and self-aggrandizing, saying Trump was a “narcissist” at a level “I don’t think this country has ever seen.” “Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, ‘Dude, what’s your problem?’ ” Cruz said.

Ted Cruz today broke his original promise to not engage in personal attacks and absolutely unloads on Donald Trump. You can hear in Cruz’s voice that he is beyond frustrated and near the breaking point as his campaign grinds to a sure and ignominious end. The people listening to him are stunned into silence at his tirade, they know they are witnessing a mental breakdown.

“Whatever lie he’s telling, in that minute he believes it, Cruz added. “But the man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him.” He criticized Trump for tweeting an unflattering picture of his wife, Heidi Cruz, saying it is just one piece of evidence that Trump is scared of “strong women.”

“It’s why he went after Heidi directly, attacked her and smeared her,” Cruz said. “Heidi isn’t pretty enough for him. … Donald is a bully. … Bullies don’t come from strength, they come from weakness. … There’s a reason Donald builds giant buildings and puts his name on them everywhere he goes.”

“Donald has a real problem with women,” Cruz continued. He then noted that Trump defended boxer Mike Tyson, who was convicted in Indiana on rape charges, and told Trump’s supporters they should not believe their favored candidate.

“Donald is cynically exploiting that anger, and Donald is lying to his supporters,” he said. He went on to insist Trump would betray his them by not doing what he promises, including his pledge to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Cruz’s all-out assault suggested his campaign might be nearing its breaking point.

Now this didn’t go so well:

Are you familiar with those long, white streams of cloudy haze commonly blasted by unmarked airplanes?

Well, apparently, these unusual contrails leave more than just line-shaped clouds behind – as revealed a few years back by Swedish Green Party leader Pernilla Hagberg, these trails, which fail to dissipate like normal contrails do, are actually a toxic mix of chemicals, viruses, and metals collectively referred to as “chemtrails.”

According to Hagberg, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), in cooperation with the Swedish government, aim to modify atmospheric conditions via deliberate aerosol spraying efforts of these trails. Included in this “dangerous” mix of aerosols are various chemical components, viruses and viral fragments, and metals such as aluminum and barium, which have already been shown to be accumulating in water supplies and soils around the world.

Normal contrails, which are composed of mere water vapor that quickly dissipates after emission from jet engines, are far different from chemtrails, which gradually blanket the entire sky in a sea of white. To see what these chemtrails typically look like, check out this video put together by the FreeTruth Show, a YouTube-based radio broadcast.

Interestingly, the United Nations (UN) and various Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-backed groups are trying to defend such sprayings under the guise of saving the planet from the “devastating” effects of global warming.

In the case of chemtrails, everything from blocking the sun in order to lower the earth’s average temperatures, to deliberately shifting weather patterns for the purpose of offsetting the allegedly melting polar ice caps, have been used as excuses for trying to legitimize the seeding of our skies with a variety of poisonous chemicals.

The government's declaration of accounting as 'national security' also suggests secrecy.","Michigan State Economics Professor Mark Skidmore made a stunning discovery late last year. Using publicly available government accounting reports, he revealed there was $21 trillion in what he calls “missing money” from the Department of Defense (DOD) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The data he used has been scrubbed, all accounting records are heavily redacted and now the federal government has declared its accounting falls under “national security.” Dr. Skidmore can no longer get the government to respond. Dr. Skidmore explains, “At this point, they are no longer responding to any of my inquiries. They are just not answering, and that is very astounding . . . and you can go on and look at the report yourself and see all of it blacked out. I actually lost sleep over that. That really bothered me. . . . Now, they are not even using standard accounting financial reporting rules. They are just moving things around and not telling anybody. So, first, all of this stuff is hidden because it is a national security issue, and now they are just changing the accounting standards. I would ask is that constitutional? I don’t think so. Does it match any of our financial reporting laws? I don’t think so. I am not sure what gives the government the authority to make that decision, and, yet, it’s happening.”

The revelation that there is an additional $21 trillion dollars that cannot be accounted for on top of the more than $21 trillion officially in federal debt is an astounding number. It is probably the most important data point since the Federal Reserve was founded in 1913. Dr. Skidmore says, “It’s a huge amount of money to not be able to explain, and they are not explaining it.”

Dr. Skidmore says there is a limit to money printing even when all the global central banks are doing it. Skidmore says, “What does it mean when a central bank is buying equities, or buying debt with printed money in order to suppress interest rates and keep this game going? I think, overall, the whole world is awash in debt, and it’s expanding at a rate that is unsustainable. The only way it has been sustained is that interest rates have been falling for 30 years. Now, interest rates are no longer falling, and we are running up against a constraint. Now, if this $21 trillion in ‘missing’ federal money really represents spending above and beyond what the official records indicate, then that has huge financial implications and huge implications for confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency. This is an enormous priority to address and not just cover up and say we are all good.”

In closing, Dr. Skidmore says, “How can you have a democracy if you don’t have any transparency whatsoever? Having integrity and confidence is so essential to the whole system, and this just puts everything in question. . . . We should clean this up and show we are legitimate. If we don’t, we are just shooting ourselves in the foot.”

 . I'm not somebody who goes to church on a regular basis. The specific elements of Christianity are not something I'm a huge believer in . There's a lot of merit in the moral aspects of religion. I think it can have a very, very positive impact.



Frost: I sometimes say to people, do you believe there is a god, or do you know there is a god? And, you'd say you don't know?

 In terms of doing things I take a fairly scientific approach to why things happen and how they happen. I don't know if there's a god or not , but I think religious principles are quite valid. Gates was profiled by Walter Isaacson in a January 13, 1996 TIME MAGAZINE cover story. Here are some excerpts compiled by the Drudge Report: Isn't there something special, perhaps even divine, about the human soul? I don't have any evidence on that.

“Gates face suddenly becomes expressionless,” writes Isaacson, ""his squeaky voice turns toneless, and he folds his arms across his belly and vigorously rocks back and forth in a mannerism that has become so mimicked at MICROSOFT that a meeting there can resemble a round table of ecstatic rabbis.""

The prophet Daniel would say to these men the same thing he said to king Belshazzar, “...the God in whose hand , and whose are all thy ways, ” (Daniel 5:23). We read again in Romans 1:21, “...when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.” “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your MISERIES THAT SHALL COME UPON YOU.

There is a lot of conspiracy theory being generated about the nascent 5G cell phone technology that has come online now in California and soon to the rest of the country. Some of it is hype and nothing more, but as is the case with the vast majority of conspiracy theory, there is a lot of truth to it as well.

As a kid growing up in the 1970’s, I can well remember the cigarette ads in magazines touting the virtues and benefits of smoking cigarettes. The tobacco companies denied for years that there was any link between smoking and cancer, and the US government backed them up because it was big business and everyone was making obscene amounts of money. But cigarettes and smoking does indeed cause cancer, all packs contain those warnings. On a personal note, both my parents died of stage 4 lung cancer caused by years of smoking the cigarettes doctors told them were OK. Now apply this same logic to cell phones, wifi and 5G cell phone towers.

Our mobile devices operate through microwave radiation, and that can be deadly. You should NEVER talk more than a few minutes on any mobile device with the device pressed against your ear. And guess what? Bluetooth wireless earbuds also use microwave radiation to transmit the signal, and you should never use those either.

A personal friend of mine, Doris, told me the story of what happened to her husband and brother. The two of them were great friends, and would talk to each other on their rides into work on separate trains in the morning and again in the evening coming home. Doris’ husband held the phone on the left side of his head, and her brother held his on the right side. After a few years of that, Doris’ husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor on the left side of his head and died. Her brother was diagnosed with a brain tumor on the right side of his head, is still alive, but the tumor is inoperable. You will risk the same fate with either a cell phone or wireless earbuds on the sides of your head.

5G cell phone towers and signals may not live up to the deadly hype we read about online, but neither should you take it lightly either. Now, about those dead bees…

Hundreds of bees drop dead around 5G cell phone towers in California

FROM THE DAILY STAR UK: The superfast broadband has sparked controversy since rolling out this year, with health experts claiming it could have serious side effects on humans. And there are now claims online that bees could also be affected after a video went viral. The clip – taken in Sierra Madre, California – shows the lifeless bodies of the bees lying on the ground.

But others questioned what was seen in the clip. Some pointed out the bees could just be drone bees – which die after mating. Others claimed the poles could not be holding 5G broadband, with one saying: “5G has only been installed in major cities, dude. It’s not in Sierra Madre and it probably never will be.”

After a powerful 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck California last month, thousands of the creatures were filmed covering the streets.

While the real reason for the sight is hard to explain, scientists have often noted how animals and insects can act strangely in the lead-up to an earthquake.

One study in Northern Taiwan that monitored insect populations over a period when a 7.3 and 6.8 earthquake hit, noted ‘large declines’ in the number of individual insects and also individual species. READ MORE

Two deaths on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 were not initially thought to have been COVID-19-related, but further testing has revealed that they were, the county medical examiner said Tuesday.

“Today, the Medical Examiner-Coroner received confirmation from the CDC that tissue samples from both cases are positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19),” the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner said in a statement.

A fatality reported by officials in Washington state Feb. 29 was initially thought to be the earliest U.S. death from the novel coronavirus.

News of the earlier deaths comes as the total number of U.S. fatalities from the coronavirus surpassed 44,000, among more than 800,000 confirmed cases. California now has over 35,000 cases with 1,288 deaths.

Santa Clara County officials said that the two deaths in February, and one on March 9, were not initially attributed to the coronavirus as the people died at home at a time when only very limited testing was available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“Testing criteria set by the CDC at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms,” the county examiner-coroner’s statement said.

Testing has since greatly expanded, with the U.S. having now run 4.1 million tests, about one for every 80 people. Antibody studies in some areas of the country are also beginning to paint a picture of the scope of the disease."

A handful of candidates are presented, about five to avoid confusion, and from these lucky few, a personable performer is chosen. Usually one destined to fuck up in the big game. And in the ensuing four years, eight years if the pre-selected president performs according to script, the New World Order will continue on its merry way, as it has for nearly a century. Rewarding those who follow orders, punishing those who follow their consciences. Should that pre-selected president ever decide to act, suddenly and irrationally, in the interest of fairness or for the public good, woe be to he or she.

Because a well-initiated, pre-programmed president is less likely to fuck up the global agenda. Thus, at this moment, numerous Council on Foreign Relations members are working weekends and nights to insure you receive the best president they can find. No loose cannons, reformers or idealists, thank you. To their credit they've offered many variations of the same model. Clinton is McCain in drag and Giuliani is Clinton with chin whiskers and testicles but no balls. As odious as the offerings appear to be, they all present some (minor) risk to the elites pulling the strings. Suppose, just for a moment, the ""winner"" actually decides to oppose his or her masters and act presidential. A network of planners would be required to draw up contingency plans. A patsy with three names would have to be found. A suitable location would have to be selected. Some top snipers would have to be contracted. Several top intelligence officials would have to be informed. A handful of big bankers would have to shift funds to offshore accounts. A smattering of media big shots would have to be presented with the official story beforehand. All these things take time and create headaches for the elites. So whenever the top insiders at AIPAC or the CFR or the Federal Reserve meet with Rudy or Hillary, they get multiple assurances (probably in writing) that nothing they do for the next four years---if selected--will run contrary to the global blueprint of their group. The rewards for following orders are certainly tempting. Just look at the big book deals and speaking fees for those who never deviated from the globalist agenda. Thus we now see why Obama must shuck and jive like a plantation field hand before his masters. Just as Colin Powell did at the UN. Black candidates must shuck and jive, just like white ones. Even the whitest candidates of all, Edwards and McCain, must shuck and jive like Steppen Fetchit to the plantation owners of the New World Order. That is why Little-Miss-Stand-By Your-Man, Hillary Clinton pimps for war, much like McCain, and why her gal pal, fellow Dem Pelosi, licks ass over at the AIPAC convention, rather than kicks ass for her constituents. Whether white or black, ALL are owned. No candidate, whatever their party affiliation, may be anointed unless they have proven their loyalty to the powers behind the throne. They do that by voting for the NWO agenda whenever possible. Whether voting for the PATRIOT Act or voting for endless (and profitable) war on terror, ALL the anointed candidates must serve the Order by following orders, public be damned. Forget what these candidates say to common folk in public. Forget televised speeches. Whatever well-meaning nonsense they spout in public speeches, as ""sound bites,"" does not diminish their loyalty to Bonesmen or Zionists or Wall Street bankers. The elites know this well--it's all part of the script--but most folks fall for the public lies. That was why GWB sounded (almost) like a sincere, non-threatening country bumpkin in the fall of 2000, rather than an immoral, trigger happy, megalomaniac in the years since. Those were all well known qualities to the New World Order mentors who groomed both father and son years, probably decades, in advance.

A new formula, formed by a Vatican panel of experts, substitutes ""psychological disturbance"" for references to the Devil as the embodiment of evil. ""In revising the form of words for exorcism, we have re-thought the nature of the evil we are trying to root out,"" one member of the commission tells the Times. Officials say the Church isn't revising ""scriptural references"" to the Devil or suggesting that people should cease believing in ""the Evil One."" But priests conducting exorcisms should deal with evil as a force ""lurking within all individuals"" instead of one that threatens people from without. Definitions of ""demonic possession"" and the rituals for dealing with it have remained little changed since Pope Paul V issued the Rituale Romanum in 1614. Monsignor Corrado Balducci, the Vatican's chief exorcist, says the Church has to adapt to modern thinking and ""be more careful in distinguishing between possession by evil spirits and what are more commonly called psychiatric disturbances."" According to Vatican officials, priests will be encouraged not to refer any longer to the Prince of Darkness, the Accursed Dragon, the Foul Spirit, the Satanic Power or the Master of Deceit. Instead the formulas refer to ""the cause of evil."" Both Old and New Testaments refer to Beelzebub, the Evil One, or Satan, with the Devil often depicted as Lucifer, a rebel angel expelled from Heaven. The Revelation of St. John (xii.7) describes ""war in Heaven between the angels,"" and ""the Dragon, that ancient serpent who led the whole world astray whose name is the Devil, or Satan."" Jesus cast out demons in several famous New Testament passages; St. Mark and St. Matthew both record that Jesus was ""tempted by Satan"" during his 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness. But some modern theologians regard the depiction of Satan as a reptilian beast with cloven hooves, wings and a tail, as a medieval invention, and prefer St. Augustine's definition of evil as ""the absence of good."""

Money has been moving like lava through the economy for almost two months now amid the coronavirus shutdowns resulting in millions of layoffs, which some bank officials like J.P. Morgan’s Bob Michele, say will keep unemployment high for at least a decade. The bleak prediction comes as the April jobs report, published today, reported that 20.5 million people joined the ranks of the unemployed. If we consider a study done by the Economic Policy Institute, the real figure could be twice larger.

Meanwhile, mortgage lending has slowed to a standstill as credit availability tanked 26 percent since February and laid-off workers around the country are finding they make more money collecting unemployment than cashing their payroll check. Michele speculated about what might happen “when Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) runs out of money”, venturing that curbed consumer spending will cause even more layoffs in the near future.

But the dangers of an exceptionally slowed-down U.S. economy can and is already starting to have an acute effect on the rest of the world. Brazilian Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, warned yesterday of an “economic collapse” as a result of the measures put in place to stem the coronavirus outbreak. The sudden downturn has left Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s plan to “re-start” Brazil’s economy in the dust, as the IMF predicts a 5.3 percent contraction to the Brazilian economy this year.

A brief emitted and updated on May 4 by the UN’s Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), projects that developing countries, especially in Latin America and Eurasia, will be the “hardest hit” by the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Tellingly, the brief includes a study showing “unprecedented outflows of capital from emerging economies” into the coffers of the first world.

As jobs disappear and our everyday lives are disrupted in the name of flattening the curve of the coronavirus WHO-declared pandemic, a picture of what tomorrow will look like is still too uncertain to make out, but all indications show that we are close to a breaking point.

No Jobs and no credit

In a “series of economic briefings” leading up to President Donald Trump’s decision to scrap the CDC’s reopening guidelines yesterday, the President was warned that up to “50 percent of the country’s small businesses” could disappear.

Mortgage lending has also come to a standstill, as banks get stricter on lending terms and reserve the toughest rules for Fannie & Freddie Mac loans. J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo, two of the usual suspects in this century’s financial scandals, are requiring prime credit scores of 700 or above and, in the case of JPM, a 20 percent down payment on the home price. Indeed, our too-big-to-fail financial institutions who benefited so egregiously in the 2008 bailouts are once again mitigating their risk on our dime, but this time before the crash actually happens.

As reported by Bloomberg, lenders are imposing “restrictions” on the way they disburse the $2.2 trillion just handed to them by Congress in the March stimulus bill. Bloomberg also hints that these limits are being applied to “regular refinances” as well. The pause in the movement of money extends all the way to the open sea, where both empty cruise-line vessels and offshore bank accounts are in a holding pattern.

An astonishing $4.77 trillion in cash is sitting in tax havens around the world, most of it tied to U.S. Treasury bonds and other low-risk investments with no intention of going anywhere else. Fund managers are closing off funds to new investors in order to maximize returns of those already in a particular fund as margins get razor-thin. Insiders acknowledge that “there’s going to be some pain that’s felt both by clients and fund managers.”

For the rest of us, the uncertainty is many times greater than the worries of money managers and their extremely wealthy clientele. The nation’s largest mall operator, SIMON, announced that they would be reopening 49 shopping centers with new post-coronavirus mall guidelines for visitors, encouraging people to wear masks and imposing social distancing rules.

Such a day-to-day reality is unlikely to spur much consumer spending or even socializing in bars and restaurants, ramping up the pressure on the most economically vulnerable among us who work in the service sector. Trump’s briefings on the reopening of the country calculated that the pain on main street would still be felt through the fall and aides acknowledged that it would be “brutal” for millions of Americans.

As trillions of dollars are allocated to financial institutions unwilling to part with any of it and asset-holders try to ride it out, regular people’s jobs are quickly vanishing and with no return-date on them. And if Brazil is any indication, the problem is about to spread faster and wider than the coronavirus ever could.

Another night, another Democratic debate, and the winner still is Donald Trump. Mini Mike Bloomberg looked like a deer in the headlights,and was the punching bag of the group. He is short in stature, and one of the most uninspired, boring speakers you will ever hear. Think of Pope Francis but with a New York accent. His billions will win him nothing, last night proved that.

Moving on to the rest of the candidates, it was a take-your-pick between the gay guy, the pretend Indian, the Communist, the hair sniffer, and Amy Klobuchar who doesn’t really register as much of anything. I have no adjective to apply to her as I did to the others, so is that a weakness, or a strength? Hard to say. But through it all the one constant was Donald Trump, who was in everyone’s heads, and a constant reminder that the Democrats still at this late date don’t have a “Trump killer“, and that’s the real story of last night’s Democratic debate. You will be greatly amused by the video at the bottom of the page.

The winners and losers at Wednesday’s Democratic debate in Nevada showed Trump is still winning

FROM THE NY POST: Sen. Elizabeth Warren desperately needed a major win to breathe new life into her flagging presidential campaign — and scored it Wednesday night by delivering blow after blow against Michael Bloomberg, Post debate expert Karen Hinton said.

While Warren wasn’t the only candidate hitting Bloomberg during the feisty forum, she was the most effective thanks to her extensive knowledge of his history as a media mogul and New York City mayor.

The tough performance lends new credibility to her campaign, which has struggled to regain its footing after disappointing results in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.

“She showed the talent that she has for really taking on tough issues and that she can take on high-powered men like Bloomberg — and Trump,” she added. “She said ‘don’t’ discount me, I’m here and I can handle these Masters of the Universe’.”

Meanwhile, the two-hour-long forum left New York’s last mayor badly battered by reminding Democratic primary voters about much-criticized parts of his tenure at City Hall, including his vociferous support for the controversial stop-and-frisk policing strategy.

Joe Biden: He hasn’t given up. Biden was combative and didn’t hesitate to take credit for better health care and ending stop-and-frisk. He has to keep punching, otherwise another moderate — like Bloomberg — will take his place.

Sen. Bernie Sanders: He’s got to win the swing states, and I didn’t hear those voters in his voice or see them in his body language. I have never heard them, even though I support many of Sanders’ positions.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren: She wanted to regain her lead and she did. She offered sharp policy statements and showcased her legal talents by hammering Bloomberg over his nondisclosure agreements with harassment victims.

Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg: He looks and sounds perfect almost all the time, but his blistering exchanges with Sen. Amy Klobuchar did little to dispel the notion he’s too inexperienced for the job.

Former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg: He was overwhelmed by the attacks from opponents, who hit him over allegations of sexism at his company and racially biased policing strategies as mayor. He didn’t survive.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar: In many ways, she is the best candidate we have. She was articulate, full of good ideas and tough. I don’t see any downsides for her, except she is a woman.

It questions whether this is predictive programming or a coincidence.,False,There is no explicit mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead the public in the article.,"A strange comic book that was commissioned for publication by the European Union in 2012 eerily predicted almost exactly what has unfolded with the Covid-19 global pandemic. However, in this propaganda laced presentation of the outbreak, unelected globalist bureaucrats save the planet.

The comic book, titled ‘Infected’, was a production of the European Commission’s international cooperation and development arm. It was not intended for widespread public consumption, but instead to be distributed inside EU institutions. Only a few hundred of the comic books were made.

The EU’s description of the strange publication states that “While the story may be fictional, it is nevertheless intertwined with some factual information.”

The graphic novel depicts scientists inside a lab in China experimenting with deadly pathogens:

A wannabe hero time travels from the future, alerting authorities to the coming pandemic, and presents an antidote, before quickly becoming the target of opportunists who want to steal the cure and sell it to drug companies:

The story features the transmission of a novel virus from animals to humans in a crowded wet market:

“Indeed, imagine if you were infected in this market by a new contagious agent.” says the UN’s chief advisor on contagious diseases, adding “You probably wouldn’t even realise it until the end of the incubation period.”

The publication suggests that air travel would exacerbate the spread of the disease, with the character adding that “You’d have headed back to Europe, the US, Latin America, or Australia as planned via an international airport.”

The cartoon depicts the failure of a global health organisation to act quickly enough to stop a pandemic:

It also predicts draconian safety measures, including social distancing, which make everyday life “totally unbearable”:

The piece concludes with an EU Parliament hearing, in which Brussels pushes for more integrated European cooperation on global health matters, mirroring a real life initiative known as ‘One health’.

The globalists are lauded for helping develop and distribute a vaccine to the world:

Was this predictive programming or just a bizarre coincidence?

In 2020, in reality, the EU has pandered to China, and bowed to censorship regarding the virus outbreak.

The EU has also been heavily criticised by member states and insiders for monumental failings owing to internal bureaucracy. The EU’s science chief even resigned due to the inept coronavirus response from the institution.

In the Eurocrats’ own fiction, globalism saves the planet. In reality, it ends in mass death and global tyranny.

Iraqi Gen. Mohammed al-Quraishi confirmed to CNN that the town fell to Sunni rebels. Tal Afar is located in the Nineveh province and has a population of about 80,000 people, most of whom are Iraqi Turkmen.

The militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS/ISIL) overran the town after fighting with security forces, several people in Tal Araf told Reuters over the phone.

Sunni insurgents led by ISIS jihadists captured the northwestern Iraqi town of Tal Afar on Sunday, reports say, as the militants continue their advance on Baghdad. The US says it is relocating some of its embassy staff to other Iraqi cities.

Meanwhile the US is increasing security at its embassy in Baghdad, the US State Department said, adding that some personnel will be moved out of the capital.

“Some additional US government security personnel will be added to the staff in Baghdad; other staff will be temporarily relocated – both to our Consulate Generals in Basra and Arbil and to the Iraq Support Unit in Amman,” the statement said. However, the “substantial majority” of embassy staff will remain in Iraq.

A US official speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters that less than 100 US Marines and other military personnel are headed to Iraq to reinforce security at the Baghdad embassy.

“The Embassy of the United States in Baghdad remains open and will continue to engage daily with Iraqis and their elected leaders — supporting them as they strengthen Iraq’s constitutional processes and defend themselves from imminent threats,” State Department spokeswoman said in a statement.

Meanwhile, US citizens have been advised to limit travel in five Iraqi provinces, including Anbar and Kirkuk.

On Saturday, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered that the USS aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush be moved to the Persian Gulf in case Washington decides to use military force in Iraq to help fight ISIS.

ISIS insurgents managed to seize the Iraqi cities of Mosul and Tikrit with an estimated 7,000-strong force. On Friday, Shia fighters attempted to counter ISIS momentum near Muqdadiya, just 80 km (50 miles) from Baghdad’s city limits.

The UN said ISIS forces have carried out summary executions and rapes as the group battles to take over the country.

Once an offshoot of Al-Qaeda, the hyper-fundamentalist group active in Iraq and Syria fell out with the global terrorist network. It gained notoriety for its ruthless tactics, which include publicly crucifying and beheading those who violate their strict religious interpretations.

Iraq came under the influence of a Shia-majority government after the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein’s Sunni-dominated regime in 2003. Since the withdrawal of US troops in 2011, sectarian tensions have boiled over, resulting in Sunni insurgents increasingly waging war against the central government."

If a corporation is a “person” – and I understand that even governments now are corporations – and a “person” has a moral and legal obligation to do no harm, then yes, a corporation as well has a moral and legal duty to do no harm. If corporate employees – including government employees – were to be held equally accountable for the “sins” of the corporation, then we would see a rapid improvement in the moral standards of all corporations. Not one good employee would cooperate with corruption and every corporation would dismiss anyone – from a secretary to the CEO – who suggested placing corporate profits over the wellbeing of either the corporation or the public.

Any action from these traitors?

So who is behind the failed coup? We all know here at the American Intelligence Media, but will have to wait for the Limbaughs, Hannitys, and Pirros of the fake news world to catch up and start producing REAL NEWS. It was British espionage and American treason. Please, stop with all the sugar coating and start reporting ALL of the news!

Why hasn’t the very popular Judge Pirro reported on Alison Saunders’ Dinner with the Ohrs? Why hasn’t Rush reported on Sir Richard Dearlove and Geoffrey Pattie’s role in the coup? Why is Hannity always so far behind the narrative…he hasn’t even reported on the relationship that Robert Mueller had with British Arvinder Sambei from 911- right up to the special council?

Why aren’t any of them interested in Ruth Ginsberg’s disappearance…or Dianne Feinstein’s Chinese spying operation or her husband’s involvement with AVID ISIS management used in the corporate media for reading propaganda to the people?

The timing seems very suspicious to us. Has the look and feel of a false flag… so patriots will want to pay attention to the story with a discerning eye. For example in the footage below we see a person who resembles an aged Julian coming out of the embassy. That could easily be Hollywood mask and makeup on a crisis actor.

Before we tell you what

Is the Privy Council in a panic and using this arrest as a distraction? We know their M.O. – .

we think about this incident, why do you think all of this is happening now…just when POTUS starts talking about treason and a coup and is asking

Even the book that “Julian” is holding (image to right) looks like it has been photoshopped in the picture.

Be vigilant. We are fighting the Great Information War and the British rulers and elite are using their Tavistock propaganda crap on the world to protect their royal turkey butts. (Sorry, that was a little ‘Tallahassee talk’ from Betsy who wonders if anyone, anywhere is going to start reporting the British espionage. Aren’t we paying Gina Haspel and Christopher Wray to get this intel to the president’s desk?)

Psstt…any Aim Patriots in Britain want to let the Queen know that we all know what she and the Privy Council did to our beloved Donald Trump?

Papa POTUS isn’t going to be happy when he finds out that the British Privy Council was behind the attempted overthrow of a United States president. That’s called international espionage….Sorta like all those British James Bond 007 movies.

We might have to come over there and open up a can of American whoop ass on those monarchs and oligarchs that have been ruining your country for centuries. They are all war actors against the United States of America. They will never be able to walk back the truth.

The upside would be that the British people would be free to run their country for the people, by the people, instead of being subjects to the lizard families.

By the way, has anybody seen Arvinder Sambei around? And where is Saboteur Saunders these days?

It’s an information war and Rep. Gaetz is leading the charge with congressional memes like this! He actually “memed” the legislation. Great job, AIM Patriot Matt.

Has Ruth Ginsberg Been Replaced with a Crisis Actress?

Why is the mainstream media silent on Ruth’s condition? Why aren’t they at the Supreme Court every day reporting on the viability of this once very sick, probably now very dead, Supreme Court justice?

That transaction followed a spate of bad news for Merck’s flagship Gardasil vaccine.

Last month, Cancer Research UK announced an alarming 54% rise in cervical cancer among 24-29-year-olds, the first generation to receive the HPV jabs. The following day, the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine published a withering critique of Gardasil’s crooked clinical trials, “It is still uncertain whether human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination prevents cervical cancer as trials were not designed to detect this outcome.”
• 700 women in Colombia vaccinated with Gardasil sue Merck for $160 million: Researcher advises girls in Armenia to understand the risks

As Gerberding knows, those trials revealed that Gardasil dramatically RAISES (by +44.6%) the risk of cervical cancer among women with a current infection or those previously exposed to HPV. That may explain the cancer explosions in England and other nations with high inoculation rates in young girls up to age 18; Australia, Spain, Sweden and Norway. A 2019 study of Alabama girls found the highest cervical cancer rates in the state’s most heavily vaccinated counties.
• Parents whose son died after Gardasil Vaccine in August just spoke at the CDC

With Merck’s efficacy pretensions circling the drain, a coalition of leading plaintiff’s lawyers are already in discovery in a suit alleging that Merck fraudulently concealed serious illnesses affecting half, and autoimmune diseases affecting 1 of every 37 girls in Gardasil’s clinical trials within 6 months of injection.

As Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director from 2002-2009, Gerberding helped Merck paper over these efficacy and safety problems. In 2006 she gave Merck the CDC recommendation that made Gardasil a $5 Billion blockbuster. Gerberding did other lucrative favors for Merck; blocking whistleblower Gary Goldman from disclosing that Merck’s chicken pox vaccine was causing a deadly shingles epidemic, silencing and punishing whistleblower Dr. William Thompson when he told her that CDC bigwigs were destroying data linking Merck’s MMR to autism, and allowing the company to illegally reformulate its MMR mumps component. Those courtesies earned her the Merck sinecure and stock options.

Merck is now fighting existential fraud lawsuits on both the MMR and Gardasil vaccines, that threaten licensing for those key products. Fat rats are always the first to jump ship.

“Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,” stressed WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a conference call with reporters from Geneva on Monday.

In its latest report, the organization estimates over 109,000 COVID-19 cases and over 3,800 deaths worldwide as of press time. In China, where the virus originated in December, health officials have noted a decrease in the number of infections. However, other regions have reported an upswing in cases, with current figures indicating 104 countries reporting COVID-19 cases. In particular, Korea has reported 248 new cases, bringing its total to 7,382 – the most number of cases outside China, while Italy and Iran follow closely with 7,375 and 6,566 cases, respectively.

According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. now has over 560 cases spread across 30 states since last week.

While the WHO still does not consider the coronavirus as a global pandemic, officials say that they are closer to making the declaration. Currently, the WHO has identified four countries – China, South Korea, Iran and Italy – which account for 93 percent of all COVID-19 cases worldwide.

“When you reach 100 countries and when you reach 100,000 cases, it is time to step back and think, two weeks ago it was 30 countries,” added Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director for the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.

Despite this, Dr. Tedros stressed that it’s early for world leaders to give up, saying the only a handful of countries have “signs of sustained community transmission.” For instance, China and Singapore have reportedly contained the spread in their countries. The latter, in particular, has reported 70 percent of all confirmed cases to be recovered, indicated a potential end to the outbreak in the region.

“China is bringing its epidemic under control,” Dr. Tedros added.

For other countries, however, Ryan said that it’s still too soon to tell, indicating that some countries have just begun to receive their first cases.

“We’re still very much in the [upcycle] of this epidemic, and there are still a number of miles to go,” he noted.

Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them.

After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.

It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Trump Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.

Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.

State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.

The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.

On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.”

He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.

Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5,000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast,

 tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?

If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.

The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?

That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms.

When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back.

In the midst of a medical “crisis,” they will do everything in their power to politicize the coronavirus to take down President Trump.

This is why you can NEVER work with these people to solve any problem. There is no middle ground with them. No “reaching across the aisle.”

They will not be satisfied until President Trump is done and they are back in charge. NEVER.

On Friday Washington State Governor Jay Inslee tweeted the following:

“I just received a call from @VP Mike Pence, thanking Washington state for our efforts to combat the coronavirus.

I told him our work would be more successful if the Trump administration stuck to the science and told the truth.“

One day after Gov. Inslee’s tweet, the first coronavirus death was confirmed in the U.S. which happened in King County, Washington. Later in the day, Gov. Inslee declared a state of emergency over the virus, as two more King County cases have emerged. Three confirmed cases and it’s a state of emergency.

392,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions criminal Federal Reserve bankers, greedy corporate owners, treasonous politicians, and massage therapists as actors.",True,"The article discusses the actions of criminal Federal Reserve bankers, greedy corporate owners, treasonous politicians, and people getting massages.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"As America's economy continues to be flushed down the toilet by criminal Federal Reserve bankers, greedy corporate owners, and treasonous politicians; the massage therapy business is booming, because there's no real jobs left for Americans to work. Hence, the issue needs to be addressed from a Christian perspective.

The word “therapy” is misleading. What it should be called is sexually stimulating people, because that is what's being done. It is sinful to “body massage” someone to whom you are not married, or to allow them to body massage you. We're not talking about a neck message, or a foot massage. The advertisement are for a full-body massage. It is sinful. No one should be massaging another person's body to whom they are not married. There is so much evil in society today that people just don't care anymore.
• Women get abortions because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• People, especially women, get divorced because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• People get body massages because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• People watch filthy movies because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• Women act in bed scenes for Hollywood because ...“everybody else is doing it.”
• People go commit evil in Las Vegas because... “everybody else is doing it.”
• Women dress like whores because... “everybody else is doing it.”

We'll, God's children WHO LOVE JESUS CHRIST are NOT doing it; and those who do will face the harsh judgment of God in eternity. Colossians 3:5-6 plainly lists several sexual sins that bring the judgment of God, “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence [evil sexual desire], and covetousness, which is idolatry: For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.” America is a sex-sicko society. People are surrounded by sex everywhere they turn: TV shows, commercials, bus ads, internet ads, Hollywood movies, so-called Christian movies, et cetera.

The Bible tells us that the world was indulging in eating, drinking, and marrying in the days of Noah, before the flood (Matthew 24:37-38). The Bible says that they “knew not until the flood came, and took them all away.” Eating, drinking and marrying is not sinful by itself; unless you are ignoring God in your life. Those people in Noah's day ignored the preaching of Noah, didn't care about the things of God, didn't desire to know or obey THE TRUTH; and so they all died in their sins and went straight to Hell. Most Americans are spoiled rotten, enjoying fine-dining, massage parlors, hot-tubs, steam-rooms, Jacuzzis, Lazy Boy recliners, giant flat-screen TV's, surround sound; but they don't care about God. They will enjoy the cares, riches and pleasures of this life for a time; but they will be very regretful and sorry the day they die.

I was listening to a very popular radio host one day, who claims to be a Christian. He claims to deeply love God in every way. He is married with children. Yet one day I heard him tell his listeners that he goes to massage parlors from time-to-time, to have beautiful women massage him. I was saddened when he said that, wondering what kind of wife didn't care if her husband went to be massaged by other women. God is a jealous God, and something is wrong with anyone who is not jealous over their spouse. In America's sicko society today, where married couples “swing” with other couples sexually, it is horribly evil.

Only in a sinful, carnally-minded society do people go get a massage, letting someone of the opposite sex usually) put their hands all over you from head-to-toe. It is just plain wrong.

When I hear someone say that they're going to get a massage, I know that they're not right with God. Oh, I know, everyone has a bad back, or a bad leg, or some other health problem that they use to justify getting a massage; but it doesn't matter. It is sinfully for a man to have a woman putting her hands all over him (unless it's his wife). Massages are unscriptural and sinful, because they potentially arouse sexual desires (at least in a healthy, normal man) and often lead to sexual immorality during the massage. God calls all believers to a life of holiness.

A wife who doesn't mind if her husband gets a massage by another woman; probably dresses like a whore, has a loose past of fornication, approves of abortion, accepts homosexuality, et cetera. Only an immoral wife would approve of her husband getting a massage by another woman. You should be jealous over your spouse, just as God is jealous over His own (Exodus 20:1-5).

Massages are sinful. No one should touch you except your spouse. Even a man touching a man is creepy. No man should massage another man."

In a statement on Twitter, the “Planned Parenthood Keystone” account called on the animation company to expose children to numerous left-leaning themes.

The tweet, which received only 40 retweets, was deleted shortly after as both supporters and opponents of the organization voiced their concerns.

“Disney princesses are for CHILDREN and these are adult issues. Jesus,” one supporter said. “This far-out crap is why we got stuck with Donald Trump.”

Others likewise pushed back against the group’s demand prior to the tweet being deleted.

Those opposed to Planned Parenthood also weighed in, both mocking and criticizing the political tweet.

“We need a Disney princess who uses her royal authority to defund you stupid a**holes,” the Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro said.

“A trans princess who is an illegal immigrant union worker who has had an abortion. Kids will love it!” another joked.

Twitter users quickly turned the tweet into a meme, offering up suggestions on what kind of Disney princesses are needed.

As of publication, Planned Parenthood has not commented on the deleted tweet.

Trump: ‘A Free Society Cannot Allow Social Media Giants to Silence’ Free Speech

“We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control,” said the President. “Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty.”

“A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power, over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say,” he continued.

“A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive and defiant of the will of the people. A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule. Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions and values.”

“In the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.”

“A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people. And a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling or blacklisting their own neighbors.”

“President Donald Trump: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike.”

Willie contends, “Here’s the big, big consequence. The U.S. is basically telling Europe you have two choices here. Join us with the war against Russia. Join us with the sanctions against Russia. Join us in constant war and conflicts, isolation and destruction to your economy and denial of your energy supply and removal of contracts. Join us with this war and sanctions because we’d really like you to keep the dollar regime going. They are going to say were tired of the dollar. . . . We are pushing Germany. Don’t worry about France, don’t worry about England, worry about Germany. Germany has 3,000 companies doing active business right now. They are not going to join the sanctions—period.”

Willie goes on to say, “It’s a war game and Europe is sick of U.S. war games. The defense of the dollar has come to war versus trade. Are you with us or are you against us?” As far as the NSA spying on Germany, Willie says, “I think they are looking for details on assisting Russia on dumping the dollar. I think they are looking for details for a secret movement for Germany to get away from the dollar and join the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.) This is exactly what I think they are going to do.”

Willie thinks as countries move away from the U.S. dollar, the money printing (quantitative easing, QE) increases, and the economy gets worse. Willie calls this a “feedback loop” that he contends, “You get the feedback loop from the damage of lost income that comes from the higher costs that comes from QE. It’s not stimulus, people. It’s a back door Wall Street bailout that degrades, deteriorates and damages the economy in a feedback vicious system. . . . You are seeing the free-fall and acceleration of the damage; and, so now, you get even more cost damage. QE didn’t happen by accident. Foreigners didn’t want to buy the Treasuries anymore. They don’t want to buy a bond where the same central bank is printing money to buy the bond! QE raises the cost structure and brings about shrinkage and disappearance of profits. QE is not stimulus. It’s capital destruction. ”

On the so-called “recovery” the mainstream media has been harping on for years, Willie says, “I believe the U.S. has gone into a recession that it is not going to get out of until the dollar is gone. When you factor inflation in properly . . . we got a monster recession of -6% or -7% right now. I don’t think it will get better until the dollar is disposed of. So, we’re entering the final phase of the dollar.”

In closing, Willie says, “You want to get rid of political obstacles? Go straight to commerce and trade. Why is it that Exxon Mobil is still doing projects in the Artic and still doing projects in the Black Sea, which is Crimea, with the Russians and their energy companies? We already got the U.S. energy companies defying our own sanctions, and yet we are prosecuting French banks for doing the same thing. This is insane. We are losing control.

Contrary to what the propaganda-spreading World Health Organization (WHO) purports, modern day vaccines are responsible for more deaths than the diseases they are intended to create immunity against. This is a fact based on sound science. Let’s review some examples, and then we’ll discuss shedding – the common way infectious diseases are spread by children and teens during the first two weeks after they are injected with multiple strains of diseases, when their own immune systems are severely compromised, as are the other vaccinated children around them.

First off, there have been 127 deaths caused by the measles vaccine in the past 15 years, but only 2 deaths caused by the measles disease itself. Secondly, just take a look at GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK) 6-in-1 jab called “Infanrix Hexa” (meaning six diseases are injected into a baby’s muscle tissue all at once – a science phenomena no studies have ever shown to be safe).

That toxic GSK hexa-jab has killed three dozen infants already, and over 2,000 reports have flooded in regarding adverse reactions (of which 500 were termed “serious”). This immunization combo is deadly, but the mass media has buried these reports, as usual, so hardly a soul knows to avoid this shot like the modern-day plague.

Then there’s the most toxic and deadly vaccine of all – the influenza vaccine, a.k.a. the flu shot. Damage from the flu shot is responsible for the majority of the secretive vaccine court’s payouts in settlements that have breached a mind-blowing (pun intended) $4 billion (the number increased vastly since 2016). Yes, you read that right.

Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary ""sulforaphane"" and ""glucosinolate"" nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.

Recently, a Las Vegas man became paralyzed and blind the day after he got the flu jab. Could it be because many flu shots still contain up to 50 parts per million (ppm) of mercury, listed as “thimerosal?” The guy was perfectly healthy before he got the vaccine. Now he can’t breathe, speak, or walk on his own anymore. Is the vaccine worth the risk? Most people with even a partially functional immune system can beat the flu in a few days.

No doubt the flu vaccine itself is a global health threat, especially since the CDC recommends it for pregnant women. Is there a coupon in the vaccine insert for Planned Parenthood that comes with that jab? If so, New York State will be the first to offer that deal.

Folks, “safety in numbers” is a myth. You think it’s safe for your babies to sit and wait with you in a doctor’s office waiting room, playing with germ-laden toys, while everyone around you is contaminated with the flu, hepatitis B, and other viruses they’re shedding from the vaccines they recently got jabbed into their muscle tissue?

All vaccine proponents always blame unvaccinated children or teens when a disease starts spreading around a school, theme park, or college. Why? That’s what they hear on TV, read in the MSM lying newspapers, or heard from their doctor or nurse, who got the script straight from Big Pharma.

It’s all fear-based propaganda to sell more toxic vaccines. Now the World Health Organization is spreading hyper-propaganda about the unvaccinated people of the world being one of the greatest health threats to society, when actually the opposite is the case.

Watch this short video and learn why you should fear vaccines and the vaccinated children much more than you should ever worry about the people who avoid getting those toxic jabs:

Stop putting your trust in a medical society that profits greatly from you and your family’s sicknesses, and makes zero money from your good health. It’s just common sense. Are you the sheeple in the herd that’s spreading the diseases you’re so afraid to get – the very ones that are swimming in your blood and shedding from your mucus and saliva right now?

The most dangerous time for spreading infectious disease is the first 14 days after a person is injected with that immunization that contains genetically modified versions of the virus, often mixed in dangerous, experimental, untested combinations. The viruses are NOT dead, they are just hibernating inside a formaldehyde formula, waiting to be fed.

The polio vaccine (injected or given as nasal spray) causes new polio cases, including spreading it to the siblings of those vaccinated. The same happens after the measles and flu shots – the disease is shed and spread.

Re: Your Failure to Find Precedent for Flynn Dismissal

Regarding the decision of the Department of Justice to dismiss charges against General Flynn, in your recent call with your alumni, you expressed great concern: “there is no precedent that anybody can find for someone who has been charged with perjury just getting off scot-free. That’s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic — not just institutional norms — but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.”

Here is some help—if truth and precedent represent your true concern. Your statement is entirely false. However, it does explain the damage to the Rule of Law throughout your administration.

First, General Flynn was not charged with perjury—which requires a material false statement made under oath with intent to deceive.1 A perjury prosecution would have been appropriate and the Rule of Law applied if the Justice Department prosecuted your former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe for his multiple lies under oath in an investigation of a leak only he knew he caused.

McCabe lied under oath in fully recorded and transcribed interviews with the Inspector General for the DOJ. He was informed of the purpose of the interview, and he had had the benefit of counsel. He knew he was the leaker. McCabe even lied about lying. He lied to his own agents—which sent them on a “wild-goose-chase”—thereby making his lies “material” and an obstruction of justice. Yet, remarkably, Attorney General Barr declined to prosecute McCabe for these offenses.

Applying the Rule of Law, after declining McCabe’s perjury prosecution, required the Justice Department to dismiss the prosecution of General Flynn who was not warned, not under oath, had no counsel, and whose statements were not only not recorded, but were created as false by FBI agents who falsified the 302.

400,True,The article suggests that the Ukraine crisis is a manufactured crisis by the U.S. and England to stop Ukraine from becoming a central transit point for energy pipelines in the fast developing Eurasian Trade Zone.,True,The article mentions the U.S. government and Russia's Gazprom as powerful actors involved in the conspiracy.,True,The article suggests that the U.S. government is taking actions to stop Ukraine from becoming a central transit point for energy pipelines.,True,The article mentions the possibility of the flow of gas being cut off if the U.S. and Europe control the gas pipeline valves.,True,The article connects events and observations to support the conspiracy theory.,True,The article suggests that the U.S. government is trying to mislead the public and keep their actions covert.,"Newsletter writer Dr. Jim Willie thinks the Ukraine crisis is an enormous struggle for financial power between East and West. Dr. Willie contends, “I believe what we got with Ukraine is an absolutely desperate situation where the U.S. government realizes we have to stop Ukraine from becoming a central transit point for energy pipelines in the fast developing Eurasian Trade Zone. They need to stop the Eurasian Trade Zone because the United States and England are largely going to be excluded. If you look behind the curtain to see what is really going on, I believe this is the third attack on Russia’s Gazprom. It is a giant monopoly that Russia controls for natural gas. The first attack was veiled and it was Cyprus. Gazprom bank was gigantic and it was in Cyprus. . . . Furthermore, Russia was using Cyprus as a clearing house for buying gold bullion. . . . The second attack against Gazprom was Syria. Iran pipelines were to be connected with Syrian ports. . . . There is a war in the way. That’s what the U.S. does. There is a war in the way. Now, we have the third attack against Russia Gazprom. The U.S. and Europe actually believe if they control the gas pipeline valves, they can control the flow on the Western corner (of Ukraine) that feeds Romania, Poland and Hungary. They actually believe if they control the valves, they can control the flow. What if the flow is cut off?” Dr. Willie, who has an earned PhD in statistics, thinks the manufactured Ukraine crisis is an act of desperation by the U.S. Dr. Willie explains, “Have you ever know someone truly desperate, who has no options, that did stupid things? That’s what we are seeing now.”

Dr. Willie goes on to say, “There are so many sides closing in on the United States that it is almost becoming a tragic comedy. . . . These guys are running out of options. When I heard that Secretary of State Kerry made a threat to exclude Russia from the G-8, I said, ‘yeah right.’ That’s going to backfire, and the U.S. will be isolated. . . . I made this forecast about three years ago. I said watch the G-8 become irrelevant and the G-20 take over and China run it as opposed to the U.S. and Britain. That has now happened in the last year or 18 months. We just had a G-20 meeting in Australia, and China just railed on the United States. They said you are living off fumes. You are living off the printing press with no justifiable income. Your economy is a fake. This is getting hostile, and it was in a G-20 meeting.”

The real problem for the West will be payment for oil and natural gas in something other than dollars. Dr. Willie warns, “What’s likely to come very soon is Russia is going to demand either rubles or gold bullion for their crude oil and their natural gas. If they demand ruble payment, it immediately puts the kibosh and sabotages all Wall Street and London intervention games where they are trying to punish Russia by seeing their currency decline. We’re not in the driver’s seat being a big debtor. We’re not in the driver’s seat being a big importer of energy. We’re not in the driver’s seat on anything.”

On the value of the U.S. dollar, Dr. Willie says, “The response to U.S. pressure will be steps to kill the petro dollar and force banking systems around the world to start divesting of Treasury Bonds because they won’t need them.” When will this happen? Dr. Willie answers with a question by asking, “Do you think Putin is going to wait a long time? The time between events is really closing. . . . The whole point here could be provoking Putin and Russia into making a first strike. I don’t like using the n-word (meaning nukes), but if Russians make a large strike, then the U.S. is going to come back and make a strike 20 times larger and destroy the Russian nation. That could be what these desperate Nazi’s are trying to do.”

On gold, Dr. Willie contends, “I don’t think it would be a shock to see the Russians come out and say we’ve got over 20,000 tons of gold, and we are going to back our ruble with gold. Screw the dollar. I think in the next year or so, the Russians and Chinese are going to let it be known that between them they own close to 40,000 tons of gold. They are going to have a real currency and do a real global reset and have a real return to the gold standard and screw the dollar with all its toxic sovereign bonds. One of the principle foundations of the dollar is not gold, it’s the military. We’re seeing it now.” Dr. Willie predicts “an 80% decline in the value of the U.S. dollar in three years.”

Pfizer, which posted total revenues of $53.7 billion in 2018, announced Dr. Gottlieb’s election to the board on June 27, 2019.

Dr. Gottlieb, who led the FDA from May 11, 2017 to Apr. 5, 2019, has also been appointed to the Regulatory and Compliance Committee and the Science and Technology Committee of Pfizer’s board.

Prior to his appointment as FDA commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb served on the board of directors of pharmaceutical companies Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Daiichi Sankyo Co. He also served on the investment board of GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK), currently the fourth largest vaccine maker in the world.

Dr. Gottlieb’s Strong Opinions About Mandatory Use of Vaccines

As FDA Commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb often expressed strong opinions about the safety and mandatory use of vaccines. He has said he does not believe there is a need for further scientific research into reported vaccine side effects, such as the development of regressive autism in previously healthy children after vaccination.

He was also outspoken this year about his belief that children attending school with vaccine exemptions are to blame for measles outbreaks and the federal government should intervene if states do not restrict or eliminate vaccine exemptions.

On Feb. 14, 2019, Axios reported that, “The federal government may try to take action if states don’t tighten their vaccine exemption laws and measles continues to spread in sections of the U.S.,” according to FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. Axios quoted Dr. Gottlieb as saying, “Too many states have lax vaccine laws.”

Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) told Axios that 100 cases of measles in a population of 320 million “is not a public health emergency,” and “should not be used to justify eliminating the legal right to exercise informed consent to vaccination, which is protected by the inclusion of flexible medical, religious and conscientious-belief vaccine exemptions in public health laws.”

States could “force the hand of the federal health agencies”

On Feb. 20, Dr. Gottlieb again publicly criticized the existence of exemptions in state vaccine laws requiring U.S. schoolchildren to receive FDA licensed and CDC recommended vaccines.

“Some states are engaging in such wide exemptions that they’re creating the opportunity for outbreaks on a scale that is going to have national implications.” He said if “certain states continue down the path that they’re on, I think they’re going to force the hand of the federal health agencies,” and added that, “You could mandate certain rules about what is and isn’t permissible when it comes to allowing people to have exemptions.”

On Feb. 22, NVIC’s Loe Fisher questioned Dr. Gottlieb’s comments implying that federal agencies could intervene and override state vaccine laws.

In an interview with THV-11 (CBS) in Arkansas, she pointed out that the federal government makes vaccine use recommendations and state governments make vaccine laws. She said, “It is highly inappropriate for federal government officials, particularly the commissioner of the FDA, to threaten state legislators with federal action if they don’t tighten vaccine exemption laws,” adding that “The federal government should not be interfering in what is a states’ rights issue.”

Why Federal Intervention in State Vaccine Law is Not Legal

On Feb. 28, Northeastern Professor of Law Wendy Parmet, JD wrote an article published in STAT News reviewing legal issues with regard to the suggestion made by Dr. Gottlieb that federal health agencies could intervene in state vaccine lawmaking and restrict or eliminate vaccine exemptions. She said:
• None Close Ties and Financial Entanglements: The CDC-Guaranteed Vaccine Market by the Children’s Health Defense Team

Professor Parmet added, “Nor should Congress give such authority to any federal health agency. Although mandates can save lives, they can also stoke backlashes…by working to improve public education around vaccines, enhancing transparency, educating and paying health professionals to talk to parents about vaccines, and ensuring vaccine safety, federal officials can help bolster trust in vaccines. Those efforts, more than anything, may lead to fewer exemptions.”

On Mar. 5, Dr. Gottlieb suddenly announced that he was resigning as FDA Commissioner to spend more time with his family. Media coverage of his resignation announcement focused on his vow to crack down on companies that market vaping to minors.

This claim challenges the legitimacy of Obama's presidency and suggests a conspiracy surrounding his place of birth.,True,"Malik Obama, Barack Obama's half-brother, is explicitly named in the article as the person who tweeted the image of the alleged birth certificate.",True,"The action in this article is the tweet made by Malik Obama, claiming to have a birth certificate for Barack Obama.",False,There is no mention of any threat in the article.,True,"The article discusses the ongoing tensions between Donald Trump and Barack Obama, including Trump's previous challenge to Obama's legitimacy as president based on his birth certificate.",False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"Barack Obama’s estranged half-brother Malik has tweeted an image of what he claims is a birth certificate for the former president. The authenticity of the document is questionable, with the results not too surprising given Malik’s political allegiances.

“Surely. What’s this?” Malik tweeted Thursday with the image of the alleged document containing details of Obama’s parents and the date and time of Barack’s birth. Also included is the alleged origin of the document, revealing Obama’s much-disputed place of birth as Mombasa, Kenya.

Obama’s legitimacy as president was questioned during both his terms, most famously by current Commander-in-Chief Donald Trump, who challenged him to produce his birth certificate over doubts he was born in the US. It wasn’t until during Trump’s run for presidency last year that he finally backed out of the dispute, saying Obama was in fact born in the US.

Tensions between Trump and Obama have continued, most recently with the president claiming his predecessor ordered the tapping of Trump Tower during his election campaign, an allegation Obama has denied.

The document tweeted by Malik Obama has not been verified and is unlikely to prove Trump’s previous claims. Obama’s half-brother was a long-time Democrat but switched his support to the Republicans during Trump’s election campaign, even attending an election debate as his guest.

According to Malik, the last time he saw Obama was in 2015. “I went to the White House to say hello. I paid a courtesy call,” he said. “As usual, it was a hands-off kind of thing, very businesslike, very formal.”"
403,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions several actors, such as the Bush-Cheney administration, Iraqi Judge Radhi al-Radhi, Nouri al-Maliki, U.S. contractors like Halliburton and Blackwater, and government officials.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by various actors, such as corruption, embezzlement, fraud, and assassination.",False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to highlight the level of corruption in Iraq and the actions of the actors involved.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Iraq is now the third most corrupt country in the world

The Bush-Cheney administration has something else for which it can congratulate itself, in addition to the military quagmire it created in Iraq with its ""surge."" According to the international corruption watchdog group Transparency International, Iraq is now the third most corrupt nation in the world, ranking just ahead of last place Somalia and the military dictatorship of Burma.

It is so bad in Iraq that Iraqi Judge Radhi al-Radhi, who was in charge of anti-corruption efforts in the country as head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity, was forced to flee Iraq for the United States last year. Thirty-one of al-Radhi’s investigators were assassinated, a clear indication that it was time for al-Radhi and his family to escape. It is clear that the government of U.S. puppet Nouri al-Maliki, who, along with his top henchman, have squirreled away billions in bank accounts and real estate holdings in Switzerland, London, and Chicago. The Maliki assassins were so brutal that even the bodies of 12 family members of al-Radhi’s investigators were found with drill holes in their bodies, evidence that they were tortured before they were murdered.

Saddam Hussein’s government never approached the level of corruption in Iraq now being advanced and nurtured by the puppet Maliki regime. In bed with U.S. contractors like Halliburton, Blackwater, and other firms that have raked in obscene profits from the neocon-inspired and directed war, the Maliki regime has turned over Iraq’s oil production to foreign oil companies, failed to properly account for its own oil revenues, ignored even the most basic accounting procedures, and now plans to play a diversion game by suing businessmen and government officials in the West it accuses of profiting from the Saddam Hussein era’s United Nations ""Oil-for-Food"" program.

Meanwhile, the State Department, which contracted with al-Radhi to oversee anti-corruption efforts in Iraq, now wants nothing to do with him. Almost broke and living in a suburb of Washington, DC, al-Radhi has been the subject of a neocon character assassination campaign. Even though al-Radhi has testified before Rep. Henry Waxman’s House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the Democrats did nothing as al-Radhi’s son reportedly had his U.S. residency visa pulled by the State Department and was forced to return to Iraq where he now faces a fate similar to al-Radhi’s investigators and their families if Judge al-Radhi does not cease his criticism of Maliki and his corrupt cronies.

Maliki has ensured that he and his cronies are exempt from anti-corruption investigations and Iraq’s former Electricity Minister Aiham Alsammarae, appointed by US viceroy Paul Bremer and already convicted for fraud, escaped from Baghdad’s Green Zone in late 2006, with the assistance of Blackwater, during his trial for embezzling billions of more dollars from Iraq’s coffers. Alsammarae now lives very comfortably in Oak Brook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Alsammarae is a friend of convicted Chicago land developer Tony Rezko. An INTERPOL Red Notice arrest warrant remains active on Alsammarae, although it has mysteriously disappeared from INTERPOL’s web site.

Maliki issued an order that he, his current and former ministers like Alsammarae, and President Jalal Talabani, who is overseeing his own profits for him and his own cronies in the area governed by the Kurdistan Regional Government, are exempt from any anti-corruption investigations.

Alsammarae’s colleague, former Iraqi Defense Minister Hazen Shalaan, also fled Baghdad after being convicted for fraud, including buying used Polish weapons and claiming they were new. Shalaan, also the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice arrest warrant, lives comfortably in Acton in west London, according to a BBC investigation. The BBC reported that Shalaan jets around the world in a private jet regardless of the INTERPOL warrant. The BBC estimates that Shalaan, Alsammarae, Maliki, and the other fraudsters who govern Iraq have siphoned off some $23 billion. Only about 5 to 6 percent of Iraqi funds get to the intended recipients, the rest is ending up in the pockets of Maliki and his cronies, as well as in the coffers of US companies, the most prominent and corrupt being Vice President Dick Cheney’s former firm, Halliburton.

The Republicans on Waxman’s committee, particularly outgoing Rep. Tom Davis (R-VA), attempted to discredit al-Radhi. The GOP members pointed out that al-Radhi’s charges were ridiculous since General David Petraeus had already testified before Congress that the situation in Iraq was going so well. WMR has previously reported that Petraeus has also personally benefited from fraudulent activities during his tenure in Iraq; activities that were discovered by the late Colonel Ted Westhusing, who was said to have shot himself to death in Baghdad shortly before he was to return to the United States.

To cover its own tracks of corruption, the State Department is now reclassifying documents it prepared on fraud involving the Iraqi government to Confidential and Secret from Sensitive but Unclassified. The documents all supported al-Radhi’s fraud findings against the Maliki regime. A ""gag order"" by the Bush administration is preventing any State Department or other government officials from testifying to Congress about fraud in Iraq.

Al Radhi’s and his family’s requests for political asylum are being refused by the Bush-Cheney administration. The Maliki regime has banned Al-Radhi from returning to Iraq, turning the former Iraqi judge and his family into ""stateless"" people. Moreover, the State Department, which once hailed al-Radhi’s performance, is refusing to write him letters of recommendation for employment in the private sector. Private charities are now seeing to the welfare of al-Radhi and his family.

The big game changer in the geopolitical global landscape is war coming from the Middle East. Celente explains, “It’s the war against Iran. That’s the way we see it, and we recently did a trend alert on it. The Iran war will be World War III. It will also probably be the war to end all wars and a good part of civilization if it happens. These are the Persians, and they are not going anywhere.”

Celente contends oil will be at the center of the conflict and points out, “Three years ago almost to the date, June of 2014 a barrel of oil was selling for $115, today around $45 a barrel. There is going to be economic turmoil throughout the Middle East. I always say when all else fails, they take you to war. You see the war between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, it’s going to blow into Saudi Arabia. . . . So, when we are looking at the Middle East, it’s really Iran. They are shooting down Iranian planes and shooting down Iranian drones. Iran is the bottom line in this. . . . So, we see these tensions really building up, and it’s going to be Iran. If Iran and anybody goes to war, the Russians and the Chinese take the Iranian side, and Europe and the United States take the other side.”

In the coming financial calamity trend, look no further than financially strapped Illinois that is so broke it is no longer allowed to sell Powerball lottery tickets. Illinois is insolvent and cannot pay its bills. It has hundreds of billions of dollars in bond debt and pension obligations and no way to pay them. Celente says, “All it will do is screw the people. That’s all it will do. This is like austerity measures in other countries. That means they are going to rob you of your pensions, your benefits, raise your taxes, and they will increase your retirement age until after you die. So, what they will do is keep the Ponzi scheme going. . . . There are two different worlds. The people’s lives can continue to decline. That we are seeing with the wage data. Obama bragged, folks I created 10 million jobs. According to the Harvard/Princeton study, 94% are temporary work. So, you can see all these collapses going on, but they will keep the Ponzi scheme going. So, we will have a decline, in absence of a wild card, and we see a 10% correction in the market. If we have terror strikes or other wild cards, it’s going to be a crash because it’s all being held up by lies and dirty deals for the very rich.”

Celente thinks the economy is so weak that it must be propped up by massive fraud, and that means any black swan can sink this economic scam overnight. Celente contends, “It’s over, it’s over and that’s why gold is the ultimate safe haven to me.”

What specifically is Celente watching to tip him off trouble is coming? Celente says we are watching Iran and any confrontation with Iran . . . and we are watching tech stocks and the possibility of a sell-off and also the price of oil. . . . There is too much supply and not enough demand–end of story.”

The Swedish government has issued a 20-page pamphlet to 4.8 million households in Sweden urging them to prepare for World War 3.

Despite Sweden not being at war for over 200 years, the government have abruptly warned all of its citizens to get prepped, and fast.

Just before Christmas last year, the Swedish government discreetly published a paper called “Resilience.”

The paper required citizens to be prepared for 3 days without help, which seems like a baby step into war preparation.

ZeroHedge reports The booklet, titled, If Crisis or War Comes, is an updated version of one distributed in the 1980s.

It was compiled by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and references several potential crises that could occur, according to the Swedish media:

incidents occurring in the rest of the world

The brochure warns Swedes of things that every prepper knows. “In the event of a societal emergency, help will be provided first to those who need it most.

The majority must be prepared to cope on their own for some time.” Here’s what Swedish website The Local has to say about the warnings.

“Water, food and warmth” as well as an ability to obtain information from authorities are the most important things in such a scenario.

The guide provides a checklist of foodstuffs and goods it’s useful to have at home just in case, ranging from basic vegetables to long-lasting oat or soy milk, tinned protein like sardines or boiled meat, and items for providing warmth, access to communications, and for storing water.

The booklet also has a checklist to help Swedes be better prepared to cope with misleading information and influence operations, noting that “the best protection against false information and hostile propaganda is to critically appraise the source” by asking questions like “is this factual information or opinion?” and “who has put this out?”.

“Sweden is safer than many other countries but threats exist.”

Supply checklists are included, with suggestions for stocking up on things like mineral water, wet wipes, and tinned hummus.

There are directions to bomb shelters, as well as instructions for what to do if ATMs, cellphones or the internet stop working.

Sweden urged citizens to be prepared to defend their country.

The preparedness brochure also reminds citizens of the possibility of conscription (the draft) for anyone between the ages of 16 and 70, because everyone has “duty to contribute to the total defense.”

The mention of propaganda is repeated in this section.

“If Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up. All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false.” (source)

But speaking of propaganda, there’s no mention of the unchecked immigration that has turned parts of major cities into war zones. Is it possible that the war of which they’re warning could be a civil one?

An influx of asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa has strained the welfare system and the criminal justice system.

The crime in Malmo and Stockholm has skyrocketed. You can read about it in these articles:

Violence against women has also increased dramatically.

According to the Swedish Crime Survey, compared to 2015, attempted rape against girls 15 – 17 was up 46 percent in 2016.

Rape of teens in that same date and age range is up 19 percent.

Attempted rape of girls under 15 increased 16 percent; rape of young girls in that same age increased by 26 percent.

…The politically correct laws of Sweden mean that the perpetrators cannot be described to the public, including their ethnicity.

The women of Sweden have had to change how they live or risk attack…

The fact that much of the crime is committed by migrants in a no-go zone is swept under the rug, which is pointed out in this article in Sputnik News (a Russian government-controlled news agency).

In the article quoted above, there are videos and quotes from police officers who are breaking their silence about the migrant crime wave.

Could it be that the real enemies are already within Sweden? Whether their worry is the Russians, the refugees, or some other threat, one thing is certain.

Sweden is getting ready for battle and we all need to pay attention."

What are the negative side effects of 5G technology?

It’s something that’s all around us constantly, blasting past and through our bodies completely unseen, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. But just what are the long-term health effects of ionizing radiation, especially in advanced technologies like 5G that are slated to be much more intense than anything ever before seen?

First of all, there’s simply no denying that ionizing radiation is not good for people, seeing as how the vast majority of published, peer-reviewed research has already proven it to be hazardous to human health. But what about 5G specifically?

On average, people who own mobile phones touch them more than 2,600 times per day – and on the upper end of the spectrum, as much as 5,400 times per day. Seeing as how these devices already emit ionizing radiation via 3G and 4G, that’s a whole lot of ionizing radiation entering your body through your hands and head.

But 5G is a whole different animal, emitting ionizing radiation in focused blasts, and way high up on the gigahertz (GHz) spectrum – which, simply put, means your body will receive unprecedented doses of ionizing radiation all day, every day.

According to Peter Paul Parker, a contributor at Waking Times, the 60 GHz broadcasting spectrum on which 5G is set to operate will affect the human body in a whole different way from previous “G” iterations, specifically with regard to the way that it’s expected to interact with the body’s oxygen molecules.

“You do not mess with oxygen molecules,” Parker writes, noting that 5G will operate within the spectrum range that most affects oxygen molecules negatively.

“What happens at the molecular level when you have oxygen molecules being bombarded with radio frequency emissions at 60 gigahertz? It affects the orbital properties of the electrons, and the haemoglobin’s ability to bind to the oxygen molecules. This is absolutely horrific and psychotic,” he explains, noting that the human body can’t survive longer than about three minutes without oxygen.

Scientist warns that 5G is the same technology as HAARP, which is believed to produce “chemtrails”

Parker further contends that, based on the testimony of at least one scientist, 5G is basically the same technology used by HAARP, the shorthand name for the government’s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.

HAARP, as we’ve previously reported, is believed to be the technology behind “chemtrails” and other geoengineering programs involving weather manipulation. HAARP is also associated with mass mind control, as researched at length by Dr. Nick Begich.

“HAARP will zap the upper atmosphere with a focused and steerable electromagnetic beam,” Dr. Begich stated in a past episode of the Natural News Talk Hour with host Jonathan Landsman.

“It is an advanced model of an ‘ionospheric heater.’ The ionosphere is the electrically-charged sphere surrounding Earth’s upper atmosphere. It ranges between 40 to 60 miles above the surface of the Earth.”

In much the same way, 5G will apparently “heat” the insides of people’s bodies, directing ionizing radiation at cells and turning them into tiny antennas capable of re-transmitting RF signals – making the human body a living, breathing 5G transmitting “tower.”

“This technology is already being used not only by the Military Industrial Complex, but by the American Police,” warns Parker. “It is used to disperse crowds.”

“When this technology is directed at a human body, you feel like your skin is on fire. Do you really want this kind of technology on every lamp post in your living area? If this is not ringing alarm bells with you already, then unfortunately you are one of the sleeping masses.”"

It mentions the covert actions of the White Helmets and the intentions of the actors to mislead the public.","The official trailer for the latest Call of Duty was released a few days ago, and it features the Syria narrative management operation known as the White Helmets depicted in heroic roles. Characters wearing the organization’s signature headgear are seen clearing rubble in part of the trailer for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

To give you an idea how popular the CoD franchise is, as of this writing the official Youtube version of the trailer has 27 million views.

To be clear, the characters in the game are most certainly intended to resemble the White Helmets of Syria, and their presence there is most certainly intended to increase support for and interest in that group. How do I know? Its game writer has explicitly said so.

“Kurosaki says he wants ‘Call of Duty’ to be spoken of as on par with the best war films, and he hopes ‘Modern Warfare’ will inspire fans to check out the harrowing and eye-opening documentaries ‘The White Helmets’ or ‘Last Man in Aleppo,” the LA Times reports.

The White Helmets are what legendary journalist John Pilger describes as “a complete propaganda construct“, an operation designed by former British army officer and private military contractor James Le Mesurier to manipulate the narrative about what’s going on in Syria. This excellent half-hour mini-documentary by James Corbett clearly outlines the way the operation is used to create footage implicating the Assad government in the slaughter of civilians via chemical weapons attacks and other camera-friendly war crimes, the mountain of evidence of their ties to literal terrorist organizations in Syria, and the western funding and media manipulations that have been pouring into elevating the outfit.

It’s a brilliant invention, really. Have a purportedly neutral group filming on the ground in “rebel”-held areas (where the White Helmets exclusively operate), and you can ensure an endless supply of footage which can be used to paint a longtime western target for regime change as a barbarian who needs to be ousted. And indeed, the extremist jihadist factions which overran Syria with the backingof the US and its allies nearly succeeded in toppling Assad prior to Russia’s intervention, and we may be certain that the agenda to control who rules over the geostrategically crucial region remains as intact as ever.

The pro-White Helmets propaganda is not Call of Duty‘s first foray into US military narrative management. As noted by journalist Max Blumenthal in April, an earlier CoD game depicted the assassination of the leader of Venezuela and, bizarrely, attacking Venezuela’s hydroelectric dam and energy grid with the goal of causing power outages like the ones the nation has been struggling with. Citing public information, Blumenthal documents how such games have been “developed with substantial input from America’s military intelligence apparatus”, as well as the CoD designer’s involvement with the Pentagon and the NATO narrative management firm the Atlantic Council.

People playing these games, mostly impressionable young men, are manipulated into desiring to accomplish the goals that are laid out for them in order to win, all of which involve killing and many of which happen to align with preexisting US military agendas. They are desensitized to mass military violence, trained to support and identify with US military campaigns, and taught that being a member of the military might just be a fun and noble way to spend one’s future.

Propaganda in video games doesn’t get the kind of pushback you see against propaganda in news media and movies, largely because the content in the games is generally only viewed individually by those who are engrossed in playing them. It’s this whole closed-off world that is manipulating minds with very little scrutiny compared to other forms of media, which is troubling, because the video game industry is so vast that for many years its earnings have eclipsed those of the movie and music industries combined.

This needs more attention. The sane, healthy response to learning that one’s government and its allies were arming and training terrorist groups in Syria would have been screaming, earth-shaking rage for months, accompanied by a demand for an unequivocal apology, immediate repair of all damage done, and war crimes tribunals for everyone who was involved. Instead, the news passed by with barely a whisper, and now when you see Syria mentioned it’s generally to condemn its president for fighting back against that unforgivably depraved act of regime change interventionism. This has been happening because people have been propagandized. Nothing will change until we find a way to help human minds unplug from the narrative control matrix and awaken to what’s really going on.

For weeks, he wrote the virus off as a liberal “hoax” designed to force him out of the White House. Rather than providing leadership at the top, his main concern appears to be shifting American anger towards China, insisting on calling the pandemic the “China virus” and demanding Beijing be held to account for their supposed mishandling of the coronavirus. He also appears to be actively blocking New York State’s attempts to procure thousands of lifesaving ventilators. “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be,” he told Sean Hannity on Thursday, adding that, in the midst of a seemingly exponential rise in cases, that he wants to “start opening up certain parts of the country” again, because the cure can’t be worse than the disease.

Unlike in other countries, testing for the virus remains extremely limited. Germany, a country with a far smaller population, has been testing 500,000 people per week. The US has still not reached that number in total. As Danny Haiphong wrote: “A deep thirst for profit among powerful elites dictates all social policies and organizations in the United States and this thirst has deadly consequences.” Trump’s subsequent pronouncement that the churches should be full on Easter Sunday was perfect proof of this, and will doubtless lead to an untold number of deaths.

Trump’s air ball on the most important test of his presidency should lead to a slam dunk opportunity for the Democratic Party come November. And fortunately, they have a perfect candidate for the crisis: Bernie Sanders. An unprecedented public health crisis requires a public healthcare solution. Sanders has been championing and popularizing Medicare for All. His proposals are popular: some polls show that 70 percent of the public, including a majority of Republicans, support it. Not only that, but 91 percent of peer-reviewed studies of a Sanders-like healthcare plan alsoconclude that it would actually save the United States money, 86 percent showing it would immediately begin paying off in year one. Bernie remains the country’s most popular senator and has a massive and dedicated army of activists willing to work for him.

But instead, the Democratic Party appears intent on selecting former vice-president Joe Biden as their candidate, immediately coalescing around him before Super Tuesday. Biden is the consummate party insider, dogged by corruption scandals and a long history of terrible voting and policy proposals. He recently suggested that he would automatically veto any Medicare for All proposal as president, even one that had already been passed by the House and the Senate. Worse still, he has now been credibly accused of raping a former staffer, Tara Reade.

Holed up in his own house, and making an unending series cringe-worthy gaffes that show his cognitive decline every time his handlers allow him to interact with media or the public, the former Delaware senator increasingly looks like yesterday’s man, as Branko Marcetic has written.

In contrast, Sanders is showing real leadership. The 78-year-old is not self-isolating, but fighting for workers’ and unemployment rights to be included in bailouts, leading virtual town halls online, informing the public of what is going on.

Nevertheless, Biden is looking like an increasingly certain bet to lose to Trump in November, if he even makes it that long as the nominee. Already, Andrew Cuomo is being floated by many in the establishment as a possible substitute. However, for many in the Democratic elite, they believe have already won the real election. If Sanders is vanquished, a member of the corporate elite will become president in November, whether it will be the human corporation in Trump or the “Senator for MBNA” in Biden.

If we are not going to choose sacrificing the population to serve the market, as many Republicans are now demanding, COVID–19 means implementing huge wealth redistribution measures to keep the country going and starting comprehensive, socialist-style policies that will give the public ideas about how society should be run in the future. Sanders is the obvious choice for anyone committed to beating Trump. But the Democrats are intent on blowing the layup to ensure that the wealth of the country stays in the hands of the superrich.

It also suggests that there may be secrecy surrounding the Saudi government's ties to terrorist elements and the inhibiting of investigations by the FBI, CIA, and White House.","The US House Intelligence Committee has published a redacted version of the declassified missing 28 pages taken from the Congressional Joint Inquiry into the 9/11 Commission report.

The pages, released Friday, were speculated to contain references mentioning Saudi involvement in the 9/11 terror attacks, after 15 of the alleged 19 hijackers were revealed to be from Saudi Arabia.

“While in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government,” the report reads. “There is information, primarily from FBI sources, that at least two of those individuals were alleged by some to be Saudi intelligence officers.”

The report goes on: “The Joint Inquiry’s review confirmed that the Intelligence Community also has information, much of which has yet to be independently verified, indicating that individuals associated with the Saudi Government in the United States may have other ties to al-Qa-ida and other terrorist groups. The FBI and CIA have informed the Joint Inquiry that, since the September 11 attacks, they are treating the Saudi issue seriously, but both still have only a limited understanding of the Saudi Government’s ties to terrorist elements.”

Joint inquiry officials also commented that the CIA and FBI’s failure to “address the Saudi issue” was “unacceptable.”

Previously, several law enforcement agents including the FBI and police came forward with statements that investigations were inhibited when it came to looking at Saudi Arabia’s role.

“The FBI was thwarted from interviewing the Saudis we wanted to interview by the White House,” said former FBI agent and investigator Mark Rossini, who added the White House “let them off the hook.”

Former Fairfax County Police Lt. Roger Kelly also said the FBI would not field questions on Saudi Arabia.

“The FBI covered their ears every time we mentioned the Saudis,” Kelly told the New York Post. “It was too political to touch.”

The newly-released pages comprise a fraction of the joint inquiry’s 838-page report into the attacks, but were ordered classified by the Bush administration in 2004.

Numerous high level Obama administration officials, including the president himself, have argued the release of the pages could pose a significant hazard to national security.

In May, CIA Director John Brennan told NBC the release of the missing pages could reveal “sensitive methods” used by US intelligence,” in addition to the government’s “investigative actions.”

Obama had previously commented on legislation passed by the Senate which would allow the families affected by the 9/11 attacks to sue the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia over their alleged involvement.

“This is a matter of how generally the United States approaches our interactions with other countries. If we open up the possibility that individuals and the United States can routinely start suing other governments, then we are also opening up the United States to being continually sued by individuals in other countries,” Obama told CBS News’ Charlie Rose.

Questions still remain given White House adviser Richard Clarke’s admitted involvement in removing Saudi officials from the country following the 9/11 attacks.

“The adviser, Richard Clarke, who ran the White House crisis team after the attacks but has since left the Bush administration, said he agreed to the extraordinary plan because the Federal Bureau of Investigation assured him that the departing Saudis were not linked to terrorism,” the New York Times reported in 2003.

A national health emergency has been declared by Mexico’s federal government amid the accelerated spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as the number of cases surpass 1,090.

Mexico’s top health officials and various presidential cabinet members declared a national health emergency during a streamed news conference to allow better coordination between federal agencies in response to the crisis.

Undersecretary of Health Hugo Lopez Gatell said the confirmed cases jumped from 993 to 1,094 on Monday.

As on Tuesday, there are now 28 deaths and another 2,752 undergoing tests.

Lopez Gatell added they were requesting a complete shutdown of non-essential businesses and for the public to stay home.

“We have been given an opportunity to slow this down,” he said, claiming the virus would peak in weeks if there were no action.

But if the public stays indoors, the virus would reach a lower peak in June with fewer fatalities.

Mexico’s Foreign Secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said businesses that do not comply with the shutdown could face fines or forced closures.

“It would be suicide for a business to not follow the recommendations,” Ebrard said.

Earlier this month, Mexico called for its northern border with the United States to be closed off to stop the spread of the virus.

Mexican Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said at the time:

""Mexico wouldn't bring the virus to the United States; rather, the United States would bring it here.""

""The possible flow of coronavirus would come from the north to the south.""

""If it were technically necessary, we would consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance,"" he said.

""To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus.""

""If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!""

Earlier this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said a lockdown across America to halt the spread of the coronavirus could last 10-12 weeks, or until early June.

The gifts included Russian folk art handmade crafts and personal greetings.

The supplies were handed over to the Russian Defense Ministry as part of the all-Russian humanitarian initiative“Children of Russia – to Children of Syria,” TASS reports, citing the Russian military. The initiative, proposed by the children themselves, saw thousands of pupils from over 10 Russian regions taking part.

It also included the students of Russian military schools such as the renowned Suvorov Military School and the Nakhimov Naval Academy as well as ordinary pupils in Russian public schools.

Each individual package dispatched to Syria included a handmade item, which could be a postcard, a drawing, a clay figure or even a piece of self-penned poetry, besides other presents, the Russian Defense Ministry reported Tuesday.

Every pupil who took part in the initiative also sent a handwritten postcard with best wishes for the New Year to children in war-ravaged Syria.

Some of the presents have already been distributed among Syrian children.

“This will raise their morale, and the holiday will acquire a positive note,” said Asif Assad, director of the Hashim Yusuf school, one of the first to receive the gifts from Russia, as cited by TASS. Assad also expressed his gratitude to Russia for providing basic supplies to the country’s population.

The Russian Center for Reconciliation in Syria is engaged in a months-long humanitarian mission in Syria and in particular the recently liberated city of Aleppo.

On Monday, another two tons of humanitarian aid were handed over to residents who left eastern Aleppo and have been living in a temporary accommodation facility in the Benezid area of the city. Hot meals and other necessities are also being provided by Russian officers.

Earlier this week a unit of the Russian military police arrived in Aleppo to help distribute humanitarian aid and protect Russian sappers demining areas cleared of militants in eastern Aleppo.

Meanwhile, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, terrorists and militant groups carried out 28 bombardments of Aleppo province and other areas, including Damascus, on Sunday and Monday."
414,True,"The article suggests that Facebook engages in bias against conservative news sources and manipulates news in various ways, indicating a potential conspiracy.",True,The article mentions Facebook as the actor responsible for engaging in bias and manipulating news.,True,"The article describes the actions taken by Facebook to promote establishment sources, boost visibility of certain issues, and block certain articles.",False,There is no explicit mention of threats in the article.,True,The article connects various events and actions by Facebook to suggest a pattern of bias and manipulation.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"Facebook trending news engages in bias against so-called “conservative” news sources such as the Drudge Report, Breitbart, Newsmax, the Washington Examiner and Infowars in favor of establishment sources, including The New York Times, CNN and the BBC, according to former contractors.

“It was absolutely bias,” a former curator told Gizmodo. “Every once in awhile a Red State or conservative news source would have a story. But we would have to go and find the same story from a more neutral outlet that wasn’t as biased.”

In other words, the curators “subjectively” preferred establishment bias on stories about Rand Paul, CPAC, Mitt Romney and other topics considered conservative.

Moreover, curators would use an “injection tool” to promote stories that were not trending to boost visibility of particular issues and topics not “attaining critical mass on Facebook quickly enough.” Examples include the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris and the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.

Stories about Black Lives Matters were also artificially boosted on the popular social media network.

“Facebook got a lot of pressure about not having a trending topic for Black Lives Matter,” a curator said. “They realized it was a problem, and they boosted it in the ordering. They gave it preference over other topics. When we injected it, everyone started saying, ‘Yeah, now I’m seeing it as number one.’”

Last week we reported on an effort by the social media giant to blacklist a trending topic if it didn’t have at least three establishment news sources covering it. Curators were instructed to “select articles from a list of preferred media outlets that included sites like the New York Times, Time, Variety, and other traditional outlets,” according to Gizmodo’s Michael Nunez.

Facebook manipulates news in other ways as well. On Saturday, Infowars reported fans of the Alex Jones Facebook page not being uable to see a live Facebook Mentions video regarding the rise of Donald Trump. According to reports, normal notifications for the live video did not appear to alert page subscribers.

Facebook removed an article on GMO labeling in July. When users attempted to share the article, according to an Infowars report by Adan Salazar and Anthony Gucciardi, they were presented with a notification: “This message contains content that has been blocked by our security systems.”

The website also blocked an Infowars story about the rape of a Swedish woman by illegal immigrants last December. Facebook described the story as “xenophobic.”

The ban came after a meeting between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. During the meeting, an open microphone caught Zuckerberg promising the German leader he would block anti-immigrant stories.

In September, it was reported German Minister of Justice Heiko Maas met with Facebook to form a special task force that will work to remove comments from the website that “call for hatred” against migrants. The organization will be overseen by Network Against Nazis, a group led by left-wing activist Anetta Kahane, Paul Joseph Watson reported. Kahane worked as a Stasi informant under the codename “Victoria” from 1974-1982. The Stasi, which liaised with the Soviet KGB, was the official secret police of the former Communist government of East Germany.

News manipulation at Facebook should not come as a surprise. Facebook’s second round of funding came from venture capital firm Accel Partners. Its manager James Breyer was formerly chairman of the National Venture Capital Association and served on the board with Gilman Louie, CEO of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm established by the CIA in 1999. One of the company’s key areas of expertise is in “data mining technologies,” writes Matt Greenop.

During the Church Committee hearings in the 1970s, it was discovered the CIA had manipulated the media since the early 1950s.

“The CIA currently maintains a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times attempt to influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda. These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals, scores of press services and news agencies, radio and television stations, commercial book publishers, and other foreign media outlets,” a report produced by the commission explained in 1976.

Additionally, also beginning in the 1950s, the CIA worked with the Ford Foundation to undermine anti-establishment influence in media and produce cultural propaganda.

Holter says, “We’re probably in recession again . . . the economy has been quite weak. It looks to me we could be breaking down in the stock market. This is going to be a really critical week.”

On the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, Holter contends, “From a credibility standpoint, the Fed has to raise rates. In a real world, I don’t think they can raise rates. If they raise rates, my guess within two weeks you will see all the markets close. A rate rise, even a quarter of a point in Fed Funds, would smoke derivatives. You would see a chain reaction, and we would probably see a chain reaction even before they raise rates.”

Holter contends the banking system is interconnected and very weak and explains his point by saying, “Look at what happened when the Swiss dropped their peg to the euro. That basically has tanked the Austrian banking system. The Austrian banking system is on the verge of collapse because they lent in Swiss Francs. The strength in the Swiss Franc makes those loans much more difficult to pay back. That’s thrown the entire (Austrian) banking system out of kilter. If you do that with the dollar and you raise rates, and the dollar gets strong or spikes up 5% or 10% overnight, what’s that going to do to banks all over the world? That’s going to create a smoking black hole of derivatives.”

On the possibility banks bailing themselves out with depositor money, or so-called bank bail-ins, Holter predicts, “I think it’s highly likely. Once this goes, it’s going to go really quickly. I’ve said this before, this will go completely around the world within 48 hours. Would they bail-in the banks within 48 hours? Probably not, but our banks would not be open, and we would probably have a banking holiday. That means your credit card, ATM or nothing works.”

Holter says his top picks that will cause the system to crash this year are Greece, Ukraine and Austria. Holter explains, “Ukraine has a dire financial situation and talking about a big payment due in June that they can’t pay. They don’t have the money. We also heard news that 50 Abrams tanks were sent from the U.S. on the way to Ukraine. That’s terrible news. That, on its own, can start a war. . . . If that war went hot and a nuke was lit up, within 48 hours the entire system would be shut down.” Holter goes on to say the third big top in what he calls a three ring circus is Austria. Holter says, “It’s basically the Austrian system over a very small payment, a $600 million payment is throwing them off kilter. It’s come about because of the loans made in Swiss Francs. The Swiss Franc was revalued (30%) higher. So, now you have a whole bunch of loans in Austria where the loan is valued higher than the property itself. . . . That’s thrown the Austrian banking system into bankruptcy, and Austria is one of the strong European countries.”

In closing, Holter says, “In my opinion, our financial system is so far gone, and our leaders know it is so far gone and it’s going to collapse, that they almost have to have a war to blame the collapse of the markets on. . . . We are trying to start a fight anywhere that we can. Doesn’t matter where it is. We need to have a war, let it escalate and let the markets collapse, and blame the collapse of the markets, which will happen whether we have a war of not. They are trying to hold the markets long enough until they can get a war started.”

Few people outside of the U.S. intelligence community and congressional intelligence committees are aware of a post-World War II intel-sharing agreement between the United States and four other nations.

Known as “Five Eyes,” intelligence services from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia are bound by what is formally known as the UKUSA Agreement outlining joint cooperation in the gathering, processing and sharing of signals, military, and human intelligence (SIGINT, MILINT and HUMINT).

In recent years, reports based on leaked secret documents indicate that, in order to get around each country’s strict rule against domestic spying, the various intelligence services from each of the five countries spy on citizens of all the other countries. In November 2013, The Guardian reported:

The phone, internet and email records of U.K. citizens not suspected of any wrongdoing have been analysed and stored by America’s National Security Agency under a secret deal that was approved by British intelligence officials, according to documents from the whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The following month, The Guardian reported that the Australian government’s spy agency had also offered to share information it had actually collected on its own citizens with the other Five Eyes members. In January 2014 the paper reported that the NSA had offered information on British citizens to the U.K.’s spy agency, and in June 2013 Reuters noted that Britain’s spy agency – the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the equivalent of the CIA, was tapping international communications cables, then sharing captured data with the NSA. (RELATED: McCain Challenges Trump To Prove Obama Wiretapped Him… Even Though There’s Clear Evidence He Did.)

In short, the relationship between Five Eyes intelligence agencies has been incestuous, to say the least, with each agency tapping the communications of each others’ citizens and then sharing it with that country’s intel services.

With that being said, did President Obama utilize the unique Five Eyes agreement to bypass U.S. intelligence agencies to illicitly gather information on then-GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump’s campaign? Judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News seems to think so.

As reported by Breitbart News, Napolitano, in a Tuesday appearance on the network’s morning show, “Fox & Friends,” said three sources have told Fox News that Obama sought the GCHQ’s assistance in transcribing intercepted conversations involving Trump, so there wouldn’t be a ‘paper trail’ leading back to him.

“[T]hree intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didn’t use the NSA. He didn’t use the CIA. He didn’t use the FBI, and he didn’t use Department of Justice. He used GCHQ. What the heck is GCHQ? That’s the initials for the British spying agency. They have 24/7 access to the NSA database. So by simply having two people go to them saying, ‘President Obama needs transcripts of conversations involving candidate Trump, conversations involving president-elect Trump,’ he’s able to get it, and there’s no American fingerprints on this,” Napolitano said.

If true, it wouldn’t be the first time the Five Eyes agreement was used for self-serving and egregious purposes, quite obviously. (RELATED: Memo to McCain: Of course Trump Tower was under surveillance; what did Obama know and when did he know it should be your question.)

Allies share intelligence and that’s the way it ought to be; it’s a dangerous world, and no one intelligence agency can possibly monitor everything all at once. And besides, sometimes its helpful to get another country’s perspective on a certain topic or target.

But was this the purpose of the 71-year-old agreement? It’s hard to say; even after seven decades, there isn’t much known about its secret provisions. Privacy International says this is the extent of what is known about the agreement:

Under the agreement interception, collection, acquisition, analysis, and decryption is conducted by each of the State parties in their respective parts of the globe, and all intelligence information is shared by default. The agreement is wide in scope and establishes jointly-run operations centres where operatives from multiple intelligence agencies of the Five Eyes States work alongside each other.

Further, tasks are divided between SIGINT agencies, ensuring that the Five Eyes alliance is far more than a set of principles of collaboration. The level of cooperation under the agreement is so complete that the national product is often indistinguishable.

So it’s entirely plausible the Obama White House tapped into this network to obtain information on a rival presidential campaign in a way that was not directly traceable back to the Oval Office.

San Francisco Liberals now have a new patron saint, and it’s none other than climate change bully Greta Thunberg. Painted in the style of the iconic Socialist Workers posters from the 1920’s and ’30’s, Greta Thunberg casts her chilly, disapproving gaze down from towering heights on the mere mortals below, using her eyes to carry out her shrill commands. You can almost picture this painting adorning the walls in the prisons where Liberals would send those who oppose them to if they had the power to do so. If Liberals win in 2020, they just might.

If John F. Kennedy was to somehow set foot in Washington tomorrow, he would look at his former Democratic Party and have no idea what he was seeing, such is the drastic degree to which it has changed over the past 50 years. No longer the party of protecting the rights of the individual, the 2020 Democratic Party has become the party of Socialist ideals, enforced at the point of a gun. Today, Greta Thunberg stares down on the San Francisco skyline, God help us if the day ever comes when she’s staring down from Washington.

FROM BREITBART: Greta Thunberg gained international attention over the past year after launching the Fridays for Future movement, where school children skip classes to protest adults who aren’t doing enough to combat so-called man-made climate change.

The mural was painted by Andres “Cobre” Petreselli, and the local CBS affiliate compared the painting of the 16-year-old Swede to Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.

“The mural is still a work in progress, as Cobre is spending his days hoisted high up on a platform about 10 stories above Mason street, on the side of the Native Sons building near Union Square,” CBS reported.

“What I want from people is to realize have to do something for the world,” Cobre said. “Otherwise, it’s going to be the beginning of our extinction.”

CBS reported on the “political” nature of the mural: Cobre says his paintings often provoke strong reactions. He painted the Robin Williams mural on Market Street that has recently been demolished to make way for some high rise apartments. But this work of art , he said, is different.

“This one is more political, because I want them to think about it,” Cobre said. “What’s the message behind it? Maybe to create conversation with friends: ‘Have you seen the mural of Greta? What is it about? Climate change.’”

The painting was commissioned and paid for by the environmental group One Atmosphere, but the artist donated his time for the project, according to CBS.

“You hit people with public art and it hits them in the heart,” Paul Scott, executive director of One Atmosphere said in the CBS report. Scott said he hoped the mural would inspire people to “act.”

“When people pass by, I’m sure they will be struck by the image and I hope that will help open their hearts and their minds to the remarkable conviction in Greta’s words,” Scott said. “Her voice is about truth and sacrifice in a time where lies and selfishness seem to be the rule. Hopefully where she leads, others will follow.”

Scott said he’s hoping that the ceremony planned to celebrate the mural’s completion “would go a long way toward paying the rest of the expenses of the mural, as well as other public art projects.” READ MORE

Burry as the main actor who shorted the mortgage bond market and created a Twitter account to address the government response to the pandemic.,True,The article mentions Michael J. Burry's actions of shorting the mortgage bond market and creating a Twitter account to address the government response to the pandemic.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article discusses Michael J. Burry's views and opinions on the government response to the pandemic.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"The movie The Big Short was inspired by the true story of Michael J. Burry, the weird and slightly autistic hedge fund manager who shorted the mortgage bond market in 2007 (his role was played by Christian Bale). Indeed, after processing thousands of pages of data in his powerful, computer-like brain, Burry predicted the mortgage crash months before it actually happened. He also made tons of money off the situation by betting against the housing market – a move that was never seen before. The net result: He made $100 million for himself and $700 million for his investors.

Since then, Burry focused on private investing (mostly water, which he considers to be the commodity of the future) and remained steadily away from the spotlight. However, the massive panic and lockdown caused by COVID-19 seem to have triggered an error message in his powerful, computer-like brain. And that error message was so persistent that it compelled him to do the unthinkable: He created a Twitter account. His goal: To address the sweeping, unprecedented government response to this pandemic.

Burry is not saying that people should immediately go back to sketchy bars and lick each other’s faces. He’s calling for a measured approach, one that allows healthy people to live normally and go to work while protecting those who are at risk. In short, he believes that the current remedy might be worse than the disease. In an interview with BNN Bloomberg, Burry stated:

“I became active on Twitter in the last week for the first time ever. I just had a lot to say and get off my chest. I joined Twitter because I was deeply saddened by a national shut-in that is devastating the livelihoods of Americans in many ways. I saw the prevailing narratives ignoring the masses that are not at lethal risk from COVID-19. Stay-at-home policies need not be universal. COVID-19 is a disease that is somewhat lethal for the obese, the very old, the already-sick. Public policies have no nuance because they want to maximize fear to enforce compliance. But universal stay-at-home policies devastate small and medium-sized businesses and indirectly beat up women and children, kill and create drug addicts, engender suicides, and in general create tremendous misery and mental anguish. These secondary and tertiary effects are getting no play in the prevailing narratives. Stay-at-home policies are only good for equipment and medicine shortages at or near peak disease. But this could be achieved with the order affecting a much more targeted group of people. Meanwhile, stay-at-home reduces and slows the development of herd immunity to COVID. Herd immunity is a fundamental step to putting this behind us. I am very private, but what is going on in this country and globally supersedes that. In the end, Twitter is a risk-free activity. I have only been on Twitter for a week or so, but I figure l will just try to focus and not to get too deep in the weeds.”

In many ways, Michael Burry is the anti-Bill Gates. While Gates recently called for a mind-boggling 10-week national lockdown (and for microchipping those who get the upcoming vaccine), Burry calls for a quick end to the lockdown and the introduction of a more targeted approach. Although both Burry and Gates are very rich, there’s a major difference between them: Burry is an actual licensed physician with an M.D. from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine while Bill Gates is a college dropout with zero qualification in medicine. However, it is Bill Gates who the “authoritative figure” right now.

Since joining Twitter on March 23rd, Burry has been posting several times a day with a laser-like focus on COVID-19 response. While, at first, his tweets garnered little attention, things began to pick up when people realized who he was. Here are some of his tweets in chronological order.

In the following tweet, Burry addresses an article written by no other than Henry Kissinger titled The Coronavirus Pandemic Will Forever Alter the World Order.

Here, Burry takes aim at his COVID-19 arch-nemesis, Bill Gates.

Burry is not done with his twitterstorm. He actually added a few tweets while I was writing this article.

In the current climate of fear and media-generated panic, Michael Burry brings his brand of fact-based analytical thinking. While most media pundits (i.e. Bill Gates) are backed by powerful organizations with hidden agendas, Burry is basically a private person who appears to be genuinely concerned with the well-being of his fellow citizens. As Burry says, now is the time for facts, not fear.

Although one might not agree with his views, his voice needs to be heard. We need to have a rational debate about the correct response to this situation. Because if governments keep putting billions of people on house arrest every time there’s a new virus, we’re in serious trouble.

2020 hopeful Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris said that the United States requires a president who knows how to prosecute President Donald Trump, according to reports. 



Harris, whose father recently lashed out at her over claims about smoking pot and her Jamaican heritage, cited her former job as state attorney general before going for the President while speaking to supporters in Bettendorf, Iowa.

The 2020 presidential candidate said, “we’re gonna need a fighter, and we’re going to need somebody who knows how to prosecute the case against this president.”

Harris pitched herself as the perfect candidate to beat Trump in 2020 to the audience of around 500.

According to a report from The Hill she also pounced on Trump's recent Tweet regarding 4th Of July celebrations

""I think the President needs to realize it’s America’s birthday, not his birthday,” she said Sunday while at a campaign event in Iowa.

The Democrat was the attorney general of California from 2011 to 2017 before being elected to the Senate, but even that didn't come without some controversy.

Last month, Harris was caught boasting about prosecuting parents including a homeless mom whose kids missed classes in a video from 2010.

In the video, Harris who at the time was attorney general for California, smugly described how being 'tough on truancy' got results when she was the district attorney for San Francisco.

In January, Harris launched her 2020 presidential bid promising to 'lead with integrity' and 'speak the truth' in a speech was used to indirectly c President Donald Trump.

Harris criticized Trump's border wall as 'a medieval vanity project' before slamming the administration's immigration policy.

'When we have children in cages, crying for their mothers and fathers, don't you dare call that border security, that's human rights abuse,' Harris said.

Although didn't Trump by name, it was obvious who she was referring to."

Just last week, a billion dollars of gold (paper contracts) was reportedly dumped on the market in about a minute. The price went down less than $10 per ounce and, shortly afterwards, bounced back up. Morgan explains, “They are running out of ammunition as far as I can tell, which means when they do these massive sell-offs, they are being less and less effective. They have to use more and more power to get less and less result. This is why I am saying they are running out of ammunition. They have to do a fair amount of work to get the price down, and then it bounces right back. It shows you the resilience in the gold market. They can’t push it down, but they are not going to let it rise either because of this pricing mechanism to say dollar good, gold bad.”

Morgan says the silver price in the $14 per ounce range and gold around $1,200 per ounce is about mining cost for both metals. Morgan says, “This tells me you can’t get it much lower for very long. . . . Central banks are buying gold not because it is in the monetary system, but because of fear–fear of what is going to happen to the U.S. dollar. That is a fundamental fact. Where are we technically? I’d say we are near a bottom right now (in both metals). Gold is now making a higher low, and silver is also making a higher low. . . . I think by the end of the year that we will be certain that this is the low.”

There is another very big reason to own physical gold and silver, and that is the possibility the Deep State and the Globalists will crash the financial markets. This is not a farfetched concept as President Trump has declared a “national emergency” to “protect the financial system” in a December 2017 Executive Order. Morgan thinks, “If you look at the potential reaction by the Deep State, these people do not lose gracefully. . . . These people will stop at absolutely nothing. So, you have to factor that into your thinking, which means they could certainly take down the financial system because they are losing the game. In other words, turn over the card table, that’s what the metal is for. . . . You’ve got to outthink these people. You’ve got to be two or three moves ahead. So, if they are going to turn over the table, you have to be prepared before they turn over the table and what to do after they turn over the table. So, we are in a ‘state of emergency’. . . . Listen, we need a reset. We need a new monetary system, and we need money working different than it’s working now. If we have a reset and the bankers stay on top again, regardless of how they do it, we’ve really gained nothing.”

These events can be seen as threats to peace.",False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"President Barack Obama drew some harsh criticism from the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, after his comment last week to return to the 1967 borders. Like it or not, the President is trying to jump start peace talks between Israel and Palestine. Yesterday, the President tried to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Israel during a speech he gave to AIPAC (American Israeli Public Affairs Committee). I listened to the entire speech, and I have to admit, it was one of President Obama’s best since he’s been in office. When it came to the 1967 Israeli borders, he said this, “And since my position has been misrepresented several times, let me reaffirm what “1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps” means. By definition, it means that the parties themselves -– Israelis and Palestinians -– will negotiate a border that is different than the one that existed on June 4, 1967. . . . The ultimate goal is two states for two people: Israel as a Jewish state and the homeland for the Jewish people — and the State of Palestine as the homeland for the Palestinian people — each state in joined self-determination, mutual recognition, and peace.” (Click here for the complete text of the speech.)

The Palestinians are hoping the United Nations will grant them independence in September of 2011. (Click here to read more on this story.) It is a self-imposed deadline and, peace deal or no peace deal, the Palestinian Authority (PA) will ask the U.N. to recognize the state of Palestine. One insurmountable problem is the recent unification of the two Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah (PA). Hamas is considered a terrorist organization that seeks the destruction of Israel. That is one very big sticking point and, I think, a deal breaker right out of the box. Retired Major General Yitzhak Gershon said yesterday on FOX News that this combination “. . . will continue the conflict forever.”

Meanwhile, UPI is reporting more protests are being planned by Palestinian groups. The story yesterday reported, “A Palestinian group Sunday said more protests were being planned along Israel’s borders and warned it is “just the beginning.” . . . The committee called for peaceful marches next month “to the borders of historic Palestine,” the news agency said.” (Click here to read the entire UPI story.) A little more than a week ago, on the Israeli, Syrian and Lebanon border, protests were anything but “peaceful.” A Daily Mail story said, “Israeli troops today clashed with Arab protesters along three hostile borders, including the frontier with Syria, leaving 16 people dead and dozens more wounded in an unprecedented wave of demonstrations marking a Palestinian day of mourning for their defeat at Israel’s hands in 1948.” (Click here for the complete Daily Mail story.)

On the Israeli side, there are certain territories that will not be given up because of their strategic importance. The Golan Heights on Israel’s Northeast border were part of Syria before the “Six-Day War” in 1967. This mountainous region has peaks that are 3,000 to 4,000 feet high and were used to fire down upon Israel. It is hard to believe that Israel would give this up even with the recently deployed “Iron Dome” rocket defense system that is successfully knocking out enemy projectiles. (Click here to read more about the Iron Dome.)

Then, there are protests by right-wing Israelis that are totally against trading any land for peace. Yesterday, the Jerusalem Post reported, “Right-wing activists demonstrate holding banner “Israel can’t be divided” referring to proposal for negotiations based on 1967 lines.” (Click here for more from the Jerusalem Post.)

Wouldn’t it be nice if everyone could hold hands and work out a lasting peace deal? What is happening is just the opposite– the two sides are moving farther apart instead of closer together. I applaud the President for trying to get a peace deal, but you cannot have peace if both sides are not even talking. Israel has the most sophisticated and the best armed military in the entire Middle East. (And yes it has nuclear weapons, too.) If a war breaks out involving Israel, it would be the wild card of wild cards. There would be no way to predict an exact outcome, but it would surely be a disaster for the entire world."

Iraqis under a curfew in Baghdad spilled out into the streets in celebration of the verdict, news footage showed. But protests were held in Saddam Hussein's hometown.

Along with Hussein, his half-brother and former intelligence chief Barzan Hassan, and former chief judge of the Revolutionary Court Awad Bandar also got death. (Watch Hussein shout protests during sentencing -- 4:05 )

Taha Yassin Ramadan, a former vice president of Iraq, was sentenced to life in prison.

""The verdict was predetermined and has nothing to do with court proceedings,"" Ramadan said.

Mohammed Azzawi Ali, a former Dujail Baath Party official, was acquitted because of insufficient evidence against him, the court said.

The three others -- Abdullah Kadhem Ruwaid, Ali Dayem Ali, and Misher Abdullah Ruwaid -- were sentenced to 15 years each.

There will be automatic appeals for the four who were sentenced to death and life in prison.

The 50-minute session was dramatic. Hussein entered with a Quran in hand, as he had in the past. He began screaming Allahu Akhbar -- God is great -- as the verdict and sentencing was read.

He also argued with the chief judge and shouted, ""Damn you and your court.""

As the judge ordered him taken away, Hussein said, ""Don't push me, boy.""

Bandar also screamed Allahu Akhbar as he was taken out of court.

Defense attorney Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general, was ousted by judges early in the session. The court asked him to leave, saying he had come here from the United States to mock the Iraqi people and the court.

Another defense attorney, Ziad al-Najdawi, angrily told reporters as he left the courtroom, ""That's the American justice.""

The Dujail case stemmed from a crackdown against townspeople after a 1982 assassination attempt against Hussein in the town. The crackdown involved the ordered executions of 148 males.

Before Sunday's verdicts were announced, a curfew was imposed in Baghdad and two provinces -- Diyala and Salaheddin -- with large Sunni populations ahead of expected violence.

Predominantly Shiite and Kurdish provinces were not under curfew.

About 2,000 protesters in Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit on Sunday defied the curfew and demonstrated in support of the former leader.

A witness said the protesters carried posters of the former president and were shooting into the air.

The numbers of demonstrators grew after the sentence was announced. A complete movement ban -- both people and vehicles -- was imposed on Sunday in the provinces of Baghdad, Diyala and Salaheddin -- where Tikrit is located.

The Baghdad International Airport also shut down until further notice.

This verdicts come nearly three years after U.S.-led forces plucked Hussein out of hiding and just a few days before U.S. midterm elections, with the Iraqi war at center stage.

The U.S. ambassador in Iraq praised the verdicts and sentencing as ""an important milestone for Iraq.""

""Although the Iraqis may face difficult days in the coming weeks, closing the book on Saddam and his regime is an opportunity to unite and build a better future,"" Zalmay Khalilzad said in a statement issued shortly after the verdicts were rendered. 



Outbursts and walkouts

 

 The Dujail trial, the first in what is a series of proceedings against former regime officials, began October 19, 2005, and ended July 27. It was a turbulent courtroom battle witnessed on TV across the globe.

It was marked by outbursts and harangues from Hussein and his co-defendants, lawyer walkouts, much-criticized court actions, and complaints from lawyers about poor security. There were grave concerns about security for legal teams and their families; three defense lawyers were killed. (Full story)

Witness testimony and prosecutors got their case across, however. According to court documents, the military, political and security apparatus in Iraq and Dujail killed, arrested, detained and tortured men, women and children in the town. Homes were demolished and orchards were razed.

The Revolutionary Court sentenced 148 males to death, with Saddam's signature ratifying the order.

But there were other deaths as well -- nine people were killed during the destruction of orchards, and many of the 399 people who had been detained were either killed or remain missing.

Hussein, Hassan and Ramadan were charged with willful killing, deportation or forcible transfer of population; imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental norms of law; torture; enforced disappearance of persons, and other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering; or serious injury to the body or to the mental or physical health.

Bandar was charged with willful killing by issuing the death sentences for the 148 people.

The remaining defendants were lower-level Baath Party officials from Dujail, who were charged with informing on residents who later died in prison or were sentenced to death.

Hussein is also in the middle of another trial involving the 1988 Anfal campaign, the government offensive in the country's Kurdish region. Hussein is charged in that case with genocide.

Historically, whenever you have illegal activities, there is cover up. And where there is a cover up, there is invariably the mad rush to quickly destroy the evidence so it cannot come back to bite you later. Some excellent examples of evidence destruction by screamingly guilty people in questionable events are as follows:
• Debris from Twin Towers after 9/11: Before much examination of the evidence of the destruction of that day could take place, the ruins of the World Trade Center towers was unceremoniously dumped on barges and shipped off to, of all places, China. Some 185,101 tons of structural steel have been hauled away from Ground Zero. Most of the steel has been recycled as per the city’s decision to swiftly send the wreckage to salvage yards in New Jersey. The city’s hasty move has outraged many victims’ families who believe the steel should have been examined more thoroughly. Last month, fire experts told Congress that about 80% of the steel was scrapped without being examined because investigators did not have the authority to preserve the wreckage. source
• Sandy Hook School Demolished: The Town of Newtown, Conn., spent almost $1.4 million on the abatement and demolition of the former Sandy Hook Elementary School. Construction crews recently finished demolition, which cost $850,000, according to a press release issued Thursday by the town. Additionally, abatement cost $1.3 million. The process of building a new elementary school in the town will likely begin this year in the late summer or early fall months. Residents voted last October to raze the structure and reconstruct a new academic building on a modified version of the former site. Nothing will stand where a gunman killed 26 individuals in December 2012. source
• Tom Brady Destroyed Cell Phones In Deflategate Scandal: “Finally, any reasonable litigant would understand that the destruction of evidence, revealed just days before the start of arbitration proceedings, would be an important issue,” it reads. “It is well established that the law permits a trier of fact to infer that a party who deliberately destroys relevant evidence the party had an obligation to produce did so in order to conceal damaging information from the adjudicator.” Basically, the court is OK with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell using the destroyed cell phone as further support for his determination that Brady failed to cooperate with the investigation. source

And all this brings us to the ongoing soap opera that is the Hillary Clinton Illegal Email Server Show

The more this drags on, the more it becomes obvious that not only did Hillary Clinton conspire to break the rules as Secretary of State, many high-ranking individuals in the Department of Justice have conspired and are currently conspiring to prevent all the evidence of Hillary’s illegal activities from coming to light.

In a letter from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday, Goodlatte questioned why the destruction of the laptops used to sort Clinton’s emails was included in immunity deals that already protected Mills and Samuelson from prosecution based on the records recovered from their computers.

Jason Chaffetz “If Hillary Clinton’s Emails Were A Mistake Why Is Everyone Pleading The 5th”

“Like many things about this case, these new materials raise more questions than answers,” Goodlatte wrote of the “side agreements,” which lawmakers were allowed to read even though they have not yet been released in full to members of Congress.

The House Oversight Committee exposed publicly the immunity agreements provided to Mills and Samuelson last month. Critics quickly questioned why the two Clinton aides were permitted to accompany Clinton to her early July interview with the FBI if they had already become immunized witnesses in the case. The FBI said that because it was a voluntary interview, investigators had no control over who Clinton brought with her.

In his letter, Goodlatte noted that the immunity agreements revealed the FBI agents limited their search to documents authored before Jan. 2015. The Republican chairman argued such parameters prevented investigators from examining potential proof of the destruction of evidence that may have occurred after that date, and that the deals offered to Mills and Samuelson already protected the aides from prosecution related to their alleged roles in the deletion of federal records.

An attorney representing both Mills and Samuelson negotiated immunity deals for the Clinton aides before agreeing to hand over their laptops."

Remember this Iranian man licking the Islamic shrine in Qom, Iran — a country that is a hotbed of the Wuhan virus, claiming he wanted to catch, and spread, COVID-19?

Here in the United States, people are encouraged by a new social media fad called the “coronavirus challenge” to lick toilet seats and other public surfaces in order to spread the virus.

As examples, on March 14, 2020, Ava Louise, a 21-year-old white woman who fancies herself a social media “influencer,” posted a video of herself licking the toilet seat on a plane, with the the caption “Please RT this so people can know how to properly be sanitary on the airplane.”

On March 19, this video was posted on Twitter showing a young black man licking a pole on a subway train while a white dude who was sitting nearby wearing a mask moves away.

On March 22, another video was posted on Twitter of a young white man licking items on a shelf in Walmart and saying, “Who’s afraid of coronavirus?”.

The man was later identified as 26-year-old Cody Pfister of Warrenton, Missiouri, who was arrested on terror charges. Court documents say Pfister “knowingly caused a false belief or fear that a condition involving danger to life existed” and accuse him of acting with “reckless disregard of the risk causing the evacuation, quarantine or closure of any portion”.

Mexico has announced plans to reopen the economy by June 1, so that must mean the COVID-19 pandemic is largely under control there, right?

That appears to be what leaders like President Andres Manual Lopez Obrador want people to believe. The economy there has taken a serious hit, like many places, and the reopening is said to be “cautious and gradual.”

And on the surface, the death toll of 4,200 and 40,000 infections looks a lot better than the situation in the U.S.

Unfortunately, those numbers may be little more than smoke and mirrors as inside sources and an investigative report by Sky News has found that the federal government there is significantly underreporting the country’s public health crisis.

According to a Sky News investigation, the country is actually cremating bodies on an “industrial scale.”

The news team gained access to crematoriums and morgues in Mexico City and learned there’s a three-day backlog in cremation throughout the city’s public crematoriums, with some workers saying more burials will be needed because their burning capacity is exhausted.

They reported that “the bodies don’t stop coming” and staff are working around the clock to try to keep up with the backlog.

Calculations carried out by Sky News indicate that the total number of cremations each day in the urban area of Mexico City total 600; the average number of people dying in the two federal entities covered by the urban area is officially reported at just 374.

This means there were 226 excess deaths, at a minimum, taking place each day in early May that weren’t being reported, and there’s no question that most of them are related to the deadly virus; crematorium sources told Sky that 80 to 90 percent of the deaths they deal with daily are from COVID-19.

Some have even implied that the coffins housing COVID-19 victims are being reused. Temporary morgues in hospitals there are not refrigerated, and families who don’t trust the government are asking funeral home directors to open coffins and confirm that it is their relative who is being cremated.

In fact, Sky witnessed one such interaction in which a funeral director ripped open plastic sheeting to expose a corpse’s face for a family member; no one involved wore a mask, gloves or goggles.

Real numbers could be at least 5x the reported figures

According to Sky’s analysis, the official figures being given by the government are just 19 percent of the actual number there. This might sound pretty familiar to anyone who has followed how figures were reported in Wuhan, China.

Meanwhile, VOX has reported that Mexican doctors, mayors, former government officials, and funerals home directors have said the situation there is horrific, with some estimating that the actual death numbers could be as much as eight times greater than official figures suggest.

National Autonomous University of Mexico molecular genetics lab chief Dr. Laurie Ann Ximenez-Fyvie said: “If Mexico is good at anything, it’s hiding numbers.”

The extent of the outbreak there probably isn’t helped by the fact that some businesses and open-air markets are operating normally there, and social distancing isn’t really part of the vocabulary.

Some people familiar with the situation have theorized that the government wants to just “tough out the virus spread” and then deal with all of the fallout later on. As for the inaccurate death rates, some feel it could be an attempt to keep people in poorer areas from panicking.

Of course, the out-of-control coronavirus outbreak in Mexico could also have big ramifications on the U.S. as people continue to cross the border illegally and potentially bring new infections along with them. Americans should be paying very close attention to how the coronavirus crisis plays out in Mexico and take steps to ensure it isn’t spread across the border."

We reported to you back in April on something called a ‘Beyoncé Mass‘ that was held out in California at the Grace Episcopal Cathedral. Simply put, the ‘Beyoncé Mass‘ was about 90 minutes of the music of Beyonce, sprinkled with a random sampling of bible verses, and ‘preaching’ about the various social justice issues of the day. How do you top that? Easy, have a service featuring people in giant tree costumes and ‘preaching’ about Climate Change. No, not kidding.

“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;” 1 Timothy 4:1 (KJV)

The Episcopal Church, commonly referred to as ‘Catholic Lite‘, was never what you might call a real Christian church, certainly not from a Bible believer’s perspective anyway. But even for them, this is a stunning departure from doctrine that could even be remotely considered as Biblical. When your church service becomes a combination of a Saturday Night Live sketch and a Chick tract, you know that time is just about up.

“He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.” Revelation 22:20 (KJV)

FROM THE CHRISTIAN POST: Grace Episcopal Cathedral of San Francisco held an interfaith worship service last week that was part of the multi-day Global Climate Action Summit. In addition to different religious groups participating in the service, a group of people portraying tall Ent-like creatures were part of the ceremony, including the closing processional.

The seat of the bishop for the Episcopal Diocese of California, Grace Episcopal Cathedral lists the issue of “climate change” as one of its social justice outreach efforts.

“Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. It already adversely affects many lives, especially among the world’s poorest people and nations,” the church says online. “It is a spiritual and religious issue as much as a political and social one; the earth is loved by God, created by God, in-dwelt by God and we are called to care for it.”

The service garnered criticism from across the Atlantic in a column published Sunday by The Telegraph.

Tim Stanley, leader writer at the Telegraph and editor for the Catholic Herald, cited Grace Cathedral’s service as evidence that Western Christianity is “committing suicide.” “They have transformed a faith that only extended as far as it did through preaching and martyrdom into something anxious and introspective, excessively concerned with gender pronouns and saving the redwood tree,” wrote Stanley.

The fire broke out later on Thursday night, according to local news reports.

Fire investigators say they discovered lighter fluid and a box of matches at the scene, leading them to believe the blaze was a deliberate arson attack.

The restaurant was open at the time the fire broke out and some of the patrons believe the blaze was started deliberately.

“All of a sudden we see these flames. A fire has been started—a very big fire,” Nicole Lafragola, a witness, told WJLA.

Another patron who was dining in the pizzeria at the time, a male who did not identify himself, said that a curtain at the back of the restaurant suddenly burst into flames.

He said he helped to pull down the curtain while the staff put out the fire with extinguishers.

“I smelled what smelled like a lot of lighter fluid,” the man said.

“My suspicion is it’s arson, I don’t have the evidence on that.”

Lafragola says she saw a man acting oddly before the fire broke out.

The way he left the restaurant also made her suspicious.

“He seemed like he was there with a purpose obviously, and he didn’t stick around,” Lafragola said.

""This gentleman doesn’t acknowledge that he sees this fire, he just walks right out and doesn’t make eye contact with anyone.""

According to the Epoch Times, the restaurant gained nationwide fame after Edgar Welch, 28, broke into the establishment with a gun in December 2016 acting on a conspiracy theory triggered by the release of thousands of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

The theory, since named “Pizzagate,” alleged that Comet Ping Pong and nearby restaurants engaged in child-sex trafficking and other grave crimes involving high-level government officials.

Podesta’s emails, released by Wikileaks in October 2016, contained communications with James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, about a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton.

The emails also contained many strange references to food, among them a reference to a handkerchief described as having a “map that seems pizza related.”

Since “cheese pizza” is slang for child pornography, online sleuths suspected that the strange food references could be code language for child abuse.

The suspicions were inflamed with voluminous circumstantial evidence, including a Comet employee posting images fusing images of pizza and sexual intercourse.

Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis spoke before the gunman's sentencing.

Alefantis called “Pizzagate” a “vicious web of lies” and said many people had suffered because of Welch’s actions.

According to the New York Post, a police report confirms that several spent matches and a bottle of lighter fluid were found near the burned curtain that hung in the backroom of Comet Ping Pong after the alleged arson on Wednesday.

The curtain was destroyed in the fire, which was put out by staff members at the Northwest Washington restaurant, the report said.

An image of the suspect — who is still at large — was captured on surveillance video, investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms said.

He’s described as a man between the age of 25 and 30, with blonde hair, a mustache, and a beard."

On Easter Sunday, Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, didn’t celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ the Messiah. Instead, he preached about universal basic income (UBI), encouraging governments of the world to widely adopt it for the “betterment” of humanity.

In a letter he wrote to members of various social activist groups, Francis stressed that a big part of his mission in this world is to advance a hybrid form of communist socialism that will ensure a steady stream of fiat currency to those who have “no steady income.”

“I know that you have been excluded from the benefits of globalization,” Francis wrote. “You do not enjoy the superficial pleasures that anesthetize so many consciences, yet you always suffer from the harm they produce. The ills that afflict everyone hit you twice as hard.”

Francis specifically named “street vendors, recyclers, carnies, small farmers, construction workers, dressmakers,” and “different kinds of caregivers” as the types of people he believes deserve a UBI. Giving these people free money would “acknowledge and dignify the noble, essential tasks you carry out,” he further wrote.

“It would ensure and concretely achieve the ideal, at once so human and so Christian, of no worker without rights,” Francis ultimately declared.

Because of rapid technological advances in production and other tasks that are making actual human labor obsolete, many are being left behind, is Francis’ take on the situation. Thus, the time is ripe to implement a new world order where people are taken care of by their benevolent governments, apparently.

“I hope that this time of danger will free us from operating on automatic pilot, shake our sleepy consciences and allow a humanist and ecological conversion that puts an end to the idolatry of money and places human life and dignity at the center,” Francis contends.

“Our civilization – so competitive, so individualistic, with its frenetic rhythms of production and consumption, its extravagant luxuries, its disproportionate profits for just a few – needs to downshift, take stock, and renew itself.”

Pope Francis is the communist false prophet of the new world order

You’ve got to admit that Pope Francis has a way with words. He knows how to inject just the right amount of Christian-sounding verbiage into his lofty diatribes about social justice and doing away with free-market capitalism, which is something he’s been pushing for many years now.

Keep in mind that Francis incorporated these same things into his actual Easter message, which complemented this letter he wrote to social justice warriors everywhere who believe that the duty of the state is to take care of them by providing free money for survival.

By all appearances, Francis is the false prophet spoken about in the book of Revelation who’s leading his followers astray and herding them straight into the new world order. His promises of a Utopian future built upon free money from the government is the same message coming from the likes of two-time failed presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who also opposes free markets.

At some point, all of this is going to converge into a new world religion, which will require worship of the beast, a part of which will be mandatory acceptance of microchip vaccinations and total herd tracking. Such chips will also be necessary in order to buy and sell, or to receive the UBI paychecks that Francis is demanding.

Beware of anything that sounds too good to be true because it probably is. And in this case, it will come with plenty of strings attached, including the requirement that a person sell his soul in exchange for everything being promised in the name of fairness, equality, decency and goodness.

The grisly results of this high-tech research and development project have been hidden from public view for over seven decades!

In 1943, World War II was raging fiercely on land and sea. The United States Navy set up special projects to develop new technologies to help defeat the Nazis. One area of special interest was how to hide ships from radar or visual detection.

Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a Serbian genius and rival of Thomas Edison. Both were inventors, engineers, and futurists who envisioned a world full of technological advantages. After working briefly for Edison, Tesla left after his boss refused to pay an enormous sum of money Edison had (jokingly) offered Tesla for an invention – which Tesla produced.

Tesla is most famous for discovering and patenting the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating current (AC) machinery. However, he worked on a wide variety of projects, including the “Tesla coil,” which is still used in radio technology. His dream project, never realized, was to provide worldwide communication – for free.

Less known is Tesla’s work in light refraction and electromagnetism. He believed that it was possible to bend light around an object that emitted an intensely strong electromagnetic field, thus making the object invisible to direct observation as well as radar.

President Franklin Roosevelt chatted with Tesla about the feasibility of this promising military idea. Convinced that Tesla could deliver the goods, the Commander-in-Chief committed U.S. Navy funding to develop the ability for U.S. ships to sneak across the Atlantic Ocean without being detected by German U-Boats.

Tesla became project director and produced calculations and drawings to build high-power generators to install below the deck of a test ship. These huge generators would create an enormously powerful force field around the ship to “cloak” it and make it invisible.

As reported by Al Bielek, who, along with his brother Duncan, joined the Institute of Advanced Study project in 1940 as an engineer, the Navy had conducted several failed tests before succeeding that same year: a small Navy tender disappeared from sight and camera in September 1940 from the Brooklyn Navy shipyard.

Immediately, the project became classified and named “Rainbow.” Its goal now was to develop cloaking technology for seacraft as large as a battleship. Roosevelt had a test ship moved to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Navy shipyard. That ship was the U.S. Navy destroyer escort “Eldridge.”

President Roosevelt said, “If you can make that ship disappear, you can make any ship disappear.”

Tesla’s theories were not being taught in universities. The mathematical physics used was advanced for its day, involving multiple realities, time fields, quantum physics, and Einstein’s unified field theory (which was still classified at the time).

The Bielek brothers official job was to report on a monthly basis to the Navy on the Rainbow Project’s research, development – and budget. The two Ph.D. physicists later learned they were also in training to become the non-Naval officers in charge of running the equipment during the planned test. Al Bielek said:

“They [the Navy] didn’t want a bunch of sailors running it and they didn’t want an ordinary officer running it who didn’t understand the theory because not only were you entrusted with this equipment and the ship, if it became a fully successful operation, you also had to know because, with the theory that was involved, that you ran the equipment rather carefully and followed certain guidelines. Otherwise, you could find yourself dropping out of time altogether…” [emphasis added]

What if there were a monumental environmental threat that you didn’t even know was happening? What if you found out it is affecting your health and that of people you know and love? What if you knew it was such an enormous problem that it has the potential to destroy our crops and trees, the soil they are grown in, our entire water supply, and whole ecosystems – and that if you didn’t act, we could never turn back?

We are not talking about fracking, nuclear energy, or the oil industry. We’re not even talking about climate change.

What if it came into use in an insidious way, just as GMO foods have come into our food supply without our knowledge? What if it appeared to be harmless, but it wasn’t? And what if it were so cleverly woven into our culture that we didn’t even see it anymore? What if it were so masterfully stigmatized and wrapped in controversy that if you thought it strange or concerning, you’d be scorned or ignored?

It sounds like science fiction, but it’s not. It’s happening right above you, and it’s called “geoengineering”.

You can find articles and debates in which scientists are proposing to “dim” the sun to slow down climate change, using a technique called “Solar Radiation Management” (SRM). Their concept is to mimic the dimming and cooling effects of a volcanic eruption and existing particulate pollution made by human activity. However, it has been out of the proposal stage for decades, and even though officials will not acknowledge it, SRM has long since been fully deployed.

SRM sounds like a viable solution to slowing climate change, and scientists have repeated how “cheap” it is over and over again. But it comes with a price. In fact, it comes with many.

Global climate engineering/geoengineering programs are radically disrupting weather patterns, disrupting the hydrological cycle (causing drought in some regions, contributing to wildfires, and fueling flooding others), destroying the ozone layer, and contaminating the entire planet with the toxic fallout from these atmospheric spraying operations.

Again, climate engineering programs have been fully deployed for decades . There is a mountain of hard science data and film footage to back up this statement of fact. All available data indicates that the ongoing global geoengineering programs are mathematically the greatest single assault against the web of life ever launched by the human race. To interfere with Earth's life support systems can only be described as insanity. Unfortunately, this is exactly what the completely out of control military industrial complex has done. There are no regulations on these atmospheric spraying programs, there is no oversight whatsoever. We, all of us, are all being subjected to the ongoing illegal atmospheric testing.

What I’d like to bring to the forefront is the fact that Ebola has been found in the Bible Code!! If you are unfamiliar with the Bible Code—aka: Torah Code. It is a code found in the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. This code can be found by skipping equal numbers of letters through the original Hebrew text. This phenomenon is called ELS—Equidistant Letter Sequencing. Simply put they are finding messages in the Torah by skipping the same amount of spaces, and finding words in an acrostic puzzle like manner. A computer program has been designed to look for key words hidden in code. As a result the code has verified many things including: the death of Saddam Hussein, the rise of Hitler, man landing on the moon, JFK’s death, election of Obama, wars, and more.

In the video below Rabbi Glazerson, who is a renown Jewish Rabbi and studied at Medrashiat Noam in Pardes Chana and authored more than 30 books in Hebrew, now teaches directly from the Gematria, or Bible Code. While he is not a Christian I do find what he states fascinating. That in mind please bear with his “broken English” considering he is a Jewish Rabbi and English is not his native language.

Violently taken away= Disappearing Ebola patients both on the border and in hospitals.

Say Drink= Ebola causes fever and thirst

The Cave= Likely references the animals Ebola originates from

Aireborne= Could mean the spread of Ebola through aerosols or eventually full blown airborne

Every Man Child= Referencing that death is not limited to a certain age but anyone can catch it

Millions= I believe this could reference that millions are affected by it–be it through fear of the disease or deaths in the future. But my gut says it’s more likely the fear of the disease that millions are affected by.

What is strange is that this is exactly what we are witnessing. So at this point I think the Bible Code is pretty spot on but hopefully the prediction of millions is not the death of millions but the fear of millions….I guess time will tell!! But in the meantime I wanted to bring you the latest!"

REMEMBER TO BREATHE.

 “As the Father loves me,

 so I also love you.

 Remain in my love.

 If you keep my commandments,

 you will remain in my love….

 This is my commandment:

 love one another as I love you.

 No one has greater love than this,

 to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.

 You are my friends if you do what I command you.”

“This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.”

So what exactly is love?

In our corrupt times, the word “love” is used to justify any or all deeds, even the most perverse and evil.

Carnal lust is called “love” and given the veneer of respectability by calling it marriage. Pedophilia is called “man-boy love”. Bestiality is re-named “zoophilia” — love of animals. Incest is given the gloss by faux science as “genetic sexual attraction”.

“Love” has become a synonym of “Do as you will”.

This is what love really means.

Brothers and sisters:

 Strive eagerly for the greatest spiritual gifts.

 But I shall show you a still more excellent way.

If I speak in human and angelic tongues,

 but do not have love,

 I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.

 And if I have the gift of prophecy,

 and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge;

 if I have all faith so as to move mountains,

 but do not have love, I am nothing.

 If I give away everything I own,

 and if I hand my body over so that I may boast,

 but do not have love, I gain nothing.

Love is patient, love is kind.

 It is not jealous, it is not pompous,

 It is not inflated, it is not rude,

 it does not seek its own interests,

 it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury,

 it does not rejoice over wrongdoing

 but rejoices with the truth.

 It bears all things, believes all things,

 hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never fails.

 If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing;

 if tongues, they will cease;

 if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.

 For we know partially and we prophesy partially,

 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.

 When I was a child, I used to talk as a child,

 think as a child, reason as a child;

 when I became a man, I put aside childish things.

 At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror,

 but then face to face.

 At present I know partially;

 then I shall know fully, as I am fully known.

 So faith, hope, love remain, these three;

 but the greatest of these is love.

“It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you

 and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,

 so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.

 This I command you: love one another.”

May the love and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you,

An anonymous Deep State whistleblower claims that in the phonecall, Trump used the $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky to open a probe into possible corruption involving Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. But the whistleblower had not actually heard the Trump-Zelensky phone conversation, but based his/her accusation on hearsay.

Regardless, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) used the phonecall as the pretext for the House to move to impeach Trump.

The 5-page transcript of the July 25 phonecall confirms Trump’s and Zelenksy’s accounts: Trump made no reference to the $400 million U.S. military aid, nor did he use the aid to coerce Zelensky.

Below is an analysis of the phonecall controversy by a retired U.S. Army officer who is now a licensed attorney in Minnesota and Wisconsin. His practice includes constitutional law issues, and he has significant experience drafting and arguing motions in both State and Federal Court of Appeals.

The legal analysis below is in the form of an email I received from the attorney. I have his consent to publish, but his identity must remain anonymous.

1. It is unquestioned that Biden, as a sitting VP, took his son Hunter (apparently on gov’t transport) to first Ukraine and then China or that, after each visit, Hunter Biden gained significant economic advantages (as in managing a $1.5B fund in the latter case). Hunter Biden has zero experience in East Europe or China, and no experience in either company’s type of opertions. He was a board member, and board members do not necessarily have either of these, but Biden as a lawyer was really only useful to them (from a professional knowledge point of view) WRT US operations and laws pertaining thereto. 2. [Joe Biden] Using government office to gain economic advantage for family members [Hunter Biden] is at least arguably and I assert positively is corrupt under existing statutes. 3. The President is head of the Executive, which carries exclusive power to conduct foreign relations. No other branch of government has this power. (Do not confuse the Senate’s Advise and Consent responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs – the Senate must advise and consent to completed treaties but has zero role in negotiating those treaties, at least as a matter of law.) 4. The President as Chief Executive is chief law enforcement officer of the USA. As such, he is empowered – I would argue obligated – to investigate corruption, especially at high levels of government. 5. Item #1 constitutes probable cause for an investigation of Biden for corruption. 6. As Executive, the President is the ONLY official authorized to request foreign assistance in a corruption investigation (he may delegate this power). 7. Obtaining foreign cooperation in investigations of corruption by a US official is a matter of statecraft/diplomacy, ie, a function of foreign affairs. No (or very few) rules apply. The President has the sole power here. 8. CONCLUSION: Trump not only is entirely within his powers to use foreign aid as a means to persuade Zelensky to investigate the Biden affair, I believe he was obligated to do so (qv #4). The fact Trump may obtain – and certainly expected to obtain – political advantage from the investigation is simply irrelevant as a matter of law.

There is also the inconvenient-to-Democrats matter of a treaty between the United States and Ukraine on cooperating to prosecute crimes. See “1998 US-Ukraine treaty on mutual assistance in criminal matters proves it’s another Democrat witch-hunt“.

The meeting was described as a prelude to involving President Barack Obama in the discussion.

“Our government is still operating from outdated beliefs and policies” Mitchell wrote in the email from 2014, in which he requested “a conversation with you and President Obama regarding the next steps in extraterrestrial disclosure for the benefit of our country and our planet.”

Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, said the information needed to be disclosed to allow humans to achieve“planet sustainability generation energies,” as well exploring the cosmos without reverting to “colonialism and destruction”and as a way for the government to respectfully regard “the wisdom and intellect of its citizens as we move into space.”

In the email, Mitchell claimed that the US government made a conscious decision 50 years ago to “remove knowledge of the extraterrestrial presence from the citizens of our country.” This decision is no longer relevant, according to Mitchell, who said it is detrimental to “science, religion, and responsible citizenry.”

Podesta’s assistant, Eryn Sepp, accepted the invitation, but said, “John would likely take this meeting alone first before involving the President.”

The former astronaut, who died earlier in 2016, had communicated with Podesta via email before, warning him of an impending space war as well as Vatican knowledge of extraterrestrials.

Podesta, who is heading Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, is known for his UFO fervor stating earlier this year that he had convinced Clinton to declassify UFO files if she takes power. In 2002, he openly advocated for the public release of documents on Area 51.

In the latest batch of emails released by WikiLeaks, Podesta was asked by author and Apollo museum curator Robert Fish to discuss how “hard scientific data” can be collected on UFOs.

“Based on significant personal experience, I can attest that UFO hunters are looking in the wrong places.” Fish told Podesta in the 2015 mail.

Podesta declined to meet with Fish, but said he will keep his contact information."

From his 1961 speech …

To his issuance of Executive Order 11110 President Kennedy saw something very profound, and wanted to convey it to all Americans. He was in the process of standing up to a power he both feared and hated, but was assassinated before any finalization of his plans to take back America. Anything that had been started was quickly disassembled by his Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson, who immediately took control as President, being sworn in on the plane back to to Washington, the same plane carrying Kennedy’s body and horrified wife Jacqueline. In retrospect there were many individuals and institutions who might have wanted John. F. Kennedy dead, because he challenged the elitist more than any president since our founding fathers. He slipped into the Oval office by a mistake in their judgement, and that has never happened since. From that time on every president has been hand picked, and that is a truth very hard to swallow, and denied by most.

It is suggested that President Kennedy might have been assassinated by The Federal Reserve, or the conglomerate banking systems that dominate both Europe and America, and after viewing these videos you may be more able to formulate an option.

Executive Order 11110 was the attempt to bring back United States notes backed by silver, returning to the Treasury Department the Constitutional power to issue debt-free currency. It is suggested that this would have usurped the Federal Reserve, but not all are in agreement. Some very intellectual writers have proposed the accusations to have no merit, some calling the thought fallacious, but one has to weigh just what was at steak at the time, the very domination of the world, and the complete takeover by international banks, corporations engaged in the military industrial complex, and the very control of congress by AIPAC, the Council of Foreign Relations lobbyists, and others.

To see the relevance of these claims one must understand Austrian economics, as taught in our higher learning institutions. Ludwig von Mises’ (1881-1973) “A treatise on economics Human Action” is the primer for this understanding. The link above will bring the reader to the first paragraph of the introduction to the scholar’s edition where it is explained both graphically and collectively.

A complete analysis of Executive Order 11110 is located here. Written by the renowned G. Edward Griffin, the One World Government conspiracy expert. In his writings he has completely debunked the notion that Executive Order 11110 could have destroyed the FED.

From the Federal Register found here, one can see that Executive Order 11110 amended EO 10289 (http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/10…)

However, it remains a fact that JFK was assassinated five months after EO 11110, and his very poignant address to the nation as well. The following is a powerful account of the process.

From The Final Call, Vol. 15, No.6, On January 17, 1996

“On June 4, 1963, a little known attempt was made to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of it’s power to loan money to the government at interest. On that day President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order No. 11110 that returned to the U.S. government the power to issue currency, without going through the Federal Reserve. Mr. Kennedy’s order gave the Treasury the power “to issue silver certificates against any silver bullion, silver, or standard silver dollars in the Treasury.” This meant that for every ounce of silver in the U.S. Treasury’s vault, the government could introduce new money into circulation. In all, Kennedy brought nearly $4.3 billion in U.S. notes into circulation. The ramifications of this bill are enormous.

A nation that is afraid to let it’s people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of it’s people. 

 John F. Kennedy

Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men.

The 8-year-old Ocasio-Cortez impersonator, known as ""Mini AOC,"" has received a series of death threats from ""liberal"" activists, according to reports.

The young girl's family has been forced to stop producing content impersonating Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) after allegedly becoming overwhelmed by harassment, doxxing, and death threats from the Democrat congresswoman's supporters.

Ava Martinez was propelled to internet fame with a series of hilarious viral parodies poking fun at the Democratic socialist lawmaker.

The videos were apparently too much to bear for some liberal activists, however, who attacked the young girl with a torrent of online abuse.

On Wednesday, a Twitter account purportedly run by a parent of Martinez posted: ""Ava will not being [sic] doing any more MINI AOC content.

""The Left's Harassment and death threats have gone too far for our family.

""We have been getting calls on our personal numbers.

""For our safety and for our child's safety, we deleted all Mini AOC accounts.""

The Instagram account for Mini AOC had been pulled down as of this writing, and all content from the purported parent's account had been deleted with the exception of the message notifying its 90,000 followers that the harassment had become too much.

OANN's Jack Posobiec reported that the official Twitter account for Mini AOC had also been removed from the platform.

""What a world we live in,"" one Twitter user said in response to the news.

""No problem making fun of, harassing, threatening our President, but if you make fun of AOC you get death threats.

Ava, aka “Mini AOC,” took social media by storm earlier this year by shredding the celebrity Democrat with her uncanny impressions.

In her videos, the child actress dons a look similar to the New York lawmaker – lipstick and glasses – matching Ocasio-Cortez’s inflections, and ""like totally"" mocking what some say are the real AOC’s child-like propositions.

Ava's stepfather, Salvatore Schachter, posted the first video to social media, and it was an instant viral hit.

“Like, I want to talk about, like, climate change,” Martinez said in one of the spoofs.

""Because, like, there’s no doubt cow farts are making the climate change.

“Like, in July, the climate was 96 degrees and in February the climate was 36 degrees.

""OMG, like that’s a huge change in the climate!” she added.

In the 1984 sense of the matter, this kind of “freedom” really is slavery to a system where the State believes it is God.

This is coming to America in a number of ways, but certainly through Obamacare, where technocrats try to sell us on the argument of rationed health care, where cost-benefit analysis determine the value of individual human lives. Kurt Nimmo points this out in his article today, “Democrats Crank Up Death Panel Talk Following Obama Win.”

Here is just one except from that article:

In September, a top Democrat strategist, Steven Rattner, said rationing under Obamacare is inevitable. “We need death panels,” he wrote for the New York Times. “Well, maybe not death panels, exactly, but unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing, by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget.”

Fabian Socialist, eugenicist and playwright George Bernard Shaw famously stated:

 “I also made it quite clear that Socialism means equality of income or nothing, and that under socialism you would not be allowed to be poor. You would be forcibly feed, clothed, lodged, taught, and employed whether you like it or not. If it were discovered that you had not character enough to be worth all this trouble, you might possibly be executed in a kindly manner; but whilst you were permitted to live you would have to live well.”

Wuhan has recently seen a drastic decrease in numbers of new cases and many are quite excited.

According to Xinhuanet a Chinese news source, no new infections of the novel coronavirus were reported Wednesday in Wuhan itself. This, for those who are not aware was the place where all of this began and thus the ‘epicenter of the epidemic.’ Total confirmed cases on that day remained at 50,005 and 67,800 in Wuhan and Hubei. This is a huge feat.

Xinhuanet wrote as follows on their website:

No increase was observed in the province’s number of suspected cases, which fell to zero on Tuesday, in another indication that large-scale transmissions have been suppressed at the epidemic ground zero.

Previously, the central Chinese province had reported single-digit increases of new infections, all of which were from Wuhan, for a week in a row since last Wednesday. A month ago, the figure was several thousand a day.

The province also saw 795 patients discharged from hospital after recovery on Wednesday, reducing its caseload of hospitalized patients to 6,636, including 1,809 in severe condition and 465 in critical condition.

With no new cases in Wuhan, the Chinese mainland on Wednesday reduced the increase in domestic transmissions to zero. The country now faces a greater threat of infections imported from overseas, which jumped by 34 on Wednesday.

The clearing of new infections in Wuhan came earlier than previously predicted, but it is still too early to let down our guard, said Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and one of the leading experts advising on the epidemic fight in Hubei.

Since being first identified back in December this virus has made serious progress and is affecting people across the globe. As this pandemic continues many are quite concerned and within reason. However, learning of things like this gives us all hope.

While nowhere near enough is known about this virus, we are learning more each day and in time will be able to more properly fight things. China has been seeing a decline in numbers of patients since mid-February, and we can only hope things continue to get better. Strict lockdown during early infection stages seems to have helped the country tremendously.

Technology Review wrote as follows on the topic:

Cause for optimism? The news from Hubei offers a glimmer of hope, and perhaps some lessons to governments on what works. The main one seems to be the need to put affected populations on strict lockdown at an early stage. This happened in Wuhan: it’s still the case that only those with special permission can travel in and out, and people are instructed to stay inside their homes. This order will be lifted only if no additional cases are reported for two consecutive weeks, according to Li Lanjuan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. It is still possible that cases in Hubei will rebound when authorities eventually relax the lockdown.

A grim milestone: The virus’s epicenter is now arguably Italy, which is set to surpass China’s number of coronavirus-related deaths—3,250—this week. The region of Lombardy has been by far the worst-affected region, with hundreds of people dying every day.

While we do not know if there will be another wave of infections to come within the area, we are all hoping the worst of it has already been seen. For more information on all of this please check out the video below. Continue to do your best to remain safe no matter where you are and keep those who are dealing with this in your thoughts as you go through your daily lives."

As skeletons continue to come crashing from Barack Obama's murky closet, details have emerged about a White House meeting between the then-presdient and ex-FBI chief James Comey, where the pair allegedly ""hatched"" a plot to frame the incoming POTUS Donald Trump as a ""Russian spy.""

According to investigative reporter Mollie Hemmingway, Obama and Comey met two weeks before President Trump's inauguration and began ""hatching"" the plot that would become the ""Russian collusion"" hoax.

Hemmingway discussed the contents of the meeting during a Monday appearance Monday Fox News’s “The Ingraham Angle.”

Speaking to host Laura Ingraham, she slammed the mainstream media’s slanted coverage of a conspiracy that’s at the heart of the Democratic Party’s efforts to overturn Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election victory.

Hemingway told host Laura Ingraham that the now-infamous Jan. 5, 2017 meeting in the Oval Office started as a larger meeting.

As Hemingway described it, the meeting got down to nuts and bolts after Obama asked those present who would be departing office when his administration ended to leave the room, keeping then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and Comey behind.

Both Yates and Comey would be serving after Trump took office.

Also present were then-Vice President Joe Biden and then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice, according to Western Journal.

“And that’s where they started hatching their plan to make sure that the incoming administration would not find out what they had been doing or what they planned to continue doing in terms of spying on the Trump campaign and people affiliated with it,” Hemingway said.

And the primary objective of protecting those secrets was targeting then-incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, a man whose prosecution on an absurd charge of lying to the FBI was dropped last week in a dramatic decision by Attorney General William Barr.

Hemingway also used the Ingraham appearance to slam the mainstream media’s coverage of the whole “Russia collusion” story.

In particular, NBC’s disgraceful Chuck Todd disgraced himself and his profession — again — on Sunday by using a deceptively edited video of AG Barr as material for discussion about the Flynn case.

Considering Todd’s show is called “Meet the Press,” the clearly deliberate deception was more than a little ironic.

Todd’s comment was worse: “I was struck … by the cynicism of the answer.”

And alert Americans are floored by the cynicism of the media.

Hemingway’s comment to Ingraham about the video summed it up perfectly.

“This is an example of what has been going on for years, where the exact opposite of the truth keeps on getting reported,” she said.

""And they just keep on suppressing information.

""This idea that Attorney General Barr, by caring transparently about the rule of law, doesn’t care about the rule of law while the people who lie on 302s [FBI interview report forms] or destroy 302s … who destroy evidence, who illegally spy on the Trump campaign with these warrants that were ill-gotten, who illegally interview people.

""That’s not rule of law. That is a problem.”

The events of the past three years prove her point.

As it turned out, Yates and Comey were not to remain in office long under the Trump administration.

Yates was fired at the end of January 2017 for refusing to enforce Trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim countries with deep ties to terrorism.

Comey, of course, was fired in May 2017 over his handling of the Russia collusion probe.

But the seeds had been planted by then.

Understandably enough, Trump is using his considerable Twitter following to get the word out about the new revelations.

There’s no downplaying how much the distraction of the Mueller probe hindered Trump’s first years in office.

Nor is there any downplaying the extent of the anti-Trump media’s collusion in the Democratic Party smear job.

If there had been no Mueller probe, there might well be no House Democratic majority today, since the Mueller probe was still very active during the 2018 midterms.

And with no House Democratic majority, there would have been no ludicrous impeachment of the president.

Those are developments that haven’t just slowed Trump’s agenda — they’ve hurt the country, both at home and in the eyes of the world.

It all goes back to that Jan. 5 White House meeting, and the Obama administration holdovers who got their orders there.

But it couldn’t have gone far without the support of the mainstream media, “where the exact opposite of the truth keeps on getting reported.”

Greyerz explains, “More and more countries are trying to go away from the dollar, and I think the days of the dollar are counted. I think the dollar is going to start falling rapidly in coming months and years. Of course, it already has fallen dramatically in the last few decades, but that will now accelerate. It will go down to its intrinsic value which is zero, which most currencies do over their lifetime. Of course, we have the movements in Russia and China with alternative currencies for commodities like oil, etc. There will be a very disorderly reset with currencies falling. They can’t all fall at the same time, but they will fall dramatically, and gold will, of course, reflect that. The stock markets are in a bubble, and they will also fall. I think the secular bull market we have seen is finished. Now, we are going to see a very long bear market. Of course, the biggest bubble of them all, where governments do all they can to keep the bubble going, is the bond market. We have more debt than ever and interest rates at zero. That just doesn’t add up.” Greyerz goes on to say, “You can’t have governments borrow more than ever and have interest rates at zero. You can only do that temporarily because you have governments printing money and artificially holding interest rates down. That will not last either. So, the reset will be dramatic. It won’t happen overnight, but there will be events that trigger short term pitfalls, but this is a long term thing.”

Greyerz also predicts, “There will be one event after another, and instead of all the good news we have seen . . . now, we will see just bad news coming out. Sadly, we are just at the end of a major era.”

Greyerz is predicting the end of the U.S. dollar era, and you don’t need a total abandonment for the dollar to crash globally. Greyerz says, “In any market, you don’t need big sellers to change the price dramatically. It is always the marginal buying and selling that can make a dramatic difference. . . . If there are sellers and no buyers, that market will collapse.”

Printing money to support the stock market and the bond market will work for a while, but Greyerz warns, “The ammunition that they have will, of course, be so devalued that nobody will want it. So, any support they try to muster in the future will have no effect. This is why markets are going to be in a terrible state in the next few years. It will be all the bubbles that have been created over a very long period.”

On the Swiss Gold Referendum coming at the end of November, where the Swiss will vote for gold backing to their currency, Greyerz says, “Let’s first say that the government is against it. So, they are in the “No” camp and so is the Swiss National Bank. They are not supposed to campaign officially in these kinds of referendums, but they still are making clear statements that it is dangerous for the Swiss National Bank to lose its powers to . . . manipulate the market. So, the “No” camp are afraid they will lose the power to print money, and manipulation of markets is going to be taken away from the Swiss National Bank.” Greyerz goes on to say, “It’s too early to call it, but I would say we stand a very good chance. I am firmly in the “Yes” camp, and I am a great believer in this fight for sound money.”

If it isn’t one toxic ingredient, it’s another. While mercury-containing thimerosal may not be widely used in vaccines these days, that doesn’t make Big Pharma’s inoculations any safer. Aluminum is a common vaccine ingredient — and it’s typically used as an adjuvant in order to purposely agitate the immune system. Unsurprisingly, there is a substantial body of evidence which indicates that aluminum is a potential health hazard.

In spite of the obvious, aluminum remains at the top of the vaccine ingredient food chain. The pharmaceutical industry even has federal agencies like the CDC going on pro-aluminum propaganda campaigns to convince the masses that it is safe.

Assurances about the safety of vaccines and vaccine ingredients is essentially meaningless, however, given that most of the industry-led vaccine “science” is fake. However, not all research on vaccines is bad. There is still some reputable evidence to be had, even if Big Pharma tries their best to bury it.

While aluminum may be abundant, that does not mean it is safe for injection. Writing for Waking Times, John Rappoport points to Children’s Health Defense and their science library as one of the best resources for individuals looking for real science on vaccine ingredients and safety.

Rappoport points to three separate studies from 2016, all of which point to the various harms aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can cause. As Rapoport reports, in a paper for the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, Neil Z. Miller writes:

“Infants and young children throughout the world receive high quantities of aluminum from multiple inoculations. Incremental changes to the vaccination schedule during the past several years significantly increased the quantity of aluminum in childhood shots. Numerous studies provide compelling evidence that injected aluminum can be detrimental to health. Aluminum is capable of remaining in cells long after vaccination and may cause neurologic and autoimmune disorders. During early development, the child’s brain is more susceptible to toxins and the kidneys are less able to eliminate them. Thus, children have a greater risk than adults of adverse reactions to aluminum in vaccines. Millions of children every year are injected with vaccines containing mercury and aluminum despite well-established experimental evidence of the potential for additive or synergistic toxicity when an organism is exposed to two or more toxic metals.”

Across the board, independent researchers seem to agree that aluminum has a great potential to cause harm. Specifically, scientists say that aluminum exposure can lead to neurological and autoimmune disorders. Infants and young children are at the most risk, due to the high number of vaccines they receive in such a short span of time.

Aluminum is used for many things, but few people know that as a metal, aluminum is neurotoxic. Earlier this year, scientific research confirmed that aluminum accumulation in the brain can cause autism.

This is big news because vaccines contain lots of aluminum — and past evidence has shown that aluminum has a real tendency to accumulate in the brain and central nervous system. The accumulation of metals in the brain is also believed to cause Alzheimer’s disease later in life.

Research from 2016 also shows that some infants may be at an increased risk of being exposed to an unsafe amount of aluminum via vaccines. This puts babies at an even higher risk of being maimed by way of inoculation — and these days, Big Pharma is pushing to vaccinate kids more often and at much younger ages.

Even the federal government has admitted that aluminum is harmful to humans and that the most susceptible target for aluminum in the human body is the central nervous system. In addition to autism, aluminum exposure has been linked to other neurological deficits, autoimmune conditions, respiratory problems and more. Clearly, aluminum is not “safe” by any means.

This arrangement failed stupendously in 2016 and the establishment has spent the last three years trying to unseat an elected president they revile and want to be removed from office, even if the interloper must be assassinated. Now that the dysfunctional efforts by Democrats to remove Trump by way of impeachment have failed, the president may indeed have an unfortunate accident or be offed by a “lone wolf” patsy if it looks like he will be reelected.

The establishment desperately needs to insert one of its own into the White House. The Iowa Caucus, despite its hilarious malfunction blamed on a smartphone app, hoisted Mayor Pete Buttigieg to the top of the heap, although we know many ground-level Democrats prefer the socialist Bernie Sanders.

As The Grayzone documents, Mayor Pete appears to be a CIA asset. He worked with the agency in Afghanistan and the national security folks endorse his campaign.

In addition to assisting the illegal occupation and murder of tens of thousands in Afghanistan, CIA Pete teamed up with the DEA, the federal agency responsible for untold misery and murder in its failed war on (some) drugs.

There DEA has not stopped the record flow of heroin produced from Afghan opium into the United States. During the bankster engineered “subprime crisis,” illegal drugs floated the banks. This was pointed out by none other than Antonio Maria Costa, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, more than a decade ago.

“In 2004, the proceeds of the Afghan heroin trade yielded an estimated global revenue of the order of 90 billion dollars. This estimate was based on retail sales corresponding to a total supply of the order of 340,000 kg of pure heroin (corresponding to Afghanistan’s 3400 tons of opium production).” Michel Chossudovsky wrote in 2005.

The Taliban—created whole fabric by Pakistani and USG intelligence—is routinely blamed by the propaganda media as the source of the world’s illicit heroin supply. Left out of this wild distortion of reality is the fact the Taliban worked with the United Nations to eradicate the cultivation of opium. The Bush neocon invasion reversed this trend.

Mayor CIA, if the following tweet can be believed, has an interest in Afghanistan’s wealth of natural resources, the sort of minerals the neoliberals are addicted to stealing, never mind the staggering cost in human life.

I have long argued the CIA is by far the most subversive force at work in the USG and around the world. It has performed as a hitman and violent regime change facilitator for the national security state beginning with the presidency of Harry Truman. It captured the major news media in the 1950s—the “Mighty Wurlitzer” of propaganda—and influences Hollywood media productions and video games, thus thoroughly brainwashing the public with lies and disinformation (nobody beats the CIA at “fake news”).

The CIA vets governors and other politicians. This was substantiated by the former governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, who was visited by CIA spooks shortly after taking office. “On occasion CIA officers meet with senior state government officials, as they did in this case, to discuss issues of mutual interest,” admitted CIA Spokesman George Little in 2008.

More accurately, no doubt, such visits—in this case by nearly two dozen agents—are designed to scare the hell out popularly elected politicians not vetted by the elite.

Mayor Pete the former CIA operative is a near-perfect candidate (although I am betting the full weight of DNC will fall behind the control freak billionaire Michael Bloomberg or a late entry Hillary Clinton). Pete is said to be a homosexual. He fully endorses the identity politics agenda, and he has stated repeatedly he will steal the firearms of law-abiding Americans, although he cannot beat Bloomberg on this count (former Mayor Mike also wants to dictate what you can eat and drink).

The CIA, of course, is not liberal, or conservative for that matter. It covertly supports whatever political ideology it believes will effectively bamboozle politically naive Americans. Identity politics fits the ticket.

Philip II of Macedon and later Niccolò Machiavelli understood the most effective way to undercut the threat posed by political opposition is divide and rule (divide et impera). This is precisely what we are now enduring—a wholly artificial war between statist factions that is rending the political and social fabric of America and distracting it from real issues.

The national security state and its master of subversion, lies, and murder must recapture the White House and Congress—sweeping away the unacceptable on both the right and left—and although Mayor CIA probably will not be nominated, a similar person will be selected and appointed. Bernie Sanders will be cheated out of the nomination for a second time and Elizabeth Warren’s promise to address crony corporate influence in government will be paved over with the insipidity of identity politics that completely ignores the locus of our rapidly approaching serfdom–the financial elite.

Meanwhile, the wars, wholesale theft of natural resources, and mass murder will continue.

In light of new evidence that has emerged clearing Dr Wakefield of the allegations that he fabricated study data involving MMR vaccines and symptoms of autism, Dr Wakefield is now publicly demanding a retraction from the British Medical Journal and author Brian Deer. Documents just made public reveal that another medical research team which included a senior pathologist independently documented evidence of a possible MMR vaccine – autism link 14 months before Dr Wakefield’s paper first appears in The Lancet— based on several of the same children appearing in Dr Wakefield’s study. (http://www.naturalnews.com/031116_D…)

These documents include detailed clinical notes describing the pathology in seven children following MMR vaccination. These notes include references to “autism” and chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, among others.

This evidence, which was just made public, refutes the accusations of fraud leveled against Dr Andrew Wakefield by the British Medical Journal and reporter Brian Deer. This evidence was made available to the BMJ before the publication of their accusations, but they chose to ignore it. Dr Wakefield, in essence, has been falsely accused by the BMJ in what is now being widely recognized as a political witch hunt against the most visible researcher questioning the safety of MMR vaccines.

The BMJ, in essence, has been caught pulling off what may be the largest scientific fraud ever perpetrated by any medical journal in the history of the world. It grossly misrepresented the facts in falsely accusing Dr Wakefield of fabricating the clinical trial data that led to his landmark study being published in The Lancet in 1998. The innocence of Dr Wakefield has now been established by these newly-released documents.

The British Medical Journal also failed to disclose that its own finances are largely funded by vaccine manufacturers who fill the journal with paid advertising, and that such financial ties may have influenced the journal’s decision to attempt to destroy the reputation of a researcher whose findings threatened the profits of its top sponsors. If you follow the money in this story, in other words, it leads right to the editors of BMJ, whose salaries are effectively financed by vaccine manufacturers. This all-important conflict of interest is almost never discussed in the mainstream media, by the way.

In light of the evidence that has now been made public, clearing Dr Andrew Wakefield of any wrongdoing, Dr Wakefield is publicly demanding that the BMJ issue a full retraction of its Brian Deer article accusing Dr Wakefield of fabricating the data. His statement is entitled, “Uncovered Documents Prove There Was No Fraud in Lancet Case Series” and is included here in its entirety:

Uncovered Documents Prove There Was No Fraud in Lancet Case Series

British Medical Journal and Sunday Times author Brian Deer misrepresent facts in latest articles wrongly accusing Dr. Wakefield of altering clinical histories of autistic children

In a series of articles published in the UK Sunday Times and the British Medical Journal (BMJ), written by freelance journalist Brian Deer and BMJ editor Dr. Fiona Godlee (1), I am accused of altering the clinical histories and test results in autistic children in order to manufacture a novel disease – a disease described in The Lancet in 1998 that Brian Deer claims does not exist. I have documents that confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt that I did not falsify this data; that the finding of bowel disease in these children is real; and that these findings were accurately reported in The Lancet in 1998.

The first document (2) describes 7 of The Lancet children and was written by Professor John Walker-Smith in December 1996, 14 months before The Lancet paper was published. Professor Walker-Smith prepared this document in an exercise that, in his words, “was totally unrelated to Andy Wakefield” (3). The document was a report prepared for a scientific meeting, and was based upon Professor Walker-Smith’s own independent assessment of the children’s condition.

He was assisted by a senior pathologist and an expert in bowel disease, Dr. Dhillon, who reported on the microscopic findings in the children’s intestinal tissues. This independent analysis was conducted to a high level of scientific rigor, and are the precise findings reported in The Lancet.

These documents, including Professor Walker-Smith’s report; the transcript of his sworn testimony before the UK medical regulator (2), the General Medical Council (GMC), and the relevant sections of the statement of Dr. Dhillon to the GMC3; were available to Deer and the editors of the BMJ well in advance of their recent publication. (4) They knew, or should have known, that their allegations against me were false. It is clear that the BMJ acted recklessly by failing to check these facts adequately before making their false allegations.

On the basis of this evidence, the British Medical Journal must retract these articles, or face the consequences.

Hemke says, “Look, the system is a total fraud. This pricing scheme was devised in 1974 as a way to diffuse supply. It was to make supply appear more readily available. . . . So, now it’s finally crumbling because people are finally figuring out it’s a scam. It’s a confidence game. You may think you own gold . . . but what you own is just a promise. . . . So, now they are being called on the carpet to try to supply gold. . . . When the day finally comes that this pricing scheme is shattered and 50 people show up to take possession of the same ounce of gold . . . that’s when we find out what the true price of gold is.”

What’s driving the demand for investors to get their hands on physical gold or silver? Look no further than Fed President Neel Kashkari who recently bragged on the TV show 60 Minutes about “an infinite amount of cash in the Federal Reserve. We will do whatever we need to do . . .” to basically save the banking system and the economy from the virus chaos gripping the nation. Hemke contends, “Since this QE to infinity program began Monday, March 23, the S&P is up something like 17%. . . . Fundamentally, there is terrible stuff, but that doesn’t mean the stock market is going to go down because of all of this cash being created, and it’s going into the stock market and everything else. So, when I tell you the stock market is up 17%, it should be no surprise, but gold is also up 14% and silver is up 25% in the last 14 days. That is going to continue. . . . Central banks will always print cash to stop a deflationary spiral. Instead, in an inflationary spiral, currencies will be devalued and gold and silver will go higher.”

Hemke points out the life cycle of any fiat money creation system always ends up going vertical on a chart. Hemke explains, “You’ve got to constantly keep creating money to service all your existing debts. That’s what this system is, and now we are getting to the exponential phase of it. Just like the Covid virus is now getting to the exponential phase. . . . . It’s the same thing with debt. It’s growing exponentially, so the cash needed to service that debt needs to grow exponentially.”

In closing, Hemke says, “Gold has already made new highs in all other currencies except the dollar, but that’s coming. . . . Gradually, over a period of months, gold is going to go to $2,500 per ounce, and that may be orderly, but there will be a time where it will be disorderly.”

Several scenarios are possible, one more optimistic than the other, but the whole system can also go bust. In any case, hard choices will have to be made.

According to the Financial Times chief economist “this is much the biggest crisis the world has confronted since the second world war and the biggest economic disaster since the Depression of the 1930s”.

The collapse of prices in the oil market betrays that the global economy is having a very rough time and that recovery is not going to happen soon. Oil demand is a good indicator of economic activity.[1] Globally, that demand has fallen by as much as a third.

The IMF has just published a report on that economic storm. In the most optimistic case, this year the global economy will be 6.3 percent smaller than was expected before the coronacrisis. Next year, growth would be 2.4 percent higher than expected. In that scenario, an estimated $ 3,400 billion will be lost due to this crisis[2]. That equals the GDP of all countries in South America and one and a half times that of Africa. That seems an awful lot, and it is, but this amount is only one-seventh or less of what is estimated to be parked in tax havens.

In case lockdowns in parts of the world last longer than until June, and if new lockdowns happen in 2021, the IMF estimates the loss at double that (-8% or $ 6.800 billion loss). In the less favorable – but more realistic scenario – government spending in the rich countries will increase by 10 percentage points of GDP and debt will increase by 20 percentage points.[3]

And this is all on the assumption that the entire system will survive. In another report the IMF warns:

The world’s total debt today has reached a record $ 253,000 billion. That is 322 percent of the world GDP. That’s a ticking time bomb. But what is even more worrying today are the risky credit market segments. This means junk bonds,[4] leveraged loans[5] and bespoke private credit. After the crisis of 2008, central banks pumped a lot of money into the financial markets (so-called “quantitative easing” or QE). This, together with extremely low interest rates, has led to a huge financial bubble and to the creation of today’s many zombie companies and banks[6].

According to the IMF the value of these junk credits has risen to an incredible $ 9,000 billion. If this starts to collapse and tops the loss of the other thousands of billions of dollars as a result of COVID-19, the 2008 crisis will be a snap in comparison. Not without reason the IMF says: “This crisis is like no other”.

So there are three scenarios: an optimistic (which actually boils down to a major depression), a less optimistic and a real crash. In each of those scenarios, a tremendous amount of money will be needed to stem the crisis and recover.

The key question is where this money should come from. Who will pay the bill? There is not much choice. Either the working population or the outrageously large fortunes. The former will lead to enormous impoverishment, with all possible political consequences, and will plunge the economy even deeper into the crisis due to the further decline in purchasing power.Editor in chief of The Financial Times Rana Foroohar focuses on the matter:

In other words, COVID-19 has thoroughly shaken up the balance of powers. The financial and economic elites are on the defensive. An economic model where profits take precedence over people’s well-being and health is no longer sustainable. The time is ripe for fundamental social changes for the benefit of the people who keep our society afloat during the corona crisis. Introducing a corona tax will be essential, but only just a beginning. Much more than that will be necessary. In any case, these are exciting times. Get ready.

[1] The stock markets are not a good indicator at the moment because they are artificially boosted by the gigantic amount of money that central banks are pumping into the capital markets. This is one of the reasons why bond market interest rates are very low, leading speculators to turn to the stock market.

[2] For next year, growth is estimated to be 2.4 percent higher than normally expected. Together this will result in a loss of 3.9 percent. Out of a total of $ 87,000 billion, this equates to $ 3,400 billion.

[3] For example, instead of a government deficit of 3 percent of GDP, this will amount to 13 percent. Instead of debt of 100 percent of GDP, this becomes debt of 120 percent of GNP.

[4] In order to get money (for investing), a company can issue shares, borrow money from the bank or appeal directly to savers by issuing a bond (debt certificate). The buyers of that bond are, in effect, lending money to that company and are receiving interest in return. A junk bond is a risky bond. Interest is high, but so is the risk that the loan cannot be repaid.

In 2016, I coined the term “journo-terrorism” to describe the fear-based deranged “journalism” being practiced by out-of-control left-wing news propagandists like CNN. Today, CNN just confirmed they are the leader in journo-terrorism by stalking an elderly woman in her own front yard, “doxxing” her on a live broadcast, and accusing her of being a Russian puppet.

The Russia collusion “derangement syndrome” of fake news CNN is spinning so out of control that I’m calling for a criminal investigation of CNN reporter Drew Griffin for harassment and inciting violence against an elderly American.

“A private citizen received online abuse after CNN tracked her down and publicly shamed her for unknowingly sharing a “Russian-coordinated event” on her Facebook page,” reports Breitbart News. “While filming the woman, who runs a pro-Trump page on Facebook, CNN publicly shamed her for ‘unwittingly’ promoting a ‘Russian-coordinated event.'”

For the record, it was actually CNN and MSNBC who promoted a Russia-organized event in New York, according to recent Robert Mueller indictments. Yet CNN has no desire to investigate itself for functioning as puppets for Vladimir Putin.

“Following the incident, conservative commentators criticized CNN for tracking down and attempting to publicly shame private citizens,” reports Breitbart News.

Mark Dice: “Stop harassing people at their homes, you psychos!”

CNN “doxxes” the woman who then receives a wave of horrid abuse from deranged left-wing lunatics and Trump haters

As part of its absurd “news” harassment of this elderly woman, CNN actually broadcast her full name, which is unique enough that people were then able to determine her home address. She also received threats of violence from CNN followers, reports Breitbart:

The woman also received violent threats, with one user warning, “stay in Florida, you come to NY and I’ll kick your Russian bot ass.”

CNN has become a dangerous terrorist organization that stalks old ladies to blame them for Hillary Clinton losing the election

This isn’t the first time CNN has stalked private citizens in acts of journo-terrorism. “In July, the cable news giant hunted down a man who posted a meme on Reddit poking fun at the network,” reports Breitbart. The pressure resulted in the man eventually apologizing to CNN.

But CNN apologize to no one; not for exploiting dead and traumatized children to push its radical anti-gun agenda, nor for stalking and harassing an elderly woman on her own front lawn, accusing her of colluding with the Russians.

Remember, too, that CNN is engaging in all this insane, deranged, lunatic behavior to desperately try to promote a fictional narrative that claims “the Russians” stole the election from Hillary Clinton. To this day, CNN still can’t accept the fact that Hillary was a horrible candidate who remains widely despised by informed, intelligent Americans.

Truly, the utterly fabricated left-wing “Russia collusion” hoax has become a dangerous delusion among left-wing activists (pretending to be journalists). They’re now running around the country, accusing everyone who opposes them of either being a Russian co-conspirator or a Russian bot. Deranged lunatic Adam Schiff — who belongs in a straight jacket — has been desperately pushing “Russian bot” fantasies for weeks, enabled of course by a complicit, clueless media.

CNN isn’t just at war with America; it’s at war with REALITY

Many of us are now coming to the astonishing realization that CNN is at war with reality, and there’s no tactic too low or too far for the journo-terrorism network to invoke. Just yesterday, CNN’s Communist-In-Charge Chris Cuomo falsely claimed that a 20-year-old purchased an AR-15 with an expired ID. In truth, the young man didn’t purchase an AR-15 at all, but walked around a gun store with an expired ID and got a picture of himself holding an AR-15.

From this, CNN’s Cuomo declares the young man “purchased” the AR-15, even though the guy openly says he didn’t purchase it and left the store empty-handed. When confronted over his blatantly false “fact,” Chris Cuomo doubles down on the lie and can’t even recognize actual events that collide with his own internal mental delusions.

Truly, CNN reporters no longer recognize reality at all. Actual events taking place in the real world “do not compute” in the twisted minds of CNN propagandists pretending to be journalists.

Isn’t it time to yank CNN from all the airports across America?

It begs the question: Why on Earth is CNN still being broadcast across U.S. airports? Why hasn’t CNN been banned from Google News for pushing years of fake news rooted in journo-terrorism tactics? Why hasn’t Twitter banned CNN’s account for gross violations of its terms of service (harassing elderly women surely qualifies as a violation, does it not)?

The answer, of course, is that CNN is the leading propaganda front for Trump-hating, anti-American globalist forces that are attempting to dismantle America piece by piece. “No network has shown their leftist leanings more than CNN, which has gone into full blown overdrive in their around the clock anti-gun coverage, with the first 7 articles on their homepage, including their featured story, all attacking the NRA and promoting leftist gun control causes,” writes Alex Thomas for SHTFplan.com.

“…[T]he entire establishment is conducting a massive psychological campaign against the NRA and the tens of millions of gun owners across the United States. This includes the supposedly non-partisan Florida school shooting survivors who have parroted Democratic talking points for the last week.”"

As long as there have been positions of power, there have been those courageous few willing to speak truth to power. And as long as there have been those willing to speak truth to power, there have been those trying to throw them in jail.

As the invention of the movable type printing press spread literacy to the masses and paved the way for newspapers, pamphlets, and broadsheets, the idea of the free press as a “fourth estate” began to take shape. This concept of news media as a vital check on institutional governmental power was taken to heart by America’s founding fathers, who took care to preserve freedom of speech, and the freedom of the press in particular, as a contitutionally-enshrined right in the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights.

…or so the story goes. In point of fact, tyrants have always strained against a truly free and independent press and it was less than a decade before the Federalists under President Adams began to eviscerate the First Amendment. In 1798 they passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, criminalizing “scandalous” or “malicious” criticism of the government. Under the laws, which lasted until their expiry in 1800 and 1801, over 20 newspaper editors were arrested and several imprisoned.

If this story tells us anything, it’s that the war on the free press is nothing new. But even given this “proud” American tradition, the overt threat to journalistic truthtellers in the US and around the world, even from within the ranks of journalism itself, is reaching a fever pitch. (see this and this and this and this)

As worrying as this attack on the free press is, more worrying still are the proposed political “solutions” to this problem. Among them is the so-called “Free Flow of Information Act,” spearheaded by Senator Diane Feinstein and approved by the Senate Judiciary committee in a bipartisan vote in September. This bill purports to “protect” journalists from having to reveal their confidential sources in federal court. In reality, it allows the government a back door for defining what does and does not constitute journalism, a disturbing precedent that is the first step down the slippery slope toward censorship of criticism from unrecognized and non-establishment media entities like the report you are currently watching.

Given the high stakes involved in defining “journalism” during this age of internet journalism and the explosion of alt media sources, it is no surprise that many in that alternative media are perceiving this as a direct attack on their ability to perform the task of countering official government propaganda.

Earlier this week, Michael Vail of alt media news websites StratRisks.com and BlackListedNews.com joined me to discuss this war on journalists and its ramifications.

The term “war on journalism” is an apt description of the current state of affairs because there is a war being waged on the public right now. It is a war for the hearts and minds of the population, and it is being waged by the bought-and-paid for government and the compliant repeaters in the corporate controlled dinosaur media that is bleeding readership and viewership as alternative entities increasingly dominate the information battlefield.

The metaphor is now so common that it is routinely employed by the power structure itself, who now readily admit that they are losing that information war.

The problems facing modern society are complex and manifold. They span the political, economic and social spheres, and together constitute a nearly overwhelming challenge to the creation of a just, peaceful and free society of the future. But of all these problems, the threat to journalism is one of the most fundamental, and one of the most fearsome. For if the very ability to voice opposition and criticize the increasingly tyrannical aims of a government out of control is removed from the people, what hope is there of ever achieving true change?"

Meanwhile, Deep-Staters in the Trump administration, led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, are planning wars against Venezuela, Iran, Syria and Russia. Attorney General Bill Barr indicted Venezuelan President Maduro as a narcotics terrorist, which will make an attack by the US appear to be praiseworthy. -GEG

Keep your eye on Pompeo! President Trump is understandably distracted by the coronavirus outbreak in the US but in the “never let a good crisis go to waste” mode, the neocons in his Administration – led by Pompeo – are launching their war plots without the normal scrutiny. Venezuela, Iran, Syria, Russia – the long knives are coming out. Trump has been able to put the kibbosh on Pompeo’s plans before, but a distracted Trump is in danger of losing control of his foreign policy. Launching a foolish war in the midst of the current crisis would surely spell disaster for the president. Watch today’s Liberty Report:"

During a conversation with Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel Capital and host of the podcast The Portal, Rogan steered the conversation towards 2020 politics.

Below is the partial transcript:

ERIC WEINSTEIN: I think that in general people, when they are given no choice at all, express themselves moronically. JOE ROGAN: When they are given no choice at all — How so? WEINSTEIN: I want a choice of an actual president that’s viable. I don’t have one. Now you’re going to ask me which of the none-viable people do you like best? ROGAN: This is the real issue with the Democratic Party. They’ve essentially made us all morons with this Joe Biden thing.

WEINSTEIN: I can’t vote for him; I can’t vote for Trump. ROGAN: I’d rather vote for Trump than [Biden]. I don’t think he can handle anything. You’re relying entirely on his cabinet. If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can’t do that. And we don’t know what the fuck he’ll be like after a year in office. The pressure of being President of the United States is something than no one has ever prepared for. The only one who seems to be fine with it is Trump, oddly enough. He doesn’t seem to be aging at all or in any sort of decline. Obama, almost immediately, started looking older. George W. [Bush], almost immediately, started looking older.

Last month, Rogan voiced his concerns about Biden's mental stamina, declaring that ""Trump is going to eat him alive.""

The podcast host predicted that President Donald Trump would beat the former vice president during live debates because Biden ""can barely remember what he’s talking about while he’s talking.""

Rogan also showed clips of recent interviews - where Biden fumbles and appears confused - to illustrate his point.

“You have to be able to call out s**t that’s wrong on your side,” Rogan explained.

Earlier last month, the Trump campaign trolled Biden with an embarrassing video compilation of his struggles on the campaign trail.

The video begun with CNN’s Ana Cabrera saying, “Obama warned Biden’s aides to make sure didn’t embarrass himself.”

House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn called for the cancellation of Biden's remaining 2020 primaries and debates to protect him from saying something that he “cannot overcome.”

“I think when the night is over, Joe Biden will be the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, and quite frankly, if the night ends the way it has begun,"" Clyburn told NPR."

Many of us have known about the corruption, misleading science, and lobbying power of the pharmaceutical industry for years now and many of us have complained about it to anyone who would listen. But hearing Dr. Abramson admit he cannot answer the question honestly because he is being “watched” should make anyone reconsider their blind trust of the CDC and Big Pharma.
• NBC NEWS: Here’s one reason flu vaccines are so lousy (Yes that is the title of NBC Nat’l News- Verbatim!)

What do Mandatory Vaccines have to do with the Nuremberg Code?

In 2015, California removed the personal exemption for vaccines, making them a requirement for kids who wanted to attend public school. But now many other states are attempting to follow the same path.

“The industry pushes mandatory vaccine laws and schedules despite a lack of medical research on the risks of this rigorous and unforgiving approach, while many vaccine injury stories point to the serious harm it may cause over time. Considering that these vaccines can inflict injuries ranging from mild to severe (like most other pharmaceutical products) making them mandatory is patently against the Nuremberg Code, critics say. The code is an important one to say the least. A set of ethical rules regarding medicine, which came out as a result of the horrors of World War II, one of its main principles is that the patient must give their consent to anything done to them.”

No one is arguing that science is bad. Or that wanting to protect our children and the most vulnerable among us is bad. However, I’ve said it before and I will keep saying it: one size does not and cannot fit all. The current CDC schedule includes over 60 doses of different vaccines, a significantly larger number of vaccines than the previous generation used to receive.
• Ghost in the Machine, Part 1 — Drug safety and media shaped by Big Pharma

And Big Pharma doesn’t show signs of letting up anytime soon, even though the science on their effectiveness and safety is woefully incomplete. (And what is available, is “oftentimes written or sponsored by the drugmakers themselves.” )

In the video below, Dr. Abramson discusses the epidemic problem of “commercialized” drug research:

Currently, if a child is injured by a vaccine, the family’s only option is a multi-years fight in family vaccine court. And most aren’t even compensated. However, even in the rare cases of compensation, the companies responsible pay no penalty. At all. They continue to walk away from the damage they have done, scot free.
• Who does the Childhood Vaccine Injury Act protect?

Until our choices to vaccinate are set in stone, and unless and until we can sue Big Pharma for the damage their vaccines do, we must continue to stay vigilant.

Now, she is not so sure one can be avoided. Fitts explains, “In theory, it is easily possible to manage through the election. It doesn’t have to blow up, but if you look at what is going on in the campaign and in Washington, the leadership is blowing up. If the leadership doesn’t manage it properly, anything is possible. I think what the global economy and the U.S. economy needs is the rule of law. So, if we have to have this conversation to bring an end to this secrecy and privilege and get back to the rule of law so we can support productivity, then I say let’s have a mess. I’d rather deal with our civilization and our governance system now than later. The sooner we get back to productivity the better.”

Fitts also says, “I used to have a pastor who used to say ‘God does not bless a mess.’ We have a mess, a pyramid of lies that goes on and on and on, and it’s a mess. So, could the mess implode? Yes, it could implode. Here’s the reality of where we are going. I think we are in a long-term bull market . . . . The one thing the world cannot afford is if we bring the Constitutional covenant down. That’s why I think the conversation going on in America right now is so important. . . . The Constitution is a 6,000 year miracle, and if that miracle fails, there will be anarchy in the world. So, to me, the most important thing right now is to reaffirm the covenant of the principles we affirmed during the Revolution. The last thing we need is Rubio, Jeb Bush or anybody calling for a Constitutional convention to balance the budget on the backs of the people who just had $40 trillion stolen from them.”

So, are criminals running the U.S. government? Fitts, who is a former Assistant HUD Secretary, says, “Yes. . . . The American government . . . is running the central banking warfare model globally, and it depends heavily on criminal profits. If you look at the general population, the general population supports that. . . . The general population supports that as long as they can pretend they don’t have responsibility for that. If you look at the drug trafficking, the mortgage fraud, stuffing innocent people into prison, that is being implemented one county at a time in 3,100 counties. There are millions of Americans getting paid to put a pretty face to it. . . . The party with the debt growth model is over, and that means the party is over for a lot of people who are unproductive.”

Fitts contends there is some very good news if we can get rid of the criminal cronies. Fitts explains, “The wealth potential is enormous. One of my favorite quotes is from founding father John Adams. He said the war was not the revolution. The war was the consequence of the revolution. The revolution was in the hearts and minds of the people and their assumptions of their obligations to each other. So, for people to take responsibility, they need to know the truth. The leadership for many decades now has said the American people are too stupid and too dumbed down to take responsibility . . . or to be involved with solving the problems. I don’t agree with that. I agree with Winston Churchill, and he said, ‘Tell the people.’ If you tell the people what the real problems are and give them the tools . . . the wealth potential with new technologies and where you have rule of law where people believe in an economy where winners are allowed to happen. . . . Wow, it could be incredible.”

 Here’s the April 2014 update from The Keenan Group…

NEIL KEENAN UPDATE | Global Accounts Under Attack – The Keenan Team Is The Only Thing In Their Way, And We’re Not Going Anywhere



 It seems like many years ago we started this journey that some describe as going down the rabbit hole. I have always referred to it as going down the yellow brick road because now we can finally and clearly see the city that hides the psychopathic criminals who call themselves the New World Order (NWO).

 They want us to believe that they are human beings yet they don’t have natural human feelings – except that they do love to hate. Facts bear the truth: they live and thrive on inflicting torture, pain, disease and death on humanity and Earth’s creatures. In order to perpetuate their malevolence, they have assembled themselves into one degenerate group aimed at acquiring the world’s finances. They do not, and cannot, let go of their financial control of this world because it would mean their end. Having illegally seized major assets from the Global Accounts twice, the NWO is attempting for a third time to hijack the Accounts. Their ultimate plan for these finances is to fund another 60 years of war, strife and disease and bring the Earth’s population down to a controllable number of less than one billion slaves.

 But on the other hand, we are in the control seat right here, right now. Imagine how they would react if we all turned and stormed their bastilles? They are now looking out of their fortress windows in fear, wondering when we are going to tear down their gates to get to them. Yes, we are coming, and we will deal with them as they wished to deal with us. The fewer of them, the fewer problems We The People have. Count on us coming; and count on it being sooner than the next lousy motion picture flop about humanity’s destruction (Noah).

 Be warned: watch your back and watch your doors! Remember the Cease & Desist that we fed you this past month? The long list of your crimes against humanity is there for all to see. The world knows exactly what you are doing, and we are here to stop your insanity!

 This past month the war has begun. It may not have begun in earnest in the West, but the war against the theft of the Global Accounts and the world’s finances has started, and is at full speed ahead here in the East.

 No idle threat: Fire! – We beg you to burn.

 Video Highlights:
• Swissindo and OPPT have renewed their efforts to steal funds that are not theirs. Swissindo has falsely included in their worthless documents the names of people who have no involvement with them whatsoever to support their scam publicity stunt which took place in Hong Kong and Indonesia. If their efforts were real it would be a case of the bad boys of the West merging with the bad boys of the East.
• Recently two men were caught by the Vatican police with counterfeit bonds worth at least $3.1 trillion. The thieves are known as Count Albert Zvonko Berdik (not our Count Albert!) and Owen Thomas Lennon, who both had UN diplomatic immunity status, and were attempting to open up a line of credit with the Vatican bank. When their hotel room was searched, there were other counterfeit notes found along with stamps and seals used to make the forged notes. Had they been successful, it would have added trillions more to the Vatican’s already overflowing coffers, thereby perpetuating and strengthening their crimes.
• Connecting some of the dots: Swissindo’s con game, the two men caught with fake bonds, families increasingly being approached to sign off on their accounts, George Soros most recent visit to Indonesia — these are all indicators pointing to the imminent release of the Global Accounts.
• Our heartfelt condolences go out to Rick Light with the recent passing of his wife. RIP Robin Light – may you watch over and guide our patriot Rick Light.

On Friday YouTube announced it was removing ads from running on some anti-vaccine videos, claiming that the videos violated its policies against “harmful or dangerous” acts. And you can thank BuzzFeed News for this because they brought the videos in question to YouTube’s attention. (According to BuzzFeed, some advertisers “objected to their products being associated with vaccine opponents.”1)

YouTube’s current policies prohibit ads from appearing on videos that promote “anti-vaccination content,” (this means the video makers make no money off of them the way other YouTube video creators share in ad revenue) but YouTubers who are pro-science and medical freedom- like us- can still generate revenue via merchandise promoted on the platform or if they solicit donations. Something I have NEVER DONE. I’ve even turned down huge amounts of money in funding. I bankrolled my own site without a dime from anyone.

“We have strict policies that govern what videos we allow ads to appear on, and videos that promote anti-vaccination content are a violation of those policies. We enforce these policies vigorously, and if we find a video that violates them we immediately take action and remove ads.”1

BC – In Part II of a Special 3-Part program, independent scientist Leuren Moret, MA, PhD ABD, confirms that U.S. Government and Jesuit controlled HAARP under President Barack Obama in coordination with the Vatican, monarchies and Zionist banking networks are creating polar vortex and nuclear typhoons filled with Fukushima radiation that is then dropped on the northern hemisphere populations, especially targeting the United States people.

Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, is employing Russian HAARP to lay an electromagnetic fence around Russia to keep out plumes filled with Fukushima radiation, thereby protecting the Russian people from depopulation. Putin is also constructing BRICS, a banking model in competition with the Rothschild-dominated private debt-based fiat-currency, a prison for humanity.

In Part II of her interview, Leuren Moret summarized key methodologies of the depopulation plan that the Matrix elites have undertaken. The equation determining the Depopulation rate is:
• HAARP to bring Fukushima via polar vortexes to targeted populations, mainly Northern Hemisphere
• Transhumanist Agenda – All aspects of the Transhumanist Agenda to robotize humans
• Next generation EMF generators – such as weaponized transmitter Light poles

GEOENGINEERING AND HAARP GLOBAL NUCLEAR GENOCIDE: Polar Vortex wind patterns forming in the North Pacific Nov. 10, 2014. After loading up on Fukushima radiation earlier in the week, two nuclear vortices moved into the north Pacific and headed for the Arctic region. The one on the right (below Alaska) moved down the west coast of the US, contaminating the food baskets of Canada and the US. The second nuclear vortex formed the Polar Vortex that moved down the middle of Canada and the US, then turned east to contaminate the entire US east of the Rocky Mountains. It is obvious that certain global regions were protected from radiation exposure by HAARP heating, creating high pressure zones over Russia, Korea, China, and Central and South America. This wind storm image confirms that Fukushima radiation from Japan, and the tsunami debris field stretching across the Pacific, serve as radiation sources for nuclear typhoons and storms thrown at North America. Accelerated genocide is the desired endpoint.

Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, is on the brink of collapse as its healthcare system is unable to keep up with the demand for hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to ignore the imposition of even the most common sense anti-coronavirus measures, such as social distancing and the wearing of face masks in public.

Sao Paulo mayor Bruno Covas has stated that the city’s public hospitals have reached 90 percent of their capacity and could run out of space for new COVID-19 patients in as little as two weeks.

Covas further stated that the people of Sao Paulo who were disobeying lockdown protocols were guilty of “playing Russian roulette” with other people’s lives.

The state of Sao Paulo is one of the hardest hit regions in Brazil by the Wuhan coronavirus. As of press time, it has 63,066 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 4,823 deaths. (Related: Brazil now on its way to becoming Latin America’s coronavirus hotspot; Manaus now a land of the dead.)

Mayor of Sao Paulo plans to introduce strict lockdown measures to protect hospitals

“The city is coming to the limit of options,” said Covas to journalists on May 17. “We need to decide if we want to test the limits, or if we will be prudent and firmly maintain social isolation for the time needed so that the health system doesn’t collapse. We are closer than we would like.”

The state of Sao Paulo, the epicenter of the Brazilian coronavirus pandemic, has been under a state of lockdown since March 24. All businesses, schools and public spaces were shut down and people were ordered to stay at home. While this lockdown seemed strict on paper, the penalties for breaking quarantine were not severe, and plenty of Brazilians still chose to leave their homes, which helped spread the disease. Even the mandatory rule of wearing face masks has been flouted.

Government data showed that in March, at the beginning of Sao Paulo’s lockdown, more than 60 percent of residents sheltered at home and the spread of the virus had slowed down. However, in the last few weeks, the amount of people in Sao Paulo who were following quarantine protocols had fallen below 50 percent and the coronavirus began spreading more rapidly throughout the city.

Furthermore, maintaining quarantine has been difficult for the residents of the city’s favelas, or slums, who have to keep going to work in order to maintain a regular income.

Sao Paulo Gov. Joao Doria began relaxing the state’s lockdown restrictions on May 11. However, it seems that residents of Sao Paulo city may have to wait a little longer; Covas stated that he has been in talks with Doria over implementing even stricter lockdown measures to prevent hospitals from reaching breaking point.

Coordination between the mayor and the governor is necessary because the state government controls the police, and their support will be necessary if the plan to maintain the lockdown continues.

The city of Sao Paulo, one of the largest in the world, has a population of 12 million, and data from the Brazilian government shows that most of the city’s residents are ignoring social distancing guidelines.

Meanwhile, Bolsonaro continues to be criticized for his disastrous handling of the country’s coronavirus pandemic. He has been spotted several times participating in rallies. He has stated that the threat of COVID-19 is being “overstated” and that it’s nothing more than a “little flu.” When asked about Brazil’s mounting death toll, he responded by saying “So what?”

On May 17, he defied global health advice even further when he posed for photographs with supporters and their children.

In another engagement, he met with a group of men who were wearing similar military outfits. The whole group, including Bolsonaro, said a prayer for Brazil and then dropped to the ground and did several pushups.

Bolsonaro continues to ignore the threat of the coronavirus and has repeatedly called for Brazil to reopen its economy. He has even argued that most of Brazil had nothing to fear from COVID-19.

“With my history as an athlete, if I were infected with the virus I would have no reason to worry,” said Bolsonaro. “I would feel nothing, or it would be at most just a little flu.”

Brazil currently has 254,220 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 16,792 deaths. The country now has the third highest number of coronavirus cases, next to Russia and the United States. It is also one of the few large countries in the world where infection and death rates are still rising.

Never one to mince words, talk radio legend Rush Limbaugh said point-blank Wednesday evening during an appearance on Fox News’ “The Story” with Martha McCallum that Hillary Clinton not only should have been indicted by the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller but that she should be wearing prison stripes by now.

Limbaugh’s comments come on the heels of unbelievably arrogant statements made by Clinton during an appearance at Time magazine’s annual snooze fest ‘gala’ celebrating the washed-up magazine’s “Top 100” ‘most influential’ people of 2018.

“I think there is enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts certainly would have been indicted,” Clinton said regarding Mueller’s ‘finding’ during his sham investigation that POTUS Donald Trump never “colluded” with Russia to ‘steal’ the 2016 election — or that the president “obstructed justice” in firing the man who cleared Hillary, James Comey.

“I’m really of the mind that the Mueller report is part of the beginning…because there’s still so much more that we should know and that we should act upon,” Clinton — who seems to think she is still in government pulling strings — continued (what’s this “we” business?). “And we’re a long way from knowing because we need to get the full report — the unredacted version.”

What chutzpa. But then again, this is arrogance born out of the fact that as a Deep State elitist, she knew from the outset that Comey was never going to recommend she be indicted for her criminal mishandling of classified emails via her home-brew server…that Obama knew about. (Related: What did Obama know about Trump collusion hoax and when did he know it? Everything, and from the beginning.)

She knew that as a member of the DC Swamp in good standing, she was never going to be held to the same accountability she claims POTUS Trump must now be held to.

Will Clinton EVER be brought to justice? Maybe…

It was all too much for Limbaugh, who recounted the various ways in which Hillary Clinton should not now, at this time, be breathing free air.

Hillary “needs to be investigated, she needs to be indicted, and she needs to be in jail.”

Clinton, Limbaugh noted, is the one who really “tried to rig a presidential election” by working through the Obama regime to co-opt the most corruptible members of the FBI, the Justice Department, and U.S. intelligence.

It was Clinton’s campaign, he noted, that paid for the bogus “Russia dossier” — which used Russian sources quoted by former British spy Christopher Steele and was eventually used to justify spying on a member of the 2016 Trump campaign, Carter Page.

“Hillary Clinton and her pals in the Obama Justice Department and the FBI, they are the ones who colluded with the Russians, they are the ones that gave us this entirely, totally bogus Steele dossier,” Limbaugh continued.

“You talk about irony? For Hillary Clinton to be talking about impeaching Donald Trump — Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated, she needs to be indicted, and she needs to be in jail,” he added. “And many of her co-conspirators in this whole sordid affair, which amounted to nothing more than a silent coup to overturn the election results of 2016.”

The conservative talker went on to point out that Clinton has been twice rejected by the American people — once when she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama in 2008 and again when POTUS Trump beat her.

“She is the last person who ought to be listened to about what ought to happen to Donald Trump!” he asserted.

Truth bombs, one and all.

Will Hillary ever get hers? Time will tell, but there are continuing investigations into the roles played by Deep State actors — Hillary included — to steal the election from Trump.

Racism amongst the rebels including at command level

In a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, journalist Sam Dagher pointed out the obvious fact that the Libyan war is aggravating ethnic tensions in that country. The article talks about the fate of Tawergha, a small town 25 miles to the south of Misrata, inhabited mostly by black Libyans, a legacy of its 19th-century origins as a transit town in the slave trade:

Other rebel leaders are reported as:

In addition, according to the article, as a result of the battle for Misrata:

Amid allegations of black mercenaries and stories of mass rape by the inhabitants of Tawergha, Sam Dagher reports on further evidence of the racism amongst the rebel forces:

Some of the hatred of Tawergha has racist overtones that were mostly latent before the current conflict. On the road between Misrata and Tawergha, rebel slogans like “the brigade for purging slaves, black skin” have supplanted pro-Gadhafi scrawl. The racial tensions have been fueled by the regime’s alleged use of African mercenaries to violently suppress demonstrators at the start of the Libyan uprising in February, and the sense that the south of the country, which is predominantly black, mainly backs Col. Gadhafi.

This information has already been publicised, not just in the WSJ but also in the Black Star News

This video shows two men from Tawurgha captured by the rebels and interrogated for the cameras:

Disturbing as this video is – there are other absolutely horrific videos apparently showing public lynchings in Benghazi and Misrata.

The myth of black mercenaries leads to lynchings

Other evidence of the massacres of black people, which include the lynchings and murder of black soldiers of the Libyan army, guest workers from other African countries and dark-skinned Libyan civilians include a report from the BBC on 25 February which cited a Turkish construction worker as saying:

“We had 70-80 people from Chad working for our company. They were cut dead with pruning shears and axes, attackers saying: ‘You are providing troops for Gaddafi.’ The Sudanese were also massacred. We saw it for ourselves.”

On 27th February Nick Meo of The Telegraph reported from Al-Bayda that he had been shown mobile phone footage of a ‘captured mercenary‘ (presumably he means black person with a uniform) lynched from a street lamp as well as a ‘black African hanging on a meat hook.’

Amnesty International crisis researcher, Donatella Rovera spent the period from 27 February to 29th May in Misrata, Benghasi, Ajabiya and Ras Lanouf. Yesterday she was interviewed by Austria’s ‘The Standard’ and had this to say on the subject:

“We examined this issue in depth and found no evidence. The rebels spread these rumours everywhere, which had terrible consequences for African guest workers: there was a systematic hunt for migrants, some were lynched and many arrested. Since then, even the rebels have admitted there were no mercenaries, almost all have been released and have returned to their countries of origin, as the investigations into them revealed nothing.”

Who spread the myth and why?

So what accounts for the widespread popularity of this myth? It is, to be frank, an example of highly successful propaganda, appealing to the basest of racial stereotypes. The myth was highly important in gaining consent for the operation in Libya, in order to cover up and justify the massacres of black people taking place.

The myth of black mercenaries was spread by certain political leaders and bodies including the National Transitional Council in Benghazi, British Defence Minister Liam Fox and NATO spokesperson Oana Longescu .



 

 According to Amnesty, allegations of “African mercenaries” have led to the lynchings

On the viagra myth, beloved of the ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, Donatella Rovera had this to say:

“No one really took that seriously did they? On the 21 March, after the first air strikes on Gadaffi’s troops outside Benghazi, a young man who worked in the media centre presented us with many boxes of the potency drug. He claimed to have found them in the destroyed tanks. The vehicles had been completely burnt out, but the packaging looked brand new. I can not believe that anyone took him seriously.”

So is NATO actually “protecting civilians” – or is it rather supporting rebels, some of whom who intend to harm dark-skinned Libyans and ethnically cleanse areas over which they take control?

The information contained in this post, is widely known and has been reported in the Independent and other newspapers, so NATO can not claim ignorance of the facts.

As this is being written, the”brigade for purging slaves and black skin,” is advancing on Tawurgha, supported by NATO strikes from the air and on the ground by Special Forces. A rebel commander has declared the intention is to wipe the town off the map and we have already seen the lynchings of black people and the driving out of black people from Ghoushi.

By continuing to escalate the conflict in Libya, allowing the arming and supporting the rebel side, providing bombing support to enable them to advance and refusing to implement a cease-fire as demanded by the United Nations and African Union, NATO is enabling serious abuses of human rights and NATO officials will certainly be held to account."

Way back in 2014, we warned you of the then-new trend of ‘Christian yoga‘ that had begun to make inroads in the large, liberal mega-churches across America, and we told you about something called Kundalini Yoga that is designed to awaken the ‘serpent spirit‘. Very few of you heeded our warnings and now here we are two days away from a new year and a new decade, and Christian yoga is everywhere, it’s a thing, as they say. And so is Christian witchcraft. So what does this have to do with Kanye West’s Sunday Service and Facebook? Plenty.

“Abstain from all appearance of evil.” 1 Thessalonians 5:22 (KJV)

Portal from Facebook is a new technology product that combines video calling, digital assistant Alexa, and a Smart Camera that automatically tracks your every movement so you can move about freely during the call and it never goes out of focus. The official blurb from Facebook:

So we found it interesting that the first ad for Portal from Facebook featured Jennifer Lopez having a video call with Kanye West’s wife Kim Kardashian, with Mrs. West sitting in the middle of a very New Age meditation triangle. the kind so favored by satanists and occultists. Not only that, but we see Mrs. West lighting candles prior to entering into the triangle, itself a portal into the demonic spirit world. To repeat, Portal from Facebook features Mrs. Kanye West ritualistically lighting candles before entering into a meditation portal for a Kundalini yoga session where there serpent spirit is awakened.

Kim Kardashian is a New Age witch, as this Portal from Facebook commercial obviously shows you, with its various references to the Illuminati, Freemasonry, satanism and the occult. So it looks like the “radical Christian revival” being led by Kanye West and his Sunday Service has not influenced his wife in any meaningful way. In fact, did you know that it was witch Kim Kardashian who came up with the name Sunday Service, and the one directing Kanye West to go public with it? Now ask yourself, why would a witch want to do that? 🤔 It’s simple, really.
• RELATED STORY: The Kardashians Say That Being a Witch Is A Lifestyle Choice

As we warned you from the beginning, Kanye West and his Sunday Service deception is just that, a deception designed to pull as many Christians away from the truth of the Bible as possible. Kanye and Kim have worked hand-in-hand with the Illuminati from the beginning, have become fabulously wealthy as a result, and now the ‘rent has become due’ and they are being used as part of the end times spiritual deception. So no, I will not be buy Portal from Facebook any time soon, because I have no desire to enter into the actual portal they are pushing, the one that New Age witch Kim Kardashian is sitting in.

In an ad dripping with references to Freemasonry, the Illuminati, satanism and the occult, New Age Witch Kim Kardashian is selling Portal from Facebook.

Courageous Former Commercial Pilot Joins The Fight To Stop Geoengineering



My name is Willem Felderhof and as a former commercial airline pilot the issue of geo-engineering and weather modification has my full attention. It took me a while though before I “saw” that there was something completely wrong at the “office”. In 2009 I received an email of a friend who requested my view on the “chemtrail” phenomenon. And with an open mind I answered him that, apart from the motivations behind these programs, seen from my perspective, experience (10.000+ flight hours) and technical knowledge of commercial airliners, it was highly doubtful that these programs would exist. But from that moment I started to do more research and more important I analyzed the skies more with awareness. I didn’t take long before the blinders dropped from my eyes. I was mostly shocked by the fact that there was no uprising under the pilots and meteorologists whose job it is to observe, analyze, study and anticipate on weather phenomena like cloud formation, structure and dynamics.

Geoengineered skies are now the norm all over the world

But on the other hand, due to my history as a whistleblower, a 10 year battle against the airline industry over toxic air IN the airplanes, I was familiar with the dynamics and mechanisms so it did not surprise me either. And since pilots often have a big ego, the fear of being labeled as a “conspiracy theorist” and being casted out of the group has more priority than the future of our children and/or Mother Earth.

Nozzles are clearly visible mounted on the pylon directly behind the jet engine exhaust stream

I think anyone who did thorough research on the issue of geoengineering understands the direct and imminent threat for the future of humanity and/or the planet itself. And by realizing that fact, our individual goals for prosperity and personal happiness can be parked a side. It is time to awake the inner warrior, NOW, and start acting in order to stop insanity at work.

There is a multidimensional war going on against humanity and Mother Earth, and geo engineering is a multi layered weapon of mass destruction in this war, period. Not only that, geo engineering and weather modification programs are used by the powers that be to create l a solid legal framework for setting up a one world government.

The good news is that the psychopaths in power are in panic and that’s why they are pushing their agenda into overdrive. And because of this, their pathetic programs become more blatantly visible for anyone who is willing to see it. The current increase of highly toxic programs like geo engineering and weather modification programs are actually a boost for the global awakening. And like New World Order architect Zbigniew Brzezinski stated, this global political awakening is the greatest threat for the global power structures and their insane agenda’s towards full spectrum dominance. This global awakening not only offers us the possibilities to protect ourselves against these vicious attacks (I will publish an article soon, explaining ways to protect yourself against these attacks in a powerful way), more important; it forces us to take immediate action in order to stop and reverse this madness. One of the actions will be to hold those in office accountable for abuse of office, and for performing politics that are a direct threat to national and international security.

Blanket spraying of highly toxic geoengineering aerosols is occurring around the globe over land masses and oceans

Regarding geoengineering, people ask me very often what they can do about this. Simple: do research as much as you can, become aware and more important: act upon it!

On an individual level I am preparing a presentation on geo-engineering/SRM/weather warfare and electro magnetic radiation and how these programs work in conjunction with each other. And then I will just travel around in Europe. I do not have any clue where it goes but it will create momentum for sure.

Besides this I am busy setting up a legal framework in Europe to start legal action. For this I am looking for people who are willing to take active stand in this fight against geoengineering. You are more than welcome to join and take an active role in this crucial battle. Especially people with knowledge of European law, pilots, and meteorologists are most welcome. But again, anyone is needed. We have to join forces NOW. It’s ridiculous to waste more time before starting to save the future of our children and the beautiful planet Earth.

Please contact me for more information about what you can do and how to help in our strategies in the fight against geoengineering in Europe.

Understand that the Eastern Alliance only wants a world of mutual cooperation and progress, instead of waging endless wars that benefit no one but the ruling bloodline that is also responsible for the deteriorating quality of life in the West.

Donald Trump talks incessantly about “draining the swamp” in reference to political corruption and lies in America.

It is a constant commitment designed to shore up support among the poor and dispossessed who have suffered from broken promises and falling living standards for decades at the hands of the political elites who serve big business and the omnipotent and all-powerful military industrial complex which controls and runs America.

The truth is he has no intention of ‘draining the swamp’ because he has lived in it all his life alongside the millionaire and billionaire elites he calls friends. Far from draining the swamp President Donald Trump is making that swamp even more putrid and rancid with the stench of lies, privilege and rank hypocrisy that wafts from it daily.

The pathetic mainstream media in the UK has devoted more audio commentary and newspaper space to attacking Jeremy Corbyn for refusing to attend the State Dinner in Donald Trump’s honour last night and agreeing to address the massive protest today in central London against Trump’s visit than attacking the bigotry, racism, misogyny and warmongering.

Donald Trump has earned the scorn, disdain and condemnation of every human being with a basic combination of decency in their hearts and brain cells in their head.

Trump is for Trump and he will do anything and say anything to maintain and promote himself. It is necessary to attack his shocking ignorance of history, politics and world affairs. Detailed analysis of his pronouncements exposes the fact he has uttered 10,000 untrue statements since being inaugurated America’s 45th President. That works out at around 12 lies a day.

One of his recent lies was particularly shameful and shocking but was hardly called out in America and has certainly been ignored by the hired poodles in the UK media who have treated Trump with kid gloves. The argument surrounding abortion is understandably passionate and controversial. Most people would describe themselves as pro-Choice rather than pro-Abortion in recognition of the inalienable right of women to control their own bodies. Legislating against abortion has never and will never stop abortions from taking place. All it does is make abortions more secretive and dangerous. Passions run high on the issue but read what Donald Trump recently said at a rally in Wisconsin and then ask yourself if those comments are worthy of an American President?

​What sort of individual is willing to so blatantly distort the truth in relation to such an emotive issue for personal gain and acclaim? If he believes that depiction represents abortion he is an ignorant person who should be debarred from holding a driving licence let alone the key to the White House.

Trump is the guy who supports and cheer-leads the separation of children from their mothers at border checkpoints.

Trump is the guy who mocks the disabled in public.

Trump is the guy who equates anti-racist campaigners and White Supremacists who deliberately kill and drive into crowds of defenceless and innocent people.

Trump is the guy whipping up hatred by banning Muslims from entering the US and refusing to condemn or even question police officers guilty of shooting and killing unarmed black men.

Trump is the guy who abused women and bought their silence and consistently uses sexist language to undermine any female critics.

Trump is the guy who has overruled the elected House of Representatives decision to ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia in protest at their illegal use of those weapons and litany of human rights abuses. Trump represents the military companies not the innocent victims of war crimes in Yemen.

Trump is the guy imposing deadly economic sanctions on the people of Venezuela in an attempt to overthrow an elected government.

Trump is the guy threatening to attack Iran and spark a catastrophic war with huge consequences for the Middle East and rest of the world.

If you think that guy deserves anything other than outright condemnation and organised opposition then you should seriously assess your moral compass.

Jeremy Corbyn is absolutely right to join the protesters today in opposing this dangerous bigot. Trump may not be a fascist but he certainly displays many of the prejudices and views synonymous with those of White Supremacists.

The media in this country should not be condemning Jeremy Corbyn for addressing the anti-Trump rally today, they should be asking the other so-called believers in democracy and human rights why they are not joining him?"

It is worth reading the following in the discussion about the central banks being private or public/governmental.





The central banks have a supreme central bank, The bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel. It was founded by Rothschild agents Charles Dawes and Owen Young alongside with Hjalmar Schacht of the Deutsche Reichsbank. About this system Bill Clinton´s mentor, member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Professor Carroll Quigley wrote in his book ""Tragedy and Hope"" 1975 , which was based on years of studies in the Archives of that Council: 



""The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far reaching (plan), nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences.

The apex of the system was to be the Bank For International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland*, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations.

Each central bank ... sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the Country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.""

See Andrew Hitchcock ""The History of the Money Changers"", year 1930 on the timeline http://iamthewitness.com/

You write: ""But the Bundesbank, The Dutch CB, the Bank of China and others are public.""

Could you, please, document that?

I have evidence in the opposite direction as for Germany:

 

 From the University of Hamburg http://tinyurl.com/ptzphl9 (in German)

 ""The federal government establishes a monetary and Federal Reserve Bank as a bank..In the context of the European Union, its tasks and powers can be transferred to the European Central Bank that is independent... "" (Basic Law, Article 88).

From the above conceptual analysis, it clearly results that the legal position of The Deutsche Bundesbank is not: partly, the Bundesbank appears in the guise of a monopoly enterprise producing bank notes, sometimes in the guise of a dealer in bank businesses and partly in the guise of an authority or in the guise of an Ltd.

After 1998, the responsibility for the German currency matters has been assigned to the European

So, the Problem is: Who own and who run the ECB?

 The Global Control Grid

 Join Dark Journalist for the exciting Part Two Interview of his deep discussion with Former Assistant Housing Secretary and Financial Expert Catherine Austin Fitts. In this fascinating episode Dark Journalist and Former Assistant Housing Secretary Catherine Austin Fitts explore the Transhumanist agenda that covert forces are pursuing to install a global control grid. Is the elite endgame a dismantling of the constitution and a major play for complete dominance by the use of suborbital platforms using invasive satellite surveillance technology? 



 Transhumanist Depopulation Agenda 

 Fitts arrives at the conclusion that the transhumanist depopulation agenda extends to mandated vaccines that are linked to autism and the creation of shadow financial system that is engaged in a 'War on Cash' and is focused on drawing the public into a control system under the nebulous title 'The Internet of Things'. 



 The gradual development of this centralization is reaching a crescendo as the 2016 Presidential contest enters a crucial phase and Neocon Democrat Hillary Clinton attempts to consolidate the Deep State around her candidacy against upstart casino billionaire and TV star Donald Trump.

466,True,The article suggests that Pope Francis's call for a ban on all weapons is part of a calculated remark designed to pave the way for a new globalist agenda or disarming America and possibly the entire world.,True,The article mentions Pope Francis as the actor who is calling for a ban on all weapons.,True,The article mentions that Pope Francis is calling for a ban on all weapons.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects events and specific observations (Pope Francis's call for a ban on all weapons) to an integrated whole by attributing cause and effect.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Pope Francis: 'Ban All Guns Immediately’ For A New Global Unity

Pope Francis took to Twitter yesterday to call for a ban on all weapons amid the continuing gun control debate.

The Pontiff asserted a globalist message of banning firearms in order for humanity to enter into a new world order.



In the past, other religious leaders had called for a ban on certain types of weapons including nuclear weapons.



But Francis has gone one step further and called for an outright ban on ALL weapons.

The comment is either one of naiveté or a calculated remark designed to pave the way for a new globalists agenda or disarming America and possibly the entire world.

In 1982, Pope John Paul II addressed this two-front battle in a speech to the United Nations calling for a peaceful ban on all nuclear weapons.

""To reverse the current trend in the arms race involves, therefore, a parallel struggle on two fronts: on the one side, an immediate and urgent struggle by governments to reduce progressively and equally their armaments; on the other hand, a more patient but nonetheless necessary struggle at the level of the consciences of peoples to take their responsibility in regard to the ethical cause of the insecurity that breeds violence by coming to grips with the material and spiritual inequalities of our world. With no prejudice of any kind, let us unite all our intellectual and spiritual forces, those of statesmen, of citizens, of religious leaders, to put an end to violence and hatred and to seek out the paths of peace.""

Unfortunately, stupid remarks like the tweet today have actually become the foregone conclusion for Pope Francis.

Not only is it quite bad advice, however it undermines the Catholic Church's Catechism.

The Catechism, the official mentor of the Church, acknowledges there are specific times when war is warranted.

The Catechism gives principles for avoiding conflict, but 2309 admits self-defense is often needed.

Pope Francis said on his recent visit to Chile that he was very afraid that the world is now standing at the “the very limit"" of a nuclear world war three.

The Pontiff expressed worry that the human race is just one step away from a devasting nuclear war which could affect everyone on the planet.

2307 The 5th commandment forbids the intentional damage of human life. Because of the evils and oppressions that accompany all war, the Church insistently urges everybody to prayer and to action so that the divine Goodness may free us from the ancient chains of war.105.

2308 All residents and all federal governments are obliged to work for the avoidance of war.

However, ""as long as the threat of war persists and there is no worldwide authority with the required competence and power, federal governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self-defense, as soon as all peace efforts have failed."" 106. 2309 The stringent conditions for legitimate defense by military force require strenuous factor to consider. The gravity of such a decision makes it based on high terms of moral legitimacy. At the same time:.

- the damage caused by the assailant on the country or community of nations should be enduring, dangerous, and particular.

- all other ways of putting an end to it need to have been shown to be not practical or inadequate;.

- there need to be serious prospects of success;.

- Making use of arms should not produce evils and disorders graver than the misfortune to be gotten rid of.

The power of modem methods of damage weighs very considerably in assessing this condition.

These are the standard elements mentioned in what is called the ""simply war"" doctrine.

The evaluation of these conditions for moral authenticity belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have the duty for the common good.

Also, how correctly would this ban be implemented?

Would the United Nations manage the destruction of all weapons with weapons of their own?

Then would this world power be turned over to destroy their own guns voluntarily?

Prohibiting all guns is such an outrageous idea it is not even worth going down the bunny hole attempting to figure out the logistics of it."

I am a service connected Army veteran and suffer from severe depression that came out of no where when I was in my mid 30’s. I get really down when I start thinking we can’t win this battle against their propaganda hold they have over the people.It’s like most people are to busy with their lives and think things are normal. I am still fighting because I have 2 beautiful smart young daughters that I worry about their futures if our Great Republic is taken away from them….Sorry for rambling but just want to thank you for what you are doing and for giving me hope we will win over the globalist.

Our Reply: Buck up, solider! We are fighting a war here….not one that is on the ground with boots and blood, but one of great importance, none the less. We are fighting the Great Information War and we are WINNING. Citizens like us have joined forces all around the world to protect their nations from the encroachment of globalism. We are called by God to do what we can, with the capacities we have, to enlighten and educate those around us. This is the Great Awakening. This is the new world awakening.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell below 25 percent compared to where it started this year and is now the poorest-performing major stock market in the world.

Then there is the trade war with the United States which wiped out a massive $2.4 trillion this year alone, while a deleveraging drive has pinched margin debt to just a third of its height in 2015.

As foreign investors continue to inject money into onshore equities via the stock connects and state funds in an attempt to rescue shares, the still didn't halt declines.

Even safer havens were losing ground as the weak Chinese economy hurt spending and weighed on consumer stocks.

Meanwhile, a vaccine scandal and gene-editing controversy prompted a massive sell-off in the health-care sector.

Here are six charts to sum up the year according to Bloomberg:

Stock declines have shaved $2.4 trillion off China’s market value this year as of Thursday, the biggest on record since Bloomberg started compiling the data in 2002.

The closest loss was during the global financial crisis ten years ago, when the Shanghai gauge plunged 65 percent.

China also ceded its place as the world’s second-biggest stock market to Japan earlier this year.

China's stock market saw the most significant value wipeout since at least 2002

Investors haven’t been this disengaged with stock trading in years. Average daily turnover on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges fell to about 368 billion yuan ($53.7 billion) this year, the lowest since 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

[RELATED] Chinese Billionaire: America Will ‘Suffer More’ Than China In Trade War

Just 239.1 billion yuan of shares traded on Friday, about 1/10 of its peak in 2015.

None of the sectors were safe enough to shield investors from losses. All ten industry groups on the CSI 300 index fell on the year, the broadest decline since 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

That’s a stark reversal from last year when all sector gauges rose.

All ten industry groups on China's CSI 300 Index fell this year

China’s crackdown on financial leverage has achieved some results, at least in the stock market as speculators disappeared.

Outstanding margin debt stood at 756 billion yuan as of Wednesday, as investors grew risk-averse.

That’s about a third of its 2015 peak, when investors borrowed record sums to bet on further gains, fueling the great stock market bubble.

Burnt investors have hit the exit button. A total of 75 Chinese mutual funds with an equity focus liquidated this year, Bloomberg compiled data show -- the most since 2007 when such data became available.

That compared with the 88 equity mutual funds that were liquidated in total over the past 11 years.

New mainland listings usually surge in their early days of trading as regulatory caps on initial pricing makes it a bargain for investors.

Stocks that debuted on domestic exchanges this year rose by an average of 193 percent in their first month of trading, Bloomberg data show.

While that may not seem that bad, that’s just half the return seen in 2016, and it’s also the weakest performance in four years.

Anyone defending the Bill Gates/WHO global vaccine program needs to explain this study: Mogensen et al 2017. Prior to 2017, neither HHS nor WHO ever performed the kind of vaccinated/unvaccinated (or placebo) study necessary to ascertain if the DTP vaccine actually yields beneficial health outcomes. The DTP vaccine was discontinued in the US and western nations in the 1990s following thousands of reports of death and brain damage.

But Bill Gates and his surrogates, GAVI and WHO, made DTP a priority for African babies. The Danish government and Novo Nordisk Foundation commissioned this study by a team of the world’s leading experts on African vaccination. The two most prominent names, Drs. Soren Mogensen and Peter Aaby, are both vocal vaccine supporters. They were shocked when they examined years of data from a so called “natural experiment” in Guinea Bissau where 50% of children die before age five. In that west African nation, half the children were vaccinated with the DTP vaccine at three months and the other half at six months. Dr. Mogenson and his team found that girls vaccinated with the DTP vaccine died at 10 times the rate of unvaccinated kids. While the vaccinated children were protected from Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis, they were far more susceptible to other deadly diseases than unvaccinated peers. The vaccine apparently compromised their immune systems. Thanks to Gates, DTP is the world’s most popular vaccine.

For African nations, GAVI and WHO use DTP vaccine uptake to gauge national compliance with vaccine recommendations. GAVI can financially punish nations that don’t fully comply. The researchers suggested that the DTP vaccine is killing more children than the diseases it targets. It’s possible that millions of children are adversely affected. Although the New York Times and other Gates boosters will accuse me of promoting “vaccine misinformation”, this is a peer reviewed publication in a respected journal by the world’s most authoritative vaccine scientists describing catastrophic outcomes.

Shouldn’t we be scrutinizing Bill Gates’ record in Africa before we let him dictate which medicines we need to take? By muzzling legitimate criticism as “anti-vax”, the media avoids honest debate on many damning studies like Mogensen."

He’s sent to prison, where he writes a book and smuggles it out so the public will know what its government is up to.

In 2011, Scott Bennett was a second lieutenant U.S. Army special operations officer and psychological warfare analyst and worked in the highest levels of counterterrorism, intelligence, and politics in the State Department’s counterterrorism office to catch the bad guys.

When he uncovered that members of his own government were the bad guys, and were financing terrorists, he tried to blow the whistle. Hounded, persecuted, and eventually imprisoned for two years on trumped-up charges, Bennett wrote a book behind bars and smuggled it out of prison. Shell Game: A Military Whistleblowing Report exposes the betrayal and cover-up by the U.S. government and other elements, like the Clinton Foundation, Swiss banks, Saudi Arabia, and over 100 of our own representatives and senators.

Now Bennett is taking what he knows and traveling abroad, most recently to the No. 1 country in the sights of the Zionist war machine: Iran.

Bennett sat down with this newspaper to discuss his background and his time at the New Horizon Conference in Tehran last month. He joined 26 others in the ancient Persian city, including AFP columnist Philip Giraldi, formerly with the CIA, F. Michael Maloof, a veteran Pentagon employee stripped of his security clearance because of his success in finding the links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda (none), former State Department employees Peter Van Buren and J. Michael Springmann, and AFP columnist Kevin Barrett.

“Shell Game is my experience in my report about the massive corruption that was going on,” he explained. “[That corruption] has led to one of the greatest crimes against the American people, specifically the financing and funding of terrorism, these Wahhabi Saudi Arabian terrorists, while lying to the American people and claiming that we’re fighting ISIS, when we’re not.

He continued: “We’re financing them, we’re equipping them, we’re aiding them, we’re training them. We’re giving them visas to come over from Libya to be trained in CIA operations at Fort Bragg. We’re then deploying them back into places like Syria and Libya and Afghanistan.”

Before they locked him up, Bennett submitted his report to the entire Congress. He shared what response he got.

“Not a single one did anything,” he told this newspaper. “Rand Paul was the only person to write me back, twice. He didn’t really do anything significant, but he did write me back acknowledging it. Everyone else ran away from it like a dog with its tail between its legs.”

Bennett walked away from the conference with a greater understanding of his hosts.

“I came away with the understanding this is a wonderful country [and] a wonderful people, and we are completely ignorant of this fact,” he said. “The deep state, intelligence, Zionist operations that have put Iran as the enemy of America, they’re the liars to the American people.”

He added: “The Iranian people are a very peaceful, pleasant people. They are nothing like what the media portrays them as. They are not warmongers, they’re not savages, they’re not violent, they are not chanting ‘Death to America,’ and they don’t hate Americans. All of that is propaganda.”

""So, Nixon and Clinton got treated fairly,"" Levin said on ""Hannity.""

""Trump gets treated worse than a terrorist or mass murder.""

Levin read passages from the Clinton impeachment inquiry, highlighting why the Democrats are treating President Trump unfairly.

Levin also accused the Democrats of trying to push an impeachment trial in the 2020 general election.

""I hear some of these legal...analysts out there going on and on about that's the next stage,"" he said.

""No, I'm afraid not. You didn't have an official vote on an impeachment hearing,"" Levin said.

""This entire thing is the Democrat Party in the House seizing control of the instrumentalities of the House bastardizing the impeachment clause in order to drive a trial into the general election.""

The host also dismissed the testimony earlier in the week of diplomat Bill Taylor.

""We have testimony from William Taylor, who the Hell is William Taylor,"" Levin said.

""All of a sudden he's the great William Taylor because Adam Schiff has annointed his such.""

Levin also blasted the media for their unwillingness to cover House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff's ""secret"" impeachment inquiry.

""Where are these press organizations today when it comes to Adam Schiff keeping the press out of the these secret testimony? These secret hearings? They don't much give a damn anymore, do they?"" Levin said.

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee on Friday demanded that Schiff brought forward his anti-Trump ""whistleblower"" for questioning.

GOP committee members have written a letter to Schiff requesting that the anonymous person who made the August 12 complaint, prompting an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, is brought forward.

A copy of the letter, that was sent to Schiff on Wednesday, was obtained by The Daily Wire.

In the letter, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH), Devin Nunes (R-CA), and Michael McCaul (R-TX) ask why Schiff changed his mind on calling the whistleblower to testify."

Pento has also long said, “This was the biggest debt bubble in history, and it is going to pop someday.” That day has arrived. Now, Pento says, “This is a global depression just like we had in the 1930’s combined with a 2008 style credit crisis. That’s what it is. I was on your program about three months ago, and I predicted a global recession. That was wrong. It is a global depression. . . . We have learned that the S&P 500 earnings will decrease by 10% in the second quarter. We also know that GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for the second quarter is projected to decline by 35%. . . . We also know, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, that the unemployment rate in the United States could surge to 42%. . . . April is going to be a disaster. We are not in a recession, we are in a depression, and it is global in nature.”

Pento also cautions, “So, what do you have left for the month of April? The lockdown is going to continue, and then you are facing a plethora of earnings warnings and economic data that is going to be absolutely horrific. . . . I think the stock market has to go lower for the month of April, and then I think we start to find our legs probably in the summer. . . .We have to get through this lock down, and the news is going to be the likes of which none of us have ever seen before–bad, horrific, rancid . . . It will be the worst economic data ever reported. . . . You are going to see GDP plunge at a 35% annualized rate. That has never happened before.”

As bad as this sounds, Pento says it’s going to get worse, “We are not headed into it–it’s here. This is it, a global depression the likes of which we have never seen before, but this is not the real crash. We are going to come out of this, but we are going to come out of this the wrong way, by borrowing and printing money. . . . But that is not the real crash. The real crash is when you have an inflationary implosion of the bond market, and there is not a darn thing central banks can do about it because you can’t bail out inflation by increasing the rate of inflation. . . . After the inflationary implosion of the bond market . . . . and they realize they are destroying the economy because of inflation, they will throw in the towel, and then there will be bail-ins and resets. We are going to default on the debt two ways. First, through inflation, and that’s going to fail. Then, we are going to deflate and rest.”

Pento also predicts, that in the end, the bond market will collapse, “Yields will rise, bond prices will crash.”

Pento thinks physical gold and silver are some of the “must have” assets. He has also recently doubled his investment in precious metals.

Indeed, the Snopes writer even defended teaching children about the rape of children and suggests that pedophilia is only wrong by “modern” standards…

Let us keep in mind that Facebook uses Snopes as a fact checking resource, and decides from this whether a post on Facebook should be removed (… and a voice silenced). It is easy to extrapolate from this a suspicion that the tech giants may be following the same strategy; blocking those they disagree with, and justifying the block with slanted and false information from the perverts at Snopes.

Does this partially explain the nature of similar blocks on conservative speech by the tech giants like Apple, Twitter, Youtube and WordPress?

One more word about Snopes:

“You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” – John 8:44"

Her life and understanding of how the world operates is confined to two “bubbles,” One in Washington, D.C., the other in San Francisco, California. The “air” inside both bubbles has the stench of Political corruption and fallout from Self Serving actions by an elected official and supposed “public servant.” (Cough, cough… wow, the air is bad in there.)

Not only is Pelosi the “Calendar Girl” (please leave the clothes on) of Liberalism, she is exactly what is wrong with The Political Establishment and why so many ‘left leaning’ voters joined the Republicans and elected Donald Trump as President.

Pelosi would have been retired long ago to the La Brea Tar Pits in Southern California, along with the other prehistoric times, if she and husband Paul had not made and kept promises to the “wealthiest businesses and corporations” with headquarters in SFO. (Homework assignment: Connect the dots between Pelosi and Russian Money) Do we detect some Pelosi vs. Trump hypocrisy?

“Pelosi [..] one of the most liberal members of the U.S. House, where she runs the Democratic caucus, railing against income inequality and the avarice of the 1 percent. But she also happens to be one of the body’s wealthiest members: In Washington, she lives in a multimillion-dollar Georgetown condo; she owns a 16-acre vineyard in Napa Valley and a 3,700 square-foot house in San Francisco’s tony Pacific Heights..”

“.. financial-disclosure statements, [..] place her in the top one-tenth of the 1 percent of Americans, [that] may surprise some in light of the concern she’s expressed about income equality and the distribution of wealth.

“We’re talking about addressing the disparity in our country of income, where the wealthy people continue to get wealthier,” Pelosi said in 2010 at a United Steelworkers’ event. “That disparity is not just about wages alone,” she added. “That disparity is about ownership and equity. It’s all about fairness in our country.”

At this point we are not going to continue pointing out the hypocrisy Pelosi practices in her personal and business affairs as it is available on line to even the most casual researcher. (Have barf-bag at the ready.)

Short and sweet… Nancy calls out Trump about an alleged Russian Connection without talking about hers.

Nancy says Trump is not competent to be President? Really Nancy? (More Hypocrisy)

Let’s take a look at Nancy Pelosi’s “competency” …….

What is this lady on?

Nancy, read the Rx directions. Take only 2 with food.

Wait… we forgot… Liberalism is a Mental Disorder. How unkind and inconsiderate of us to point out the Hypocrisy of our “esteemed political giants.” (choke)

Of these five, only Nigeria did not experience either US air strikes or a military occupation in that year.”

Further illustrating the devastating impact of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Gottinger’s report showed that terror attacks in that country jumped from 208 in 2002 to 11,000 by 2005.

In a Dec. 10 appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz suggested the Middle East was more stable before the war on terror began.

“Now, what has been a mistake — and we’ve seen a consistent mistake in foreign policy — is far too often, we’ve seen Democrats and a lot of establishment Republicans in Washington get involved in toppling Middle Eastern governments. And it ends up benefiting the bad guys. It ends up handing them over to radical Islamic terrorists,”Cruz said.

The following week, Ben Swann, a journalist and outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy, agreed with this assessment, and outlined some of the other ways the war on terror destabilized Iraq:

“Before the 2003 U.S. invasion, do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq? None. In the country’s history there had never been one. But since the 2003 invasion, there have been 1,892.

In Iraq, prior to the start of the Iraq war, there were reportedly just over 1.5 million Christians living in that country. And yet shortly after the war started, more than one million of them fled to Syria. That didn’t work out well. Today fewer than half a million Christians remain and yet are being exterminated by groups like ISIS.”

Millions have died in Iraq and throughout the Middle East as a result of modern U.S. imperialism. Current estimates suggest that at least 1.3 million died in the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

“These figures dwarf the roughly 3,000 people who tragically died in the September 11, 2001 attacks,” Gottinger wrote.

He was right. Hemke also predicted this would be bullish for gold and silver prices. He was right again. Now, Hemke says, unlike the other times, this time, the Fed will not be able to stop the money printing. Hemke explains, “You’ve got to keep printing cash to service all this accumulated trillions and trillions of dollars of debt. You can’t grow your way out of it. You have to print your way out of it. They can’t let the stock market go down. I think it’s a $20 trillion total market cap. If it went down by 25%, it would be $15 trillion. That would be $5 trillion that would just go poof, and now, your liquidity crisis is that much worse. . . . They can’t afford to let it go down because it will exacerbate the liquidity crisis.”

On the China Coronavirus, Hemke says, “It’s bad enough with all the people dying and everything, but this didn’t just get fixed. It didn’t just get cured. There are still Chinese cities that are quarantined. Flights to Hong Kong, even now, are being suspended. All of this is going to impact the global economy . . . and it’s going to make the central banks print even more cash. . . . They cannot afford to let it (stock market and economy) go down.”

Hemke also says, “The Fed is monetizing the debt as we speak, and they will continue to do so. That cash goes into the stock market and makes it keep going up, which they’ve got to have. What people need to understand is this is madness, and it’s only going to get worse, and that is also why you have to own gold and silver.”

Hemke forecasted months ago if gold would hold above $1,550 per ounce, that would be the support the yellow metal would need to launch higher. Hemke says, “The next target will become $1,650, and I think by the end of the year, we will see $1,750 for another pretty solid year. Silver will be $20 to $22 per ounce (by the end of the year). If people really want to make some cash . . . the real opportunity is in the mining shares. . . . Total global asset allocation to the precious metals sector is less than 1%. If it goes to 2%, you have twice as much cash chasing a relatively finite amount of goods. . . . Twice the cash chasing the same amount of goods means higher prices. It’s not that complicated.”

By completely interfering with Earth's atmosphere and life support processes, man has radically altered our planet's energy balance. The climate equilibrium that was so essential to our species (and life as a whole) has been lost. Though there are countless sources of anthropogenic decimation to our biosphere, some sources stand out as the absolute epitome of blatent intentional human destruction and insanity. Mathematically speaking, global climate engineering is the greatest single assault of all against life on Earth. Only nuclear cataclysm has the potential to eclipse the threat posed by climate engineering. Fracking is another glaring example of completely insane human activity. If we are to collectively have any chance of survival, a much larger segment of the population must awaken and join the fight for the common good.

When it is all said and done, President Trump’s stimulus checks will carry an inflationary cost many multiples more than their original $1,200 value in the pre-coronavirus economic reality, a reality that probably won’t become apparent until after the election in November. By then the checks will have served their purpose as a political move, not an economic one. When understood from the vantage point of what is in store for the American working classes as we emerge from this red light on main street, Trump’s checks will only add fuel to the inflationary fire just ahead, according to Neal Kimberley, a macroeconomics analyst for the South China Morning Post.

An economic realignment is unfolding in the wake of the shutdowns prescribed by pandemic response protocols. The coordinated effort to restrict individual participation in the economy spans the globe but is an inherently local matter. While corporations around the world “ride it out” by hoarding their government bailout money in the bond market, regular working people are bearing the brunt of the risk and facing a brave new world on the other side of the COVID Spring, where the distance between them and the richest 0.01 percent will have grown light years further than the recommended six feet. Shocks to demand elicit certain reactions from the market, whereas shocks to the supply-side call on others. It is exceedingly rare for an economy to suffer shocks on both ends simultaneously, as is occurring at this very moment when both consumers and suppliers are in stasis. While governments slash interest rates to keep their borrowing costs low, the unprecedented flood of new money is accumulating in the hands of the wealthiest and most powerful people and corporations, who have parked all of it in bond instruments like a horse at the gate of the Kentucky Derby. As soon as the trumpet is blown and the economy restarts itself, those same trillions of dollars will come rushing out and cause massive inflation, which will only be exacerbated by low-interest rates. In other words, we’re sitting on a time bomb, and it is counting down the last seconds…."

From NY Post: Sen. Dianne Feinstein met with the Iranian foreign minister for dinner even as the Trump administration sent an aircraft carrier strike group to the region to respond to the Islamic Republic’s threats against US forces in the Middle East.

Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, met with Javad Zarif a few weeks ago when he was in the US, Politico reported on Thursday.

The California Democrat said the dinner was “arranged in consultation with the State Department.”

”The office was in touch with State in advance of the meeting to let them know it was happening and to get an update on U.S.-Iran activity,” Feinstein’s office said.

Zarif worked with former Secretary of State John Kerry on the 2015 nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration with the country and other global powers — including Russia, France, England and China.

 President Trump, who withdrew from the accord in May 2018, has accused Kerry of continuing to have conversations with Iran and said he should be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act.

Asked about Feinstein’s meeting with Zarif, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted the senator and Kerry for engaging Iran. ”These acts border — we all know the Logan Act — we all know the risks that is taken when people act as private citizens on behalf of the United States government,” Pompeo said during an interview on “Fox and Friends.”

The Logan Act, which was enacted in 1799, forbids private citizens from communicating with a foreign government having a dispute with the US. No one has ever been prosecuted under it.

The Trump administration, responding to Iranian threats against US forces in the Middle East, deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the region earlier this month.

 Pentagon officials are expected to brief members of the administration’s national security team Thursday on plans to send 10,000 troops to the Middle East to counter the threats, the Associated Press reported.

The mayor of Wuhan - the Chinese city at the center of the deadly coronavirus outbreak - has admitted to ""withholding information"" about the crisis, revealing that five million people left the city before it was placed on lockdown.

Mayor Zhou Xianwang confessed that his team held back vital information about the situation and failed to alert the public ""in time.""

Speaking during an interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Zhou also revealed that health officials are seeing human-to-human transmission of the killer virus ""on a large scale.""

Mr. Zhou disclosed that around five million Wuhan residents managed to flee the city before the area was quarantined last Thursday.

China on Tuesday reported 25 more deaths from the new viral disease, raising the total to at least 106.

Authorities have been forced to quarantine at least 56 million people living in central China's Hubei Province due to the health crisis while canceling the Lunar New Year festivities around the country.

Mayor Zhou, 56, made the worrying confession after being widely accused of covering up the truth of the epidemic.

The mayor revealed that his office needs to receive authorization from high above before making any announcements regarding the novel coronavirus.

""On one hand, we did not reveal [information] in time; on the other, we did not use effective information to improve our work to a satisfactory level,"" Mr. Zhou said during the interview.

Zhou says he hopes the public can understand his government's decision.

""Regarding the untimely disclosure, [I] hope everyone can understand,"" he said.

""[Coronavirus] is a contagious disease. Contagious diseases have relevant law and information needs to be disclosed according to law.""

He then explained the restrictions his city's government faces.

""As [the head of] a local government, after I receive the information, [I] can only release it after being authorized,"" he said.

""[Many people] could not understand this at the time.""

Mr. Zhou declared that he and the Communist Party Secretary of Wuhan are willing to resign in exchange for public forgiveness.

Increasingly drastic anti-disease efforts began with the January 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China where the virus was first detected last month.

That lockdown has expanded to a total of 17 cities with more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.

Tens of millions of people had been due to crowd into planes, trains, and buses to return to work after visiting their hometowns or tourist sites for the Lunar New Year holiday, China's busiest travel season.

Schools will postpone reopening until further notice, the Cabinet said.

The spread of the illness is being watched around the globe, with a small number of cases appearing in several other countries.

Scattered cases also have been confirmed in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada, and Australia.

The U.S. has confirmed cases in Washington state, Chicago, southern California, and Arizona.

China also reported five cases in Hong Kong and two in Macao.

Liberal filmmaker gives take on how Democrats can win 2020

Liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has championed the members of the Democratic 'Squad,' Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) as the face of the Democratic party.

Speaking on MSNBC’s “The 11th Hour,” Moore said, ""The Squad” representing the Democrats' brand is how they can win.

“Let’s hope that Alexandria and Rashida and Ilhan and Congresswoman Pressley are the faces because that’s how we’re going to win,” Moore said to host Brian Williams.

“We’re going to win with people who believe that climate change is real. We’re going to win by getting behind people who want to raise the minimum wage, who are going to fight for all these things that the American public wants. That’s ‘The Squad.’ They’re the force out there.”

The Moore offered his insights on history repeating itself to bolster that case.

“Well, first of all, Michigan has a long history, as does Wisconsin and Minnesota, the upper Midwest, of what you would call socialism or Democratic socialism or farm labor Democratic Party.""

""We’ve never trusted the banks or the large corporations. General Motors was founded in Flint, Michigan, in 1908. A year of General Motors trying to turn this into a company town, people were so upset at it, in the next election.""

""Flint elected a socialist mayor to remove the pro-G.M. mayor when the corporation first began. So that’s who we are. And the 13th district that Rashida Tlaib represents also has a strong history of — sadly right now it’s the third poorest congressional district in the country.”

“But it also has another history,” he continued.

“The congressman back in 1972 — I remember this. I was a senior in high school. Charles Diggs was his name. He’s one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. He represented Rashida Tlaib’s district in the ’70s.""

""And he wanted to go and see the situation in South Africa. And the South African government would not give him a visa, and they banned him from visiting the country. ""

""So all these years later to have our congresswoman from the 13th district in Detroit facing a similar thing, what is it that they’re afraid that they’re going to see?""

""What is it that — what doesn’t the Israeli government — I mean I watched earlier Ali Velshi had on one the refused things, one of the Israeli army veterans.""

""And he said, I was going to be her guide through Hebron, and I was going to take her down the main street of Hebron, where it’s now vacant. All the shops are gone.""

""The Israeli army calls it a sterile street. That’s what he said right on this network, a sterile street because there are no Arabs around. Our members of Congress need to see that, and that’s what unfortunately they’re not going to be able to.”

Earlier this month, Moore said that former First Lady Michelle Obama is the only person who could 'crush' President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.

Speaking on MSNBC following Wednesday night's presidential debate, Moore said the four leading Democratic candidates could still beat Trump, but lose the electoral college.

""The only way to remove Trump is to crush Trump,"" he said.

""Who is the street fighter that can crush Trump?"" he asked.

""And frankly, I think there’s a person that could do this, if the election were held today, there is one person that would crush Trump — and she hasn’t announced yet.""

""And her last name rhymes with Obama. In fact, it is Obama. Michelle Obama."""

NEW COVID-19 ACTIONS WILL INCREASE DAMAGE TO LIBERTY AND ECONOMY, PERMANENTLY

A wave of economic bad news is descending upon America as our lives and personal liberty are held hostage by further weak-kneed, follow-the-leader dictates by state governors and health officials. And for What? Essentially nothing—a manufactured, exaggerated crisis over a virus that isn’t dangerous enough to most people to justify these continuing measures. These same leaders totally refuse to act against another threat: more violent BLM protests against innocent businesses and historic statues and anyone that won’t bow down and begin to parrot the organizer’s politically correct “mea culpa” demands. Using the vehicle of an imprecise Covid 19 test, 9 states in the USA are being declared new “hot spots” and governors are using these statistics to declare new measures against a “second wave” resurgence in Covid 19. But it is all bogus. A tiny fraction of those testing positive have any sickness. How did those nine states end up on the resurgence list? They happen to be offering free testing, with a predictable result—the more you use a bogus test that picks up any kind of corona virus, the more people end up testing positive—which then justifies more restrictions. The latest statewide edict is mandatory face masks at all times when outside their home (even if they are flimsy and ineffective). But what is most discouraging is the ease at which people have bought into this grand deception. The truth is out there, but you would never know it from the uniformly positive views you get from simpletons interviewed by the mainstream media.

To date, the Bay Area has 273 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 4 deaths.

Nick Garber reports for Patch that beginning at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow (Tuesday, March 17) and lasting for three weeks until at least April 7, residents of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties in the S.F. Bay Area are ordered to “shelter in place”.

The “shelter in place” order is likely the strictest measure taken anywhere in the U.S. against COVID-19:
• None Residents are asked to stay home except for essential activities like seeking health care, shopping for food or other supplies.
• Outdoor activities like jogging and walking are allowed, but residents have to maintain a social distance of six feet, officials said.
• Businesses may remain open if they fall under a list of “essential businesses”— otherwise, they are asked to “cease all activities beyond minimum basic operations.” Many businesses would be shuttered, only allowing grocery stores, police and fire departments, pharmacies and some other businesses to stay open, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in an announcement.
• None Homeless people are not subject to the order but the state is encouraging them to seek shelter.

Tony Evers' administration in issuing the stay-at-home order and the actions of the state Department of Health Services in extending the order.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"The Wisconsin Supreme Court has overturned the state’s stay-at-home order, ruling it “unlawful” and “unenforceable” in a high-profile win for the state’s Republican-led Legislature.

In a 4-3 decision Wednesday, the court ruled that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration overstepped its authority when the state Department of Health Services extended the order to May 26.

The ruling comes after the Legislature’s Republican leaders filed a lawsuit last month arguing the order would cost Wisconsin residents their jobs and hurt many companies, asserting that if it was left in place, “our State will be in shambles.”

The suit was explicitly filed against state Department of Health Services Secretary-designee Andrea Palm and other health officials, who made the decision in mid-April to extend the state’s “Safer at Home” emergency order. At the same time as the extension, the state loosened some restrictions on specific businesses, including golf courses, public libraries, and arts and crafts stores.

In their decision Wednesday, the justices wrote:

Evers, who had ordered Palm to issue the stay-at-home order in late March, has not yet released a statement on the ruling — though he made his thoughts on the lawsuit clear when it was first filed, tweeting:

“Republicans are exploiting a global pandemic to further their attempts to undermine the will of the people. But what’s at stake goes far beyond political power–lives are on the line. This isn’t a game. This isn’t funny. People die every day because of this virus — often times painful and lonely deaths — and the more we delay or play political games the more people die.”

Still, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald claimed in a joint statement after filing their lawsuit that there’s “immense frustration regarding the extension” of the order and that Evers “has denied the people a voice through this unprecedented administrative overreach.” They said:

“Unfortunately, that leaves the legislature no choice but to ask the Supreme Court to rein in this obvious abuse of power. Wisconsinites deserve certainty, transparency, and a plan to end the constant stream of executive orders that are eroding both the economy and their liberty even as the state is clearly seeing a decline in Covid infections.”

Wisconsin Democrats, however, have argued that the health crisis “will only get worse if we end Safer at Home before it’s safe to.”

The ruling said all future lockdown orders must go through the legislature. The Safer at Home order will remain in place for six days, giving the legislature time to come up with new guidance in coordination with Evers’ office, according to the court.

As of Wednesday, Wisconsin, with a statewide population of almost 6 million, had a little over 10,902 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 421 deaths, according to the state’s Department of Health Services.

Absolutely not. Nobody took Bush Jr. and the neocons seriously when they said that the invasion of Iraq will be justified in the eyes of history, and that they will be recognized as liberators. Everybody views them as crazy radicals who should have been impeached.

For decades the tyrants behind the new world order moved in slow motion and masked their undemocratic political program behind euphemisms such as “global governance,” but they are no longer in the shadows. In fact, most of them are proud. They firmly believe they are accomplishing a task that can only be fully appreciated generations from now. That is the nature of treason. Every traitor is also a comrade, and depending on your perspective, a revolutionary.

Ten years ago it was easy for someone to deny that such a system was being put into place in America and other Western nations by stealth and without debate, but not anymore. Unless you want to purposely appear foolish and ignorant you can not deny that there is a scripted plan for a dictatorial world government. Even CNN is using the term “new world order” in its coverage of the Libyan war. It doesn’t make sense to say that the new world order is emerging anymore, because it is already here.

There are probably many reasons why President Barack Obama didn’t bother to seek the approval of Congress before committing the U.S. military to an undefined mission in Libya, some of them may even be legitimate and reasonable, but none are more important and more alarming than the fact that the Congress is obsolete under the new world order system.

How long will the America people, and the peoples of other Western nations tolerate the tyrannical new world order system is a question that cannot be answered at this moment. We are still in the early stages of an evolving global political crisis that will rock America above all other nations.

Sooner or later, President Obama is going to have to make a speech justifying the new world order system, and the destruction of the U.S. constitution. The unmasking will be painful for a lot of people, and most likely cause popular uproar, but it has to be done because the President and the governments of the West can no longer politically hide the fact that Congress and Parliament are obsolete national institutions. The Libya case illustrates this fact. Internationalism is the new norm, at least for now. And it looks like many people are fine with global dictatorship, especially self-described democrats and liberals.

Of course, Obama can continue to lie about his administration’s hidden agenda, but people are believing him less and less. A salesman can only lie and get away with it for so long. His presidency can be saved if his handlers have the guts to stage another terrorist attack in America and blame it on foreign agents, but even that course of action may not rescue Obama’s dropping poll numbers because false-flag terrorism has been exposed and it is seen for what it is: government deception and state terrorism.

Ultimately, the tyrants who want to impose a dictatorial world government will fail, just like Hitler did, as well as every other criminal conqueror in the past who desired to rule the known world. Despite being socially conditioned and brainwashed, the people of America and the West are not going quietly into the good night. And a few good men in the Congress and Senate are not either. Millions of people still believe in the U.S. constitution and don’t regard it as a “piece of paper” like Bush and Obama do.

Last week, Senator Jim Webb criticized President Obama for bypassing Congress on Libya, saying:

“[A] concern that I have is that we have been sort of on autopilot for almost 10 years from now in terms of presidential authority in conducting these type of military operations absent the meaningful participation of the Congress,” Webb said. “We have not had a debate and I know that there was some justification put into place because of concern for civilian casualties. But this isn’t the way that our system is supposed to work.” (Courtesy of The Daily Caller)

Congressman Ron Paul voiced the same concern in this video about the war in Libya.

It is inevitable that a coalition of patriots across nations will rise and oppose the new world order system on grounds that it is tyrannical and illegitimate. And they will probably succeed in the end because it is the most difficult thing in the world to establish and preserve authority which is seen as illegal and untrustworthy by the people.

Also, it does not help the globalist cause that the new world order system was planned in secrecy by a collection of the most corrupt, dishonorable, and murderous criminals around. Add the fact that its existence was guarded by the media for decades, and what you have is a political crisis of the highest order.

Did you know that the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) group is a communist group full of members that are working hard to dismantle the U.S. government and thwart policies and legislation of the current duly-elected administration? If you don’t know, that may be because the executives at Google also support communism and are blocking millions of Americans from watching videos that expose deep state operatives that are clearly traitors to America, just like the Big Tech executives themselves.

About half way into certain Project Veritas videos, Google Chrome abruptly interrupts the video and projects a “Critical Error” message enveloping your smart device screen. Coincidence? We think not. The only critical error being made is by the deep state communists working for the DSA anarchists.

So, unless you’re living in a basement somewhere and off the grid, you know by now that all of social media, including YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest are outright banning (or at least shadow-banning) and defunding all Republican and Conservative voices, videos, businesses, websites, blogs, and whistle-blowers that connect with thousands (or millions) of subscribers and followers daily. Just check into the complete social media black-out happening now for Alex Jones and InfoWars, if you’re having any doubts.

Bill Gates, Marc Zuckerberg, George Soros, and Jeff Bezos have one main goal – destroy the U.S. Republic and install a communist/socialist “New World Order”

A “Deep State” coup is underway in America and it’s no conspiracy theory. Captured on video time and time again by the Constitution-defending Veritas Project, U.S. federal employees, some even high-ranking, are being uncovered inside the IRS, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Health & Human Services (HHS), and yes, the Department of Justice (DOJ). If you’re wondering why people would risk their jobs and even jail time for committing acts of treason while working for the U.S. Government, you can stop wondering now.

The mass media has brainwashed millions of Americans, including top Government officials, into believing that our country is run by a white supremacist freak, when actually it’s the “Resistance” movement that wants genocide, depopulation, communism, and to destroy the entire U.S. middle class. Little do they all realize.

Also, many deep state insiders, including those who “work” for the Democratic Socialists of America are funded by the deep pockets of billionaire and Nazi-sympathizer George Soros. Yet, Soros isn’t alone at the helm. The insidious Bill Gates, Marc Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos also have one main goal – destroy the U.S. Republic and install a communist/socialist new “New World Order.” These are all mega-rich “white dudes” who are in control of not only all social media, Google, YouTube and Twitter, but also major media outlets CNN, Washington Post (the WashPo rag) and the failing New York Times.

Is it impossible to fire Federal employees? That’s what the deep state LEFTISTS working for the U.S. Government think – and that’s why they break the law regularly

If you commit crimes and “don’t give a sh#t” about the consequences, you’re the worst type of criminal alive. In fact, that sounds like the words of a terrorist. Currently, that’s the actions and words of IRS officials who also work for hours on end for the Democratic Socialists of America (a.k.a. Democrats Serving Anarchists) while on the clock at their high-paid U.S. government jobs. All of this targeting of conservatives has been going on since at least 2013, when Project Veritas first starting revealing, on video, top executives at Planned Parenthood, negotiating cash prices for abortion body parts illegally sold on the black market. Planned Parenthood itself is nothing more than a population control machine that brainwashed Democrats believe helps their own people celebrate “health freedom.”

Now, U.S. government officials are not only breaking the law, but bragging about it with complete arrogance. This U.S. GAO auditor, Natarajan Subramanian, is pushing a communist (they also call it socialist, but it’s the same thing) agenda all day while at work, and this is his quote from the video, “No one knows I spent six hours yesterday doing social media for DSA.”

He also admits that he wants to destroy American values and businesses as he states, “…it’s a socialist organization and we want to destroy capitalists.”

He goes on to state that, “We have a bunch of just like communists, like no prefix, and that’s basically me.” … “Do I care more about having this job, or do I care more about the [DSA] movement, and I was like… obviously the movement.”

Project Veritas also discovered this same American traitor and communist manages social media and communications for Metro DC DSA. Later on in the video he further implicates himself, saying, “Sometimes as a government employee, you have to keep it under wraps a little bit so you don’t get into trouble and that’s kind of what I try to do.” …

“That’s when I might get fired. If there’s like a camera above my cubicle looking down so they can see and zoom in and see what’s on my phone.”

All of these outright anarchist freaks think they can’t be fired because they are U.S. federal employees. Is that true? They’re about to find out. Tune into Trump.news for updates on the 2018 mid-term elections and other ways the Deep State will try their best to dismantle our Republic.

It implies that there is secrecy surrounding the true effects of vaccines.,"6-in-1 vaccine KILLS 36 infants, reveals “confidential” document – do we need more proof that vaccines are harmful?

If all vaccines were truly “safe and effective” as establishment health authorities and government goons routinely claim, then 36 infants wouldn’t have died from a 6-in-1 vaccine known as “Infanrix Hexa,” developed by pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), over a two-year period.

Confidential documents recently unearthed and made public by the website “Initiative Citoyenne” show that there were at least 1,742 adverse reactions, 503 of which were classified as “serious,” as well as the aforementioned 36 deaths, that occurred between October 23, 2009, and October 22, 2011 – but that were never reported by GSK.

The eye-opening information contained in this 1,271-page document reveals that at least 1.5 deaths per month occurred in association with Infanrix Hexa – and these were just the deaths that were reported. Seeing as how only 1-10 percent of vaccine adverse reactions even end up in the official statistics, the number of deaths could be far higher.

According to that data that is publicly available, most of the babies who were reported to have died from Infanrix Hexa passed away within the first few days following vaccination. Three of the infants reportedly died within hours of receiving the vaccine.

“It’s not that 14 deaths were recorded by GSK between October 2009 and end in October 2011 as we had originally calculated but 36 (14 from 2010 to 2011 and 22 from 2009 to 2010),” Initiative Citoyenne reported.

“In addition to these 36 deaths [there were] at least 37 other deaths (sudden death mainly), bringing the total to at least 73 deaths since the launch of the vaccine in 2000, and again, this concerns only the death by sudden death, no further recovery of under-reporting.”

For more vaccine-related news, be sure to check out Vaccines.news.

This roughly 24-month snapshot of injuries and deaths caused by Infanrix Hexa is supplemented by research that came out several years later linking the vaccine to permanent autism and brain damage.

As we reported at the time, Italian authorities ruled that this multivalent vaccine, which contains deadly chemicals like thimerosal (mercury), aluminum, formaldehyde (rat poison), genetically-modified viral components, and a slew of chemical preservatives, was responsible for causing a young boy to develop autism after receiving the three recommended doses of the jab.

Italy’s Ministry of Health at first rejected a petition put forth by the boy’s parents, prompting them to file a lawsuit – unlike in the United States, vaccine corporations are held liable for injuries and deaths caused by their products in Italy.

These parents ultimately won their case, setting a precedent at least in Europe that vaccines can, and do, cause autism, and that they aren’t 100 percent safe and effective as Big Vaccine is notorious for claiming.

Italy also ruled that MMR causes autism, despite industry claims to the contrary

Several years prior to this ruling, which was challenged by Italy’s Ministry of Health, an Italian judge by the name of Lucio Ardigo made a similar ruling with regards to the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella.

A boy who was vaccinated with MMR was “damaged by irreversible complications due to vaccination (with trivalent MMR),” read the official court documents associated with the case.

In other words, MMR does cause autism, and parents who wish to protect their children from potentially incurring permanent, lifelong brain damage would do best to avoid it entirely – along with all other vaccines, none of which have ever been scientifically proven to be either safe or effective.

“Considering this information, is it any wonder that babies are dying after receiving vaccinations containing these ingredients?” comments vaccine expert Christina England, writing for GreenMedInfo.

“GlaxoSmithKline may try and hide the facts from us but they cannot hide them forever. Infanrix Hexa should be removed from the market immediately.”"

In the early days they simply crucified certain rebellious citizens, whilst sprinkling in the occasional peasant massacre to ensure a climate of fear and to thwart any challenge to their hegemony.

When this overtly bloody strategy provoked revolution in such disparate locales as France, America and Russia; and later Cuba, the Congo and Vietnam, the bloodline oligarchs shifted to a strategy of covert assassination and counter-revolutionary intrigues. But brutality is brutality, however subtle and disguised.

So when this strategy failed to stem the tide of history, while provoking a democratic and thus subversive reaction amongst the populace, the international banking syndicate and its coterie of idle rich turned to psychological warfare.

They learned that it is much easier to control a population through brainwashing than it is to mow down a more cognizant citizenry in the streets and risk backlash. The key, they learned, was to keep people docile, fearful and ignorant.

In 1913 the Rockefeller Foundation came into being. It would shield the family’s wealth from the coming income tax provisions of the never-ratified 16th Amendment of 1913.

More importantly, it would allow the owners of the Federal Reserve – created that same year – to steer public opinion through social engineering via grant money. One of its most infamous tentacles was the General Education Board.

“In our dreams we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands. The present education conventions fade from their minds and, unhampered by tradition, we will work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall try not to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or men of science… of whom we have ample supply.”

Over the next decades the condescending financial parasites at Club Fed would fabricate all matter of story lines to keep “the rural folk” frightened and inert.

These included the Great Depression, the Cold War, McCarthyism and nuclear Armageddon. All of these were booms for the international banking syndicate and their defense/oil/drug mafia kin.

Current “scary story lines” include Muslim extremism and global warming. The former is funded by Britain’s M-15 and the Israeli Mossad and has, two wars later, proven to be a Wall Street goldmine.

The latter, while difficult to refute in fact, is being used to further enrich the casino owners. Goldman Sachs will, for example, be the biggest beneficiary if cap and trade is initiated.

Should we arrest and prosecute Muslim extremists, like that blond-haired, green-eyed white woman in Pennsylvania? Certainly. Should we stop pumping CO2 into our atmosphere, even if we aren’t facing catastrophe? Of course. But these things should not make us scared.

Yet that is exactly what the establishment media wants to do. Fox News right-wing viewers are brainwashed to fear “the Muslims”. CNN liberal-wing watchers are hypnotized to fear global warming. Both “scary story lines” have been utilized to both enrich the global elite and restrict our civil liberties.

In case you haven’t noticed, so much of what Natural News has predicted over the years is not only now coming true, but is also now being reported by the mainstream media. This proves, once again, that many of the so-called “conspiracy theories” that the independent media is often accused of spreading are actually just cutting-edge truth bombs being dropped long before the establishment chooses to take notice of them.

Take the “smart” revolution, for instance. For years, Natural News has been warning that so-called “smart” devices are really just spy devices that spook entities like the National Security Agency (NSA) are using to violate the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans – and we’ve taken plenty of flack for suggesting such. But it’s since been shown that “smart” televisions, for instance, are, in fact, watching and listening to people as they stare into these giant screens.

The same is true for all of the “smartphones” that people stare into all day long, which we warned last fall are being used by tech giants like Facebook to not only listen in on people’s private conversations without their knowledge or consent, but also track their every move – again, without permission.

It wasn’t too long ago that using words like “globalists” or “deep state” to describe the backroom entities that control our planet was considered to be a “mental illness.” But now, once again, such terms have gone mainstream because, contrary to what the establishment would have us all believe, there really is a shadow government working behind the scenes to destroy America from within, and strip its people of all the rights and liberties that were bravely fought for by our Founding Fathers.

Or how about the corruption of the Democratic Party, which tried to steal the 2016 election in favor of Hillary Clinton? This one is still being denied by the establishment as a “conspiracy theory,” even though copious evidence continues to surface, showing that the Clintons, the Obamas, and many other deep state groups had plotted a treasonous coup to prevent Donald Trump from gaining access to the Oval Office.

“Deep state traitors such as Robert Mueller and Barack Obama can arguably be designated enemy combatants by the President,” Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, wrote last fall in response to the many information “dumps” that implicated many prominent Democrats and Republicans for colluding to overthrow a lawfully-elected president. “There is more than enough evidence to be declassified that clearly supports this designation,” he added.

For more news about how the independent media is almost always first when it comes to telling the truth, be sure to check out Truth.news.

The mainstream media is generally DEAD LAST in telling controversial truths, if they ever even report on them at all

Another topic long denied by the establishment that’s since gone mainstream is the rampant problem of child trafficking and pedophilia within the upper echelons of power, both in the United States and around the world. Jeffrey Epstein, who’s perhaps the most prominent example of this, was recently reported dead from suicide after he was arrested on charges relating to his infamous “Pedo Island.”

But remember just a few years back when all the talk about “Pizzagate” was dubbed a “wild conspiracy theory” by the establishment press? As it turns out, the independent media was on the right track with this one as well, and the mainstream media is only just now catching up with the fact that those occupying the highest levels of government and business are often just a bunch of child-molesting perverts.

And let’s not forget Big Tech, which thanks to the brave work of Project Veritas and others is now being exposed for skewing the news; meddling in elections; and targeting conservatives, among other crimes. This, too, was dubbed a “conspiracy theory” only just a few years ago, though it’s now undeniable that it was actually a conspiracy fact.

These and many other bombshell truths were first brought to light by the independent media, it’s important to note, which sustained an endless barrage of attacks simply for suggesting it. But eventually, like with so many other “controversial” topics and issues, the mainstream media picked it up and suddenly it became regular news, now that they’re the ones saying it.

We’re starting to see the same thing happen with topics like “global warming” and “climate change,” as well. Those who rejected the official narrative that the earth is warming due to fossil fuel use have long been dubbed “climate deniers,” though it’s now coming to light, just like we long warned, that the alleged “science” behind the official climate narrative is flawed, at best.

“Climate change scientists know full well that the dishonest media will gladly report fake science as factual and true as long as it promotes their climate change disinformation agenda,” warns Adams about how it all works. “They don’t care if the facts check out.”

“All they care about is whether President Trump can somehow be blamed (and Al Gore can be celebrated as a god, even though he knows nothing about real atmospheric science) … Scientific facts are of zero interest to the media, which is almost entirely run by ‘journalists’ who are scientifically illiterate and wouldn’t know what a ‘least squares linear trend’ is if their life depended on it.”

However, shingles, which is a painful recurrence of chickenpox, mostly in adults, has become an epidemic that is directly related to the vaccine. Shingles is far more serious and life-threatening than chicken pox. The bottom line is that billions of dollars are spent on vaccinating children to reduce the rate of a relatively mild childhood disease only to make them more susceptible to the same virus as adults causing serious illness (more medical bills) and even death. Big Pharma wins at both ends of the cycle. –GEG

When I was a child, nearly everybody became ill with chickenpox. Like nearly all kids, when I became ill with it, I stayed home from school about a week and fully recovered.

All that changed in 1995, when the FDA licensed and approved the live attenuated chickenpox (varicella) vaccine in persons aged >12 months. After the vaccine began to be used by most children, the incidence of chickenpox rapidly declined. However, due to continual outbreaks of chickenpox, a second dose of the chickenpox vaccine was added to the childhood immunization schedule in 2006.

Is the chickenpox vaccine effective at significantly lowering the incidence of chickenpox? Yes. Due to the vaccine, there is a significantly lowered incidence of chickenpox.

However, the most important question to ask is, “Has the chickenpox vaccine (along with the other 70 doses of vaccines given) improved the lives of our children and the rest of the population? The answer to that question is easy: No.

Yes, our children have less chickenpox due to the vaccine. However, shingles, a painful reoccurrence of chickenpox, has become an epidemic illness affecting both children and adults. The rapidly increased incidence of shingles is directly related to the use of the chickenpox vaccine. You see, we need chickenpox circulating in the environment to tweak our immune systems in order to stay alert. With the effectiveness of the chickenpox vaccine, our immune systems are no longer stimulated with the varicella virus (the virus that causes both chickenpox and shingles) which allows the reactivation of the chickenpox virus—shingles– to develop. Studies have shown that we spend more money treating shingles than the savings due to the lowered rate of chickenpox. And, shingles can develop into a chronic, debilitating disease and can cause death.

I keep hearing the mantra that vaccines are safe and effective. That is simply not true. Vaccines are associated with a host of adverse effects. In the case of the chickenpox vaccine, a recent study looked at the adverse effects of this therapy.

The study concluded, “We identified no new or unexpected safety concerns for the second-dose varicella vaccine.” (1)

However, when the entire study is read, a different picture is formed. The authors found 14,641 reports (from 2006-2014) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) after the second dose of the chickenpox vaccine. VAERS is a voluntary reporting system designed to collect information about adverse effects from vaccinations. It is estimated that only 1-10% of all vaccine-related adverse effects are reported to VAERS since it is a voluntary system. (2) Since it is a voluntary system, there is no doubt that VAERS underestimates the adverse effects due to vaccines. I would venture a guess that most doctors who administer vaccines are unaware of VAERS. I know that is true from quizzing many doctors about whether they are aware of VAERS.

According to the study, 3% of the adverse reactions were classified as serious. Serious adverse reactions included anaphylaxis (83), meningitis (5), encephalitis—inflammation of the brain (16), cellulitis (52), chickenpox (6), shingles (6), and death (7)."

A computer model developed back in 1973 by a group of MIT scientists is warning that the human quality of life is about to dramatically drop before civilization comes to an abrupt end by the year 2040.

The computer predicts that humanity's standards of living will begin declining from the year 2020 before we witness the ""end of civilization"" by 2040.

Experts have warned humanity is heading for severe shortages of water, food, and oil as our limited natural resources begin to decline.

According to ZeroHedge: The prediction came from a programme nicknamed World One, which was developed by a team of MIT researchers and processed by Australia’s largest computer.

It was originally devised by computer pioneer Jay Forrester, after he was tasked by the Club of Rome to develop a model of global sustainability.

However, the shocking result of the computer calculations showed that the level of pollution and population would cause a global collapse by 2040.

The fact that the Club of Rome was behind Jay Forrester’s work is a major red flag, because David Rockefeller and other globalists founded the Club of Rome and it has always been used to further the globalist agenda.

Could it be possible that this computer model is a glimpse into the kind of future that the globalists believe is coming?

According to the model, life as we know it is about to change in a massive way…

At this time the broadcasters addreses the audience: “At around 2020, the condition of the planet becomes highly critical.

“If we do nothing about it, the quality of life goes down to zero. Pollution becomes so seriously it will start to kill people, which in turn will cause the population to diminish, lower than it was in the 1900.

“At this stage, around 2040 to 2050, civilised life as we know it on this planet will cease to exist.”

The computer model appears to be primarily concerned with natural resources, pollution and population levels, but other factors should be considered as well.

In order to have “civilization”, people need to behave in a civilized manner, and we see more evidence that we are in an advanced state of social decay on a daily basis.

For example, one would think that priests would be some of the most well-behaved and “civilized” members of our society, but a new report about clergy child abuse in Pennsylvania is pulling back the curtain on incredible acts of darkness…

Horrific details have emerged about predatory behavior by priests, including those who made young boys rinse their mouths with holy water to ‘purify’ them after they were forced to give oral sex and one young boy made to pose naked as Jesus while other priests took pornographic pictures and shared them with other clergymen.

A bombshell report by a grand jury in Pennsylvania has extensively detailed for the first time how 300 priests sexually abused more than 1,000 children and how church leaders, some of whom are still alive, covered it up.

Remember, these 300 priests are just from one state.

There are countless other incidents of abuse all over the country, and it is a crisis that appears to be escalating.

Earlier today, I came across a story about a 22-year-old man in Michigan that approached a group of young girls in a forceful manner, but fortunately they were able to fight him off…

Four Michigan girls successfully fought off a man who allegedly intended to kidnap and have sex with one of them by punching him and flinging hot coffee in his face.

Bruce Hipkins, 22, of Tuscola County, Michigan, was charged with kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, assault and battery and criminal sexual conduct charges following the incident which occurred Friday night.

The thin veneer of civilization that we all take for granted on a daily basis is wearing very thin, and it is all that really separates us from societal collapse, chaos and anarchy.

Ultimately, a computer model from 1973 is probably not going to be the best guide, but I do agree that enormous societal changes are heading our way very rapidly.

In fact, I wrote an entire novel about what America will start to look like as those societal changes begin to accelerate.

I am more convinced than ever that America is heading for a “perfect storm” that will bring us to our knees, but most Americans appear to have bought into the fiction that everything is going to be okay somehow even though it is exceedingly clear that virtually nothing about our society is sustainable over an extended period of time.

A day of reckoning is inevitably coming, and even a computer model from 1973 can see that.

For those of you that have stopped, it is time to start prepping again. A major international debt crisis has started, war almost erupted in the Middle East last week, and civil unrest is starting to erupt in major cities all across America.

I believe that we are going to witness bigger cha

nges over the next two years than we have over the last ten years combined. The clock is ticking, and America’s date with destiny is fast approaching.

As always, let us hope for the best, but let us also get prepared for the worst."

Authorities in the Veneto region said the event would end later on Sunday, two days earlier than scheduled.

Italy has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe, with 152. Three people have died.

Italy has imposed strict quarantine restrictions in two northern “hotspot” regions close to Milan and Venice.

About 50,000 people cannot enter or leave several towns in Veneto and Lombardy for the next two weeks without special permission. Even outside the zone, many businesses and schools have suspended activities, and sporting events have been cancelled including several top-flight football matches.

The BBC’s Mark Lowen described the situation just outside the zone.

In neighbouring Austria, a train from Venice was stopped at the Austrian border after it emerged that two passengers had fever symptoms. Austria’s Interior Minister Karl Nehammer later confirmed to the BBC that the pair tested negative for coronavirus.

“All authorities have acted quickly and with great caution in this case,” said Mr Nehammer in a statement. “The reporting chain worked without delay.”

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Saturday that “extraordinary measures” would come into force to try to stem the rising number of coronavirus cases.

He said the quarantine restrictions could last for weeks.

Police, and if necessary the armed forces, will have the authority to ensure the regulations are enforced.

Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy’s Civil Protection Department, told reporters that 110 of the confirmed cases were in Lombardy, with 21 in Veneto with others in Emilia-Romagna and Lazio.

Officials reported a third death on Sunday, an elderly woman from the town of Crema suffering from cancer.

Italian officials say they are still trying to trace the source of the outbreak.

The Venice Carnival had been due to close on Tuesday but regional president Luca Zaia told Sky TG24 television on Sunday that it would be suspended, along with other events, in a bid to combat the virus.

“From this evening, we plan to stop carnival and all sporting activities until 1 March,” he said.

Universities in Milan have been closed and the city’s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said schools would also close their doors while the outbreak continued.

“As a precaution I think that the schools have to be closed in Milan. I will propose to the president of the region to enlarge the precaution to the entire metropolitan city area. It is just a precaution, we don’t want to create panic,” he said."

Those 28 pages are “an entire section within the official report of the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks… Conducted by the House and Senate intelligence committees, its 838-page report was published in December 2002.”

Over the past several weeks, discussion has reignited debate over the need to release the redacted section for several reasons — the most striking being a bill to allow the families of 9/11 victims sue Saudi Arabia over its potential involvement in the attacks.

In what cannot be considered a coincidence, also on Tuesday, the Senate voted to approve that exact legislation — called Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) — in direct defiance of vows from Pres. Obama that he will summarily veto the bill should it land on his desk.

Separate legislation, which coincides with JASTA — S.B. 1471, Transparency for the Families of 9/11 Victims and Survivors Act of 2015 — would require the president to declassify those currently-redacted pages.

This would almost certainly be imperative for JASTA to have the teeth necessary for affected families to pursue justice.

Tuesday’s disclosure from the National Archives appears to show why those families might, indeed, have a justifiable reason to hold the Saudis at least partly responsible for damages — despite its contents only hinting at information potentially contained in the 28 pages.

Former member of the 9/11 Commission, John Lehman, came forward in the past week calling for a new and thorough investigation into Saudi involvement in the attacks.

In measured and precise language, Lehman noted that:

Perhaps, as Lehman suggested, the institution of the Saudi government did not play a role; however, as found in the document in the Times, at least a partial connection already stands.

A shady cast of characters are briefly outlined in the document under the heading, “A Brief Overview of Possible Saudi Government Connections to the September 11th attacks” — and simply in context it appears a number of notable associations may have been made.

Omar Al-Bayoumi, a Saudi national, encouraged two of the hijackers to move to the San Diego area where he was located. As the document describes:

“Al-Bayoumi has extensive ties to the Saudi Government and many in the local Muslim community in San Diego believed that he was a Saudi intelligence officer. The FBI believes it is possible that he was an agent of the Saudi government and that he may have been reporting on the local community to Saudi Government officials.” Osama Bassnan “received considerable funding from Prince Bandar and Princess Haifa, supposedly for his wife’s medical treatments. According to FBI documents, Bassnan is a former employee of the Saudi Government’s Educational Mission in Washington, D.C.”

Though some officials privy to the redacted section have claimed any connection to kingdom officials is tenuous, at best, one solid link already stands.

Fahad al-Thumairy, a former diplomat at the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles, associated himself with al-Bayoumi in San Diego before the revocation of his visa and his subsequent return to Saudi Arabia in May 2003.

In fact, the document lists a pilot for the Saudi royal family who ferried Osama bin Laden back and forth between Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia during his “exile.”

A number of others are listed with less than questionable ties to either the Saudi government, the royal family, or both.

But perhaps most telling are the questions the document appears to be proposing for the investigation — or, more specifically, what seems to be implied in those questions.

On their own, such questions seem basic, obvious, and even mundane as so essential to the investigation to be needless to state — but taken with the details of this outline and the context of what their answers may constitute in those redacted 28 pages, the repercussions become apparent.

If, for instance, the U.S. decided not to thoroughly pursue avenues of investigation due to economic interests in Saudi affairs, that would show fealty to another country over the best interests of the victims of those attacks.

Perhaps that murky obstruction is best seen in the document’s discussion of an FBI informant located in San Diego. Buried among other questions, the document asks:

With the firestorm swirling once again around the redacted 28 pages, this basic outline of a document offers a serious glimpse into what might prove to be a fundamental shift in the narrative of 9/11 the U.S. government has spoonfed for over a decade.

As U.S.-Saudi relations have recently deteriorated to an arguable new low, perhaps it remains just a matter of time before we all know the truth."
497,True,The article discusses a conspiracy theory about the CDC removing a page from their website about the contamination of polio vaccines with a cancer-causing virus.,True,The article mentions the CDC as the actor responsible for removing the page from their website.,True,The article mentions the CDC removing a page from their website and the contamination of polio vaccines with a cancer-causing virus as the actions.,True,"The article mentions that millions of Americans could have received a contaminated dose of the polio vaccine, which could lead to cancer.",True,The article connects the contamination of polio vaccines with the rise in cancer cases and mentions the discovery of the virus in various tumors.,True,The article suggests that the CDC removed the page from their website to hide the information about the contamination of polio vaccines.,"The CDC has quickly removed a page from their website, which is now cached here, admitting that more than 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine within an 8-year span when a proportion of the vaccine was contaminated with a cancer causing polyomavirus called SV40. It has been estimated that 10-30 million Americans could have received an SV40 contaminated dose of the vaccine.

V40 is an abbreviation for Simian vacuolating virus 40 or Simian virus 40, a polyomavirus that is found in both monkeys and humans. Like other polyomaviruses, SV40 is a DNA virus that has been found to cause tumors and cancer.

SV40 is believed to suppress the transcriptional properties of the tumor-suppressing genes in humans through the SV40 Large T-antigen and SV40 Small T-antigen. Mutated genes may contribute to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, leading to cancer.

 

 Michele Carbone, Assistant Professor of Pathology at Loyola University in Chicago, has recently isolated fragments of the SV-40 virus in human bone cancers and in a lethal form of lung cancer called mesothelioma. He found SV-40 in 33% of the osteosarcoma bone cancers studied, in 40% of other bone cancers, and in 60% of the mesotheliomas lung cancers, writes Geraldo Fuentes.

Dr. Michele Carbone openly acknowledged HIV/AIDS was spread by the hepatitis B vaccine produced by Merck & Co. during the early 1970s. It was the first time since the initial transmissions took place in 1972-74, that a leading expert in the field of vaccine manufacturing and testing has openly admitted the Merck & Co. liability for AIDS. 

 

 The matter-of-fact disclosure came during discussions of polio vaccines contaminated with SV40 virus which caused cancer in nearly every species infected by injection. Many authorities now admit much, possibly most, of the world’s cancers came from the Salk and Sabin polio vaccines, and hepatitis B vaccines, produced in monkeys and chimps.

It is said mesothelioma is a result of asbestos exposure, but research reveals that 50% of the current mesotheliomas being treated no longer occurs due to asbestos but rather the SV-40 virus contained in the polio vaccination. In addition, according to researchers from the Institute of Histology and General Embryology of the University of Ferrara, SV-40 has turned up in a variety other tumors. By the end of 1996, dozens of scientists reported finding SV40 in a variety of bone cancers and a wide range of brain cancers, which had risen 30 percent over the previous 20 years."
498,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and federal officials as actors responsible for sending tainted test kits.,True,"The article mentions that the CDC sent states tainted test kits, which led to contamination and uninterpretable results.",True,"The article states that the contamination of the test kits caused a delay in testing, which lost the country invaluable time to contain the pandemic.",False,The article does not mention any patterns or connections made by the author.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"As the new coronavirus took root across America, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent states tainted test kits in early February that were themselves seeded with the virus, federal officials have confirmed.

The contamination made the tests uninterpretable, and—because testing is crucial for containment efforts—it lost the country invaluable time to get ahead of the advancing pandemic.

The CDC had been vague about what went wrong with the tests, initially only saying that “a problem in the manufacturing of one of the reagents” had led to the failure. Subsequent reporting suggested that the problem was with a negative control—that is, a part of the test meant to be free of any trace of the coronavirus as a critical reference for confirming that the test was working properly overall.

Now, according to investigation results reported by The New York Times, federal officials confirm that sloppy laboratory practices at two of three CDC labs involved in the tests’ creation led to contamination of the tests and their uninterpretable results.

Shortly after the problems became apparent in early February, the Food and Drug Administration sent Timothy Stenzel, chief of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health, to the CDC to investigate what was going wrong. According to the Times, he found a lack of coordination and inexperience in commercial manufacturing.

Problems that led to the contamination included researchers coming and going from labs working on the test kits without changing their coats and researchers sharing lab space to both assemble test components and handle samples containing the coronavirus.

The CDC said in a statement Saturday to the Times that the agency “did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol.” Though the CDC appeared reluctant to admit contamination was at the root of the problem, the Times noted that in a separate statement the CDC seemed to acknowledge such problems, saying the agency has since “implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing the issue moving forward.”

After the CDC first sent its test kit to states in early February, it took the agency around a month to fix the problem. By then, the virus had invaded many communities unimpeded, and any chance that the US had at containing its spread had virtually vanished. By mid-March, many states turned to mitigation efforts, such as social distancing, to try to blunt—rather than prevent—the life-threatening, healthcare-overwhelming effects of COVID-19.

“It was just tragic,” Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told the Times. “All that time when we were sitting there waiting, I really felt like, here we were at one of the most critical junctures in public health history, and the biggest tool in our toolbox was missing.”

As of the morning of April 20, the US has confirmed more than 760,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 40,700 deaths. The numbers are expected to be underestimates due to the slow and still limited amount of testing."

“The President of the United States is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven.”

Thus spake Pat Robertson during the recent brouhaha over Syria, where the unthinkable notion that the US might actually pull out of a war zone instead of sending more troops in began to materialize last week.

Now, you might be tempted to dismiss this as just another raving of Pat “God blessed the Gulf War” Robertson, and you wouldn’t be wrong. But still, that’s quite the phrase: The “mandate of heaven.” What does it mean?

Well, it turns out he didn’t just make that up himself.

The “Mandate of Heaven” is an argument for the legitimacy of government that arose in ancient China. Called “天命” (Tianming) in Chinese, the concept rests on four basic principles:
• Heaven grants the emperor the right to rule;
• As there is only one Heaven, so there can be only one emperor at a time;
• The emperor’s right to rule is dependent upon his virtue; and
• The right to rule is not granted to any particular family line in perpetuity.

Now you might wonder what China’s “mandate of heaven” has to do with America’s presidential system, so let me assure you that they’re closely connected. In fact, the tie-in is so obvious that we never think to mention it except in times of extreme crisis. It takes the form of a question: Where the legitimacy of the government—and our would-be “rulers”—come from in the first place, if not straight from heaven?

Why does this or that person have the right to pass this or that law? What process imparts power to this or that lawmaker? How do governments themselves come about, and what gives them the “right” to rule over a given patch of ground (and, almost as an afterthought, over the serfs living on that patch of ground)? Why does the state exist at all?

If you’re concerned about whether or not you’re properly tithing to the god known as government, you won’t want to miss this edition of The Corbett Report Subscriber. And stick around for this week’s recommended reading, viewing and listening.

NSA officials asked Qwest to participate in a warrantless wiretapping program that the telecom’s lawyers believed was illegal in February 2001, six months before Sept. 11, court transcripts reveal. The court transcripts were the basis of a Denver Post article published on Oct. 21, 2007.

The transcripts were of Nacchio’s trial for insider trading, which ended up revealing a lot more. At the trial, Nacchio maintained that the federal government punished his company for not participating in the surveillance program by not rewarding it secret federal contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And we now know, as we have reported previously, that federal agencies are now amassing databases that rival even the NSA’s.

Qwest later went bankrupt, and Nacchio was convicted of insider trading for his dealings in its stock and sentenced to four years in federal prison. Nacchio was released from prison earlier this year and is currently in house arrest.

The transcripts indicate that Qwest worked closely with the NSA and was pressured to participate in a program called Pioneer Groundbreaker, which was designed to create a data center that would allow the NSA to tap into phone calls, fax machines, and internet activities.

The participants discussed a kidnapping operation of the Russian servicemen in southern Syria.

US military advisers have ordered Syrian radicals of so-called ‘moderate’ opposition to capture Russian servicemen or military police personnel operating in Quneytra and Daraa provinces.

The US representatives pledged to provide modern arms, communication facilities, and information about Russian military personnel movements and their routes for the militants. Besides, terrorists intend to capture Russians wearing other jihadist groups’ uniform such as ISIS or Hay’at Tahrir al Sham.

This region was not chosen for carrying out provocation randomly. The situation in the southern provinces of Syria has extremely sharpened recently. Lately, the Syrian Arab Army units were forced to conduct an operation against the militants’ ‘sleeping cells’ in al Sanamaine in response to disturbances organized by the radicals.

It’s worth noting that US intelligence has a significant influence on the situation on the Jordan-Syria border. US-backed militants have special training courses at the US bases in Jordan. The US intelligence and its agents are engaged in vigorous activity in southern Syria, provoking an escalation of violence and not allowing Damascus to establish a peaceful life in Daraa and Quneytra provinces.

Moreover, nine years ago anti-government protests began in Daraa province, that rapidly turned into a radical armed uprising under the banner of extremist organizations. It was a stronghold of the so-called ‘moderate’ opposition until 2018, when government forces supported by Russia, took control over it, disarmed the militants for their further integration into civilian life.

Obviously such kind of provocations leads to the escalation of violence and final defamation of any opposition forces in Syria. The terrorist operations organized by the US reaffirms Washington’s unwillingness in peaceful life restoration in Syria and readiness of the White House to commit any crimes to achieve its goals."

In this December 8th story by Mike Adams at Natural News titled “Democrats are ‘summoning the DEMON of political violence,’ and the next phase of their criminal coup will unleash blood in the streets”, his story confirms what we’ve long reported on ANP: essentially, if Democrats can’t ‘control’ society, they’ll destroy it.

Perfectly illustrated in their ‘bloodlust, media-hyped hatred’ of anything Christian, Conservative, pro-America or pro-President Trump that has led to innocent people, often the elderly, being brutally attacked in the streets for simply wearing a MAGA hat or t-shirt, we’ve long been warned of a future ‘end game event’ that Democrats/globalists would ‘manufacture’ then ‘use’ to ‘cement’ tyranny into place.

And while that ‘event’ hasn’t yet arrived in America, possibly bringing with it an unfolding of tyranny of the worst nature, a tyranny sure to be heavily ‘resisted’ by tens of millions of well-armed Americans, we may have recently gotten a small hint of what that ‘event’ might be with globalists/leftists happy to use ‘false flag terrorism’ to accomplish their goals, with false flags getting nations into global wars dating back decades.

So we’re going to be taking a look within this story at that recent ‘event’ that has concerned many in the Washington DC area while looking back at the history of ‘false flag terrorism’, perfectly summed up in this November 29th ANP story by William B. Stoecker titled “The Traitorous CIA’s Role In The Attempted Overthrow Of America Goes Back DECADES Using One False Flag After Another & Their Total Infiltration By America-Hating Communists & Muslims“.

Also perfectly seen in now declassified ‘Operation Northwoods’ which stated.:

Operation Northwoods was a proposed false flag operation against the Cuban government that originated within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the United States government in 1962.

The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other U.S. government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets, blaming them on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba.

The possibilities detailed in the document included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities. The proposals were rejected by President John F. Kennedy.

With those proposals rejected by President Kennedy and JFK then assassinated before he could even finish out his first term in office, as Stoecker pointed out in this story, the ‘CIA/deep state apparatus’ back in the 1960’s is essentially the same group in power in 2019 with ‘continuity of government’ long in place and Operation Northwoods provided Americans 100% proof of Stoecker’s story’s subtitle: “US Intelligence Agency Traitors Have Long Tortured & Murdered Americans With Impunity”.

If anyone were to ‘orchestrate violent terrorism in US cities in 2019’, they’d be shot dead on sight (except, of course, the ‘agent provocateurs’ who are welcomed back to the ‘swamp’ with a heroes welcome!) Surely Operation Northwoods must lead the thinking person to ask, how many more ‘false flag terrorism events’ have been carried out by such ‘agent provocateurs’ and their ‘useful idiots‘ since Kennedy’s assassination? And might the ‘deep state apparatus’ attempt to carry out more such false flags/assassinations in the future? As Global Research reported in this story, there have been AT LEAST 53 confirmed ‘false flag’ events in the past, many of them involving the ‘deep state apparatus’ here in America.

While NBC News reported two weeks ago that the so-called ‘airspace violation‘ that triggered a lockdown at the White House recently could have been triggered by a flock of birds or a weather balloon or even a drone, and that ‘the event‘ was resolved without incident after initial fears of a potentially hostile plane flying into the restricted airspace, WTOP radio in Washington DC reported two days later in this story titled “Inside the frantic response to mysterious ‘slow-moving blob’ flying over Washington” why some are very concerned.

As WTOP had also reported on November 26th story reporting upon the initial alleged violation, NORAD is investigating the event because “They need to know that this was not a deliberate act by somebody to try to trick their system. It is extremely important that their systems be accurate”. Yet as they also reported, they may have witnessed just that with the ‘mysterious slow moving blob‘ detected moving towards the White house that simply ‘disappeared‘ a potential harbinger of danger ahead.

Although some are suggesting Corey is doing this for attention, this problem is very real and we’re beginning to see it unravel all over Hollywood.

It began recently when Harvey Weinstein was outed by many female celebrities as a sexual abuser. It then moved onto others including allegations towards Kevin Spacey about sexual misconduct in his past as well as recently on the set of House of Cards.

After raising just under $200,000 to help protect himself, Feldman has been making media appearances talking about the reality of this pedophilia problem and what he has done about it in the past while others completely ignored it.

During an interview with host Matt Lauer on NBC’s Today, Feldman was asked why he hasn’t come forward with the names already, Feldman responded:

Lauer went on to challenge Feldman about the way he was raising awareness about pedophilia in Hollywood and Feldman replied:

Corey Feldman has been criticized for the fact that he said he would name names in his book Coreyography: A Memoir, but never did. To this Corey states his publisher would not let him.

This here is part of the issue. Publishers have to protect themselves because they don’t want to get into legal issues with high profile people being named. The issue of pedophilia in Hollywood continues on at large because no one wants to face having to hold people accountable.

The Beginning of Something Huge

When p(i)zzagate hit Reddit over a year ago, it moved quickly and traveled fast. In the end, much of the public were convinced by media that p(i)zzagate was all fake.

I truly believe that through this string of admissions and outings in Hollywood, we will later learn that p(i)zzagate was in fact real; and that this issue goes deep into politics and the world’s elite as well.

Satanic Pedophilia Network Exposed in Australia — It Starts at the TOP, Just Like in the USA and UK

As critical thinking continues on in these recent revelations, people have been suggesting that by focusing so hard on the music and film industry, it is pulling attention away from the elite pedophilia that exists in Washington and beyond.

While this is an interesting point, it is important to bring up the fact that the people in the film and music industry are essentially one step down in the pyramid from these ruling elite. Admissions and exposure of these individuals will lead to uncovering what goes on at higher levels as well.

We can already see the relationships and closeness that exist between these high-level politicians and many of these people who are being outed as pedophiles. Therefore the jump from you now outing these people to outing the Washington politicians is not that difficult and will happen eventually. This is a step in the right direction.

Through this process I also strongly believe we are going to be given a deeper understanding into the innocence of Michael Jackson and the pedophilia claims against him.

As Corey Feldman has stated Michael Jackson did not have the same demeanour nor actions of pedophiles he interacted with. Corey Feldman has gone on record multiple times stating Michael is innocent.

The biggest question, if Corey Feldman had given names to the LAPD years ago and yet all they did was focus on trying to find something on Michael Jackson, why was nothing done?

We want to believe there is no ruling elite, that powerful people aren’t doing things to protect themselves and rule over others yet our world suggests, in every way, that that’s precisely what’s happening.

‘Powerful’ people are protected and yet the ones who go out and start to threaten that power via their strong voice get labeled with the type of allegations you can’t publicly come back from like rape or pedophilia. This is what happened with Michael Jackson.

If you aren’t aware, Michael had said on a number of occasions that he was about to reveal a secret to the world on his latest tour before he died. He had also stated that he felt he was going to be killed for what he was revealing to people.

It appears as though when someone is threatening the power structure/deep state, actions are sometimes taken to try and silence or shut these people out. Sometimes they’re even killed.

I believe that Michael’s pedophile label was his first warning from this Elite to say ‘keep quiet and you’ll be okay, but we’re destroying your image.’ Michael chose to continue sharing the truth and I believe he was killed for it."

The ship turned toward the Bab al-Mandeb Straits and the Red Sea.

The new Fajr-5’s have a 200-kilo warhead, which packs a bigger punch than the 175 kilos of explosives delivered by the rockets in current use with the Palestinian terrorists in the Gaza Strip. To extend their range to cover the 85 kilometers from Gaza to Tel Aviv, Hamas removed a part of their payloads to make them lighter.

Tehran is sending the fresh supply of disassembled rockets to replenish the stocks its allies, the Palestinian Hamas and Jihad Islami, depleted in their round-the-clock attacks on Israel since Nov. 10.

To throw Israeli surveillance off the trail, the ship started its voyage called Vali-e Asr owned by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, and was quickly renamed Cargo Star and hoisted the flag of Tuvalu. This South Pacific island nation, which lies between Hawaii and Australia, has a tiny population of 11,000, most of them Polynesians. Iran provides most of its revenue since earlier this year when Prime Minister Willy Telavi agreed to register Iran’s entire tanker fleet of 22 vessels to Tuvalu, to help Tehran dodge the US-EU oil embargo.

The Sudanese will then be told by Tehran whether put into Port Sudan with the missiles, or turn north and sail up the Red Sea to the Straits of Tiran to link up with Egyptian fishing boats which regularly ply this waterway in the service of Palestinian-Iranian smuggling networks. They would unload the missile cargo in a quiet inlet on the Sinai coast. From there, it would be carried to the smuggling tunnels running from Sinai under the border into the Gaza Strip.\

Palestinian teams assisted by Iranian and Hizballah technicians in the Gaza Strip would then assemble the new rockets and make them operational.

Through most of the voyage, two Iranian warships, the Khark heliicopter carrier and Shahid Naqdi destroyer, which are posted permanently in the Red Sea, escorted the arms ship until the cargo changed hands.

DEBKAfile’s Iranian sources also disclose that the Jihad Islami leader Ramadan Abdullah Shelah was sharply remanded by Tehran for meeting Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi in Cairo Sunday to discuss terms for halting Israel’s counter-missile operation in Gaza now in its sixth day.

Iran bankrolls these Palestinian extremists and has no intention of letting Shelah bow to Cairo’s wishes which run counter to Tehran’s plans and interests.

While Egypt’s new Islamist leaders are intent on carving out for themselves a responsible role in the region by restoring order, solving crises and restraining radicals, radical Iran has its own fish to fry and is bent on escalating war tensions in the Middle East. source – DEBKA"

Here are 2 centuries of UK, USA and Australian official death statistics show conclusively and scientifically modern medicine is not responsible for and played little part in substantially improved life expectancy and survival from disease in western economies.

The main advances in combating disease over 200 years have been better food and clean drinking water. Improved sanitation, less overcrowded and better living conditions also contribute.

This is also borne out in published peer reviewed research:



“The questionable contribution of medical measures to the decline of mortality in the United States in the twentieth century“. McKinlay JB, McKinlay SM, Milbank Mem Fund Q Health Soc. 1977 Summer; 55(3): 405-28.

“Symposium: Accomplishments in Child Nutrition during the 20th Century. Infant Mortality in the 20th Century, Dramatic but Uneven Progress” Myron E. Wegman School of Public Health, University of Michigan: J. Nutr. 131: 401S–408S, 2001.

In addition to the extensive static graphs below, the following superb BBC FOUR broadcast by Professor Hans Rosling shows how health improved in step with wealth over the last 200 years “200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers – in just four minutes“:

Here you will also learn why vaccinations like mumps and rubella for children are medically unethical and can expose medical professionals to liability for criminal proceedings and civil damages for administering them.

And do vaccines cause autistic conditions? If you read nothing else we strongly recommend you read this: PDF Download – Text of May 5th 2008 email from US HRSA to Sharyl Attkisson of CBS News]. In it the US Health Resources Services Administration [HRSA] state to CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson:

Despite all the lies and deceit by health official worldwide, the question “do vaccines cause autism” was answered after the Hannah Poling story broke in the USA in February 2008 [see CHS article here]. Hannah developed an autistic condition after 9 vaccines administered the same day.

Under the media spotlight numerous US health officials and agencies conceded on broadcast US nationwide TV news from CBS and CNN. Full details with links to the original sources can be found in this CHS article:

Vaccination Causes Autism – Say US Government and Merck’s Director of Vaccines.

The financial markets have known for 20 years and more the pharmaceutical industry’s blockbuster patented drugs business model would eventually fail. We now see the Bill Gates’ type business model emerging – almost everyone has Windows software on their PC – almost everyone will be vax’ed. Gates quickly became a multi-billionaire.

With vastly more people to vaccinate than computers requiring software the lure of money is many times greater. All this whilst we watch as childhood prevalence of asthma, allergies, autism, diabetes and more have increased exponentially as the vaccines have been introduced.

Can “vaccinatable” diseases “return” despite vaccination? Yes. If you are too poorly nourished your body is likely to lack essential nutrients needed to maintain its immune system sufficiently to withstand disease. This will happen regardless of how many vaccinations you have had. This was experienced in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the old Soviet Bloc and the economic chaos which ensued, leaving many in great poverty.

For the same reason vaccines do not “work” and “save” lives in impoverished African and other third world economies. The majority of third world child deaths still occur despite vaccination. These children need proper food, clean water to drink and wash in and sanitation. We give them vaccines instead.

These third world children die because we have vaccines. In the 21st Century, despite all the claims made about modern science, we have no effective treatments for common basic childhood diseases.

It has been estimated vaccines prevent 25% of the deaths of these children, so 75% still die. If there were effective treatments we could save their lives.

We have no effective treatments because there is no incentive for the drug industry and every incentive for them not to develop them. The World Health Organisation and our health departments worldwide, in thrall to and under the influence of the drug industry, do nothing about it.

Something could be done. This needs political commitment from western developed nations and the courage to stand up against vested commercial interests to develop effective treatments to save lives – children’s lives.

As information like that here has become available, health officials are changing from scaremongering parents into vaccinating with claims their child could die.

Now they claim vaccinating reduces the numbers of cases of disease [ie. instead of deaths] and produce graphs of dramatic falls in reported cases (instead of deaths) when measles vaccine was introduced.

This is again misleading. A dramatic fall in the numbers of reported measles cases would be expected. Doctors substantially overdiagnose measles cases especially when they believe it is a possible diagnosis.

Doctors were told the vaccine prevented children getting measles when introduced in the late 1960′s so after that time a substantial reduction in diagnoses would be expected.

Examples of recent overdiagnoses of measles when there are measles “scares” are proportionately up to 74 times (or 7400% overdiagnosed). Figures and sources follow the next paragraph.

What health officials are also doing is relying on very old and unreliable data which ignores that measles has become progressively milder so the risks of long term injury have diminished – (and death is the most extreme form of long term injury – shown here by official data to have diminished rapidly and substantially over the past 100 years without the risks posed to children’s health by vaccines)."

Rausch as actors.",True,"The article mentions the actions of Al Gore, Pope Francis, and Father John S. Rausch in relation to climate change and environmental concerns.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Former vice president Al Gore told CNN that he would consider converting to Catholicism because of the witness of Pope Francis, particularly in the area of environmental concern.

“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” Matthew 7:15 (KJV)

EDITOR’S NOTE: Al Gore, who has made over a billion dollars so far peddling climate change fear, has a new idol now. It’s none other that the Vicar of Antichrist, the Roman Pope Francis. In fact, Gore likes the pope so much he is now musing about becoming a Catholic. What does Pope Francis do that could compel Al Gore to become a Catholic? Simple, the pope preaches Climate Change, because that’s where all the money is. If you can’t see by now what a scam this whole thing is and how all these fakers are in cahoots together then, brother, you’re brain dead.

“I’m a Protestant, but I’ll tell you, because of Pope Francis, I really could become a Catholic. He is really an amazing spiritual leader,” Gore told Father John S. Rausch, who appeared with him on CNN Tuesday as part of a climate change town hall event.

Gore, who was raised a Southern Baptist, went on to recommend that people of all faith traditions read Pope Francis’s environmental encyclical letter Laudato Si, “which really addressed the question that you’re asking here.”

“There are many who are living in poverty, and they’re not only living in poverty, they’re living right next to polluted streams and mountains that have been destroyed,” Rausch said.

All religions have a messiah, and the high priest of Gaia worship Pope Francis is leading the charge:

The priest went on to assert the need to “influence people to see a spiritual connection in their consumer habits (so) that they can see the consequences of their buying, the consequences have on people in Appalachia and also in other parts of God’s kingdom.”

Father Rausch has said that he drives many thousands of miles each year, but whatever environmental degradation that ensues is worth it because of the important work he is doing.

“Dealing with issues in Appalachia requires me to drive 22,000 miles a year,” he said. “My carbon footprint may be big, but the region is ever expansive and demanding my driving.”

Nonetheless, other people should probably be driving less, the priest suggested, such as those who drive “100 miles for some sporting event” and think nothing of it.

“For essential driving,” he said, “we rely on community members to contribute some of their ‘carbon miles,’ so others can bring compassion to outside situations.”

This is what the false gospel of the Climate Change hoax looks like:

CNN labels this program “The Climate Crisis”, but no one but Liberals thinks it is a crisis. It begins with a falsehood and continues on downward from there.

In his comments, Mr. Gore echoed previous remarks he had made at a town hall event in 2015, where he also suggested that Pope Francis could inspire him to become a Catholic. In May of that year, Gore said in a talk at the University of California, Berkeley that he is inspired by Pope Francis’s leadership on environmental issues.

“I think Pope Francis is quite an inspiring figure really,” he said. “I’ve been startled with the clarity of the moral force that he embodies.” “And I know the vast majority of my Catholic friends are just thrilled to the marrow of their bones that he is providing this kind of spiritual leadership,” he said.

Gore got himself into trouble with black activists last month when he compared the fight against global warming to the emancipation of black slaves.

The fight against global warming is one of humanity’s great moral causes, Gore told participants in the EcoCity World Summit in Melbourne, alongside “the abolition of slavery, woman’s suffrage and women’s rights, the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa.”

In an online statement, black activists with the Project 21 leadership network denounced the comparison, saying that Gore “gives climate change activists unearned moral credibility” by associating these important moral movements of history with a crusade “grounded in questionable data.”

Project 21 Co-Chairman Horace Cooper went further still, saying that Gore’s climate alarmism stands to hurt black Americans most of all.

“Study after study demonstrate that the radical climate policies advocated by Al Gore, Jr. will hurt blacks and the poor most,” Cooper said. “Just as segregation and interracial marriage bans were purported to be for the good of all while clearly done to generate political support, today’s climate alarmism is pushed solely to get the support of a small group of so-called eco-warriors at the expense of blacks.” source"

The three officials held the top roles focusing on Russia, cybersecurity, and intelligence programs at the National Security Council. Their exclusion is likely to raise new questions about the Obama administration’s involvement in the origins of the investigation of the Trump campaign that evolved into the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.

The Obama administration coordinated a series of so-called “small group” meetings in response to Brennan’s intelligence, but excluded three officials who would usually be involved in high-profile work on the topics: White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel, Senior Director for Russia and Eurasia Celeste Wallander, and Senior Director for Intelligence Programs Brett Holmgren.

510,True,"The article discusses FBI agents who are fearful of reprisals and corruption within the FBI, suggesting a hidden agenda or malicious intent.",True,"The article mentions FBI agents, Obama disciples, lawmakers, Congress, DOJ, ranking members, and top managers as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,"The article mentions actions such as speaking out, issuing subpoenas, running the show, breaking the law, framing the President-elect, defending the Whistleblower Protection Act, and retaliatory legal actions.",True,"The article mentions threats to the careers of FBI agents who speak out, as well as threats of retaliation and financial ruin.",True,The article connects events and observations to suggest a larger conspiracy within the FBI and government agencies.,True,"The article suggests secrecy within the FBI and government agencies, with hidden agendas and attempts to mislead the public.","Disheartened FBI agents, fearful of reprisals (if they speak out) from Obama disciples still lurking within the deep state, are calling upon congress to issue subpoenas compelling them to speak.

The highly unusual request from career agents illustrates just how embedded and corrupt the FBI has become. Disgruntled agents are so afraid of retaliation if they voluntarily speak out against the agency, they’ve requested being subpoenaed rather then relying on lawmakers promise of protecting them under the “Whistleblower Law.”

Agents believe that the ambiguity of the law exposes them to career ending risks and revenge from those still hidden deep within the FBI, and will not risk their careers regardless of the evidence they may have to offer.

A former White House official told reporters he knows of two FBI agents who are “hunkering down because they see good people being thrown to the dogs for speaking out and speaking out does nothing to solve the problems.” He believes that “Congress and DOJ are so weak and clueless and can’t be trusted to follow through.”

According to just released transcripts, one special agent said, “It’s a question of basic credibility. Congress, the executive, and oversight are not seen to have any gravitas or seriousness. The inmates have been running the asylum and they don’t respect, much less fear, their overseers. We know we’ll be hung out to dry.”

Adding, “And don’t get me wrong, there are still a few good people scattered about, but main Justice and the bureaucrats are running the show, want to run out the clock on this administration, and keep the status quo.”

He continued, “You still have a ton of bad people in place. Unless that changes and I haven’t seen any degree of seriousness on the part of ranking members nor staffers, I’m not meeting with anyone nor willing to be subpoenaed. I’m not coming forward until they get their act together. Right now, it’d be sacrificing a career for cheap political points.”

When asked about being subpoenaed, another special agent acknowledged, “This is a great opportunity for senior or [soon to be retiring] guys, not for someone like me. It’d be suicide. I hate to say it, but neither the judiciary nor the executive branch is wielding any kind of effective oversight right now, and the top managers know it.”

Moreover a just released Rasmussen poll shows a majority of Americans believe that the 2016 election was illegally rigged for Hillary Clinton to beat Donald Trump, and when that failed senior officials in both the DOJ and FBI broke the law, framing the President-elect regarding the Russian collusion hoax.

The poll was conducted by both telephone and online survey and found that 72% of likely Republicans believe that senior management within both the DOJ and FBI “likely broke the law” in an attempt to stop Donald Trump from becoming elected president.

However only 29% of Democrats believe top law enforcement officials “likely broke the law” still that number is significant because it increased the “likely” vote from 22% to 29% among Democrats, a jump of 7% from an earlier poll conducted in February

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley defended the Whistleblower Protection Act he spearheaded through congress stating, “I’ve worked hard to strengthen legal protections, especially for FBI employees. You have a right to cooperate with Congressional inquiries, just as you have a right to cooperate with the Inspector General. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.”

Grassley obviously isn’t listening to those individuals who stepped forward in reporting malfeasance. Although the bill does a credible job in protecting the whistleblower from unfair prosecution, it does little in protecting the whistleblower from going bankrupt defending themselves legally against retaliatory legal actions by those agencies looking to simply tie the whistleblower into financial litigation, with the sole intent of driving them into financial ruin, and sending a message to others.

Case in point: In 2013 an FBI agent came forward to report a series of FBI improprieties committed by some senior agents, under the Whistleblower Protection Act, and found himself experiencing “personal humiliation, stress-related illnesses, and a huge financial loss, requiring my wife (who had undergone two cancer surgeries) to go to work so we could make ends meet.”

Moreover the use of a subpoena can give the whistleblower financial protection should the renegade agency attempt any legal financial reprisals as a weapon to intimidate and bankrupt the agent.

One congressional source said, “It would force whatever agency the [government worker] is from to pay for attorney’s fees should they retaliate.”"

The stock market tumbled once again today, capping its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis as investors continue to be worried over COVID-19’simpact on the economy, never mind the fact that the seasonal flu sickens and kills more people in the United States than the coronavirus:
• According to the , as of the week ending February 22, 2020, there have been 32 million to 45 million flu illnesses; 310,000 to 560,000 flu hospitalizations; and 18,000 to 45,000 flu deaths in the 2019-2020 flu season in the United Statees.
• As of today, February 28, 2020, there are only 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States, but not a single death. The states with confirmed cases of COVID-19 are Arisona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Washington, and Wisconsin. ( )
• As of today, February 28, there are 82,294 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,804 COVID-19 deaths in the world. China accounts for 78,630 of the cases and 2,747 of the deaths. ( )

Not content with the precipitous stock market drop from the coronavirus hysteria, 51-year-old actress Patricia Arquette posted a malicious message to Instagram urging people to participate in a one-day economic shutdown on March 2 in order to hurt President Donald Trump by inflicting even more damage on the U.S. economy.

Arquette tells her followers to refrain from making any purchases — presumably, including food and medication — for a 24-hour period to “cause a $238.2 billion dollar blip on the federal government’s records.”

David Ng reports for Breitbart that it is unclear who is organizing the boycott, but it appears to have originated with the Twitter account @Lee8772, which said that there will be similar day-long boycotts each month through this November’s election. Only emergency purchases will be exempted from the boycott. @Lee8772 says:

Arquette isn’t the first Hollywood celebrity to advocate for damaging the U.S. economy in order to hurt President Trump, even if it means ordinary Americans will have to bear the brunt of a slowdown. The unfunny self-proclaimed comedian Bill Maher has repeatedly said on his HBO show that he hopes the U.S. goes into a recession if it means that the Trump administration will suffer. He said in 2018: “I hope for a recession to get rid of Trump. Sorry if that hurts people.”

I like and second this response to Arquette’s malicious call to tank the economy from Instagrammer jenrac16:

According to the BBC, there are now 17 different police forces investigating past, recent and current abuse claims.

The surging numbers of abuse claims come on the heels of former Newcastle United footballer David Eatock coming out five days ago and publicly claiming that a former coach, George Ormond, sexually abused David between 50-100 times as David was growing up.

David Eatock began speaking out after he saw another former footballer, Andy Woodward, come forward in an interview with The Guardian, which happened about about two weeks ago.

The police are encouraging others to come forward in hopes of snowballing the awareness around this sort of abuse that is often hidden and rarely talked about.

Clearly, with over 860 calls in the first week of a new hotline being setup, people are speaking out more and more.

If recent events hint towards what is happening on a global scale, we have only seen the beginning of what is to become known in regards to pedophilia and child/human trafficking.

On Sunday December 4th, The Independent reported that Scotland Yard has been given more money to investigate an “important new lead” in the case of the then 3 year old missing girl named Madeleine McCann.

Interestingly, the McCann family found out just this past June that former UK journalist Clement Freud, grandson of famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, had a villa less than a mile away from where Madeleine went missing back in 2007.

To add to it, Clement Freud was a known pedophile (formally exposed as one after he died).

Interestingly, it is now known thanks to the Wikileaks email dump, that the Podesta’s often visited Portugal and visited a friend named “Clem.” Could it be Clement Freud?

Though, just since they visited the same country that Madeleine went missing in doesn’t mean much. However, when the suspects’ images look nearly identical to John and Tony Podesta, one begins to question the official narrative.

And here is The Guardian’s official release of the suspect’s images:

It is interesting to note that right now we are seeing a tremendous surge in activity regarding what has become known as Pizza.

This refers to claims being made that the Podestas are involved in a massive, elite pedophilia syndicate, which has also implicated Comet Ping Pong, located in Washington D.C. (Allegedly Comet Ping Pong is located at the bottom of an upside down pentagram that is directly in line with the location of the White House).

With all of this activity and speculation about the Podesta’s and many other elites involved in this pedophile ring and their possible connection to Madeleine McCann, it is highly significant that Scotland Yard is now re-investigating the case of Madeleine due to new “important” lead.

Could the dots be connecting? We’ll see.

While some may wish to push all of this off as some massive “conspiracy” not based in reality, remember back to the beginning of this story when over 860 people called in during 1 week to report claims of former or current sexual abuse.

This is not some wild theory. These things happen and it is time we see it for what it is.

The more people that know about these things, as sick and terrible as they are, the quicker we can rescue those being trafficked and abused and bring healing to this entire situation.

In addition to recent claims, it has been reported by The Telegraph just two days ago that police are now investigating 15 different claims that Sir Edward Heath (now dead), sexually abused multiple children while he served as the Prime Minister’s armed protection officer.

Additionally, over the years, the Vatican has paid nearly $4 billion dollars to victims of pedophilia, which stemmed from clergy members abusing children.

We must also remember back to when it was alleged that former BBC broadcaster Jimmy Savile was sexually abusing children, but was put off as a “conspiracy theory” only until after he died, when literally hundreds of people came forward to prove that he did sexually abuse children.

Also, it has been said that the current New York Times CEO Mark Thompson helped to cover up the Jimmy Savile scandal, as Thompson worked at the BBC as the Director-General during a period where Savile was still abusing children, and even some abuse cases happened on live television.

While there is so much more that could be written about this topic, what is important to take away from this is that there is a lot of activity regarding pedophilia coming out into the public’s awareness.

There is a snowball effect taking place. Remember what the Buddha said:

Here is news of the Third World War. The United States has invaded Africa. US troops have entered Somalia, extending their war front from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Yemen and, now, the Horn of Africa. In preparation for an attack on Iran, American missiles have been placed in four Persian Gulf states, and “bunker-buster” bombs are said to be arriving at the US base on the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.

 

 In Gaza, the sick and abandoned population, mostly children, is being entombed behind underground American-supplied walls in order to reinforce a criminal siege. In Latin America, the Obama administration has secured seven bases in Colombia, from which to wage a war of attrition against the popular democracies in Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay. Meanwhile, the Secretary of “Defense” Robert Gates complains that “the general [European] public and the political class” are so opposed to war they are an “impediment” to peace. Remember this is the month of the March hare.

According to an American general, the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan is not so much a real war as a “war of perception.” Thus, the recent “liberation of the city of Marja” from the Taliban’s “command and control structure” was pure Hollywood. Marja is not a city; there was no Taliban command and control. The heroic liberators killed the usual civilians, poorest of the poor. Otherwise, it was fake. A war of perception is meant to provide fake news for the folks back home, to make a failed colonial adventure seem worthwhile and patriotic, as if “The Hurt Locker” were real, and parades of flag-wrapped coffins through the Wiltshire town of Wooten Basset were not a cynical propaganda exercise.

“War is fun,” the helmets in Vietnam used to say with bleakest irony, meaning that if a war is revealed as having no purpose other than to justify voracious power in the cause of lucrative fanaticisms, such as the weapons industry, the danger of truth beckons. This danger can be illustrated by the liberal perception of Tony Blair in 1997 as one “who wants to create a world [where] ideology has surrendered entirely to values” (Hugo Young, the Guardian) compared with today’s public reckoning of a liar and war criminal.

Western war states such as the US and Britain are not threatened by the Taliban or any other introverted tribesmen in faraway places, but by the antiwar instincts of their own citizens. Consider the draconian sentences handed down in London to scores of young people who protested Israel’s assault on Gaza in January last year. Following demonstrations in which paramilitary police “kettled” (corralled) thousands, first-offenders have received two and a half years in prison for minor offences that would not normally carry custodial sentences. On both sides of the Atlantic, serious dissent exposing illegal war has become a serious crime.

Silence in other high places allows this moral travesty. Across the arts, literature, journalism and the law, liberal elites, having hurried away from the debris of Blair and, now, Obama, continue to fudge their indifference to the barbarism and aims of Western state crimes by promoting retrospectively the evils of their convenient demons, like Saddam Hussein. With Harold Pinter gone, try compiling a list of famous writers, artists and advocates whose principles are not consumed by the “market” or neutered by their celebrity. Who among them have spoken out about the holocaust in Iraq during almost 20 years of lethal blockade and assault? And all of it has been deliberate. On January 22, 1991, the US defense Intelligence Agency predicted in impressive detail how a blockade would systematically destroy Iraq’s clean water system and lead to “increased incidences, if not epidemics of disease.” So, the US set about eliminating clean water for the Iraqi population: one of the causes, noted UNICEF, of the deaths of half a million Iraqi infants under the age of five. But this extremism apparently has no name.

Norman Mailer once said he believed the United States, in its endless pursuit of war and domination, had entered a “pre-fascist era.” Mailer seemed tentative, as if trying to warn about something even he could not quite define. “Fascism” is not right, for it invokes lazy historical precedents, conjuring yet again the iconography of German and Italian repression. On the other hand, American authoritarianism, as the cultural critic Henry Giroux pointed out recently, is “more nuance, less theatrical, more cunning, less concerned with repressive modes of control than with manipulative modes of consent.”

This is Americanism, the only predatory ideology to deny that it is an ideology. The rise of tentacular corporations that are dictatorships in their own right and of a military that is now a state with the state, set behind the façade of the best democracy 35,000 Washington lobbyists can buy, and a popular culture programmed to divert and stultify, is without precedent. More nuanced perhaps, but the results are both unambiguous and familiar. Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, the senior United Nations officials in Iraq during the American and British-led blockade, are in no doubt they witnessed genocide. They saw no gas chambers. Insidious, undeclared, even presented wittily as enlightenment on the march, the Third World War and its genocide proceeded, human being by human being.

In the coming election campaign in Britain, the candidates will refer to this war only to laud “our boys.” The candidates are almost identical political mummies shrouded in the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes. As Blair demonstrated a bit too eagerly, the British elite love America because America allows it to barrack and bomb the natives and call itself a “partner.” We should interrupt their fun."
514,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions powerful actors, such as the international bankers, the military industrial complex, and the media, who are responsible for the permanent war and its consequences.",True,"The article discusses the actions of the powerful actors, such as stealing oil and natural resources, destabilizing the West, and enforcing imperialistic policies.",True,"The article mentions the deaths of innocent victims, including children, as a consequence of the actions of the powerful actors.",False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey missing information or show intentions to mislead the public.,"Images of Syrian Boy Remind Us of the Forgotten Victims of Permanent War

In the above snapshot taken this week, 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh is shown after his home in Aleppo, Syria was targeted by airstrikes and rescue crews then pulled him from the rubble. His family is dead. The video and images of Omran have gone ‘viral’ on the internet in recent days, reminding us who exactly it is who pays the price in endless, inter-generational warfare.

Watch the video of his rescue here…

The short-term goal of the Orwellian permanent war was to steal oil and other natural resources from the Middle East, to prevent rogue nations from skirting the influence of the international bankers by trading for oil in currencies other than the petro-dollar, and to provide a profit center and testing ground for the military industrial complex. The long-term goals have to do with destabilization of the West in order to force a police state and dictatorial world government on formerly democratic nations by creating so much chaos and instability that once free people would happily accept tyranny.

All of these goals are being achieved, yet it’s hard to tell by watching the mainline news sources, as they’re role is to keep our attention and the conversation directed on more superficial matters like sports, elections, crime and natural disasters. The puppet masters in our world simply don’t care who they kill in their quest to bring the world under their control, and the media support them by remaining largely silent.

After George H.W. Bush’s ‘Persian Gulf War,‘ sanctions against Iraq are widely known to have caused the deaths of nearly 600,000 Iraqi children as the result of malnutrition and lack of access to medicines and medical care. Again, the elite don’t care, in fact, the opposite is true. They believe that their job is to kill enough people to bring about a submission by whomever they deem to be our enemies.

Just consider comments of former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who is quoted here:

This is coming from a woman and mother of three, who in a 1996 episode of 60 Minutes entitled ‘Punishing Saddam,’ was asked if it was worth it for the U.S. to have directly contributed to the deaths of over half a million Iraqi children in order to enforce imperialistic policies in the Middle East. To punish one man.

She is also quoted as saying:

Meanwhile, in modern-day America, politicians and political candidates are allowed to omit the truth about the consequences of their policies and actions with no pressure at all from a controlled media, and the mindlessness of a willingly ignorant public. A president can win the Nobel Peace Prize while drone bombing families and selling arms to anyone and everyone, but the reality remains: war is a racket and most of the victims are totally innocent.

Furthermore, recently hacked emails from billionaire George Soros how active he is in supporting global chaos, again proving that the wealthy elite in our world are quite ready to use their money, influence and power to advance elitist political agendas at the expense of life, stability and morality. Meanwhile, the truest victims of imperialism and militarism remain the children and families who just happen to be in the kill zones when the bombs get dropped.

‘Collateral damage’ is what they call it when a child or a family ends up being blown to bits.

Images like those of 5-year-old Syrian boy Omran Daqneesh seem to be of great interest to people spending time on social media in the comfort of their homes and offices, yet when it comes to holding our supposed leaders accountable for atrocities like these, the silence is absolutely deafening. Had he been killed, we would not be sharing his story, but this image is just too powerful to ignore.

 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.

 I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.

 Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away,

 not the smallest letter or the smallest part of a letter

 will pass from the law,

 until all things have taken place.

 Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments

 and teaches others to do so

 will be called least in the kingdom of heaven.

 But whoever obeys and teaches these commandments

 will be called greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

 I tell you, unless your righteousness surpasses

 that of the scribes and Pharisees,

 you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

If you choose you can keep the commandments,

 they will save you;

 if you trust in God, you too shall live;

 he has set before you fire and water

 to whichever you choose, stretch forth your hand.

 Before man are life and death, good and evil,

 whichever he chooses shall be given him.

1. I am the Lord your God: you shall not have strange Gods before me:

Do I accord more importance to creation — to people and things? Do I idolize entertainers or politicians, idealizing and placing them on a pedestal? Am I my own god — grandiose, arrogant, and do as I will? Do I subscribe to a self-serving moral relativism– that what is right depends on the situation and on what benefits me? Do I practice humility by serving others? Do I ask for forgiveness when I have wronged another?

2. You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain:

Have my words denied, devalued, or insulted God? Do I use His holy name as a profanity, or as an emotional outburst?

3. Remember to keep holy the Lord’s Day:

Do I avoid, when possible, work that impedes worship to God, joy for the Lord’s Day, and proper relaxation of mind and body? Do I look for ways to spend time with family or in service on Sunday? Do I say “Thank You” for all that He’s given me — my body, mind, work, family, friends, and for life itself?

4. Honor your father and your mother:

Do I show my parents due respect? Do I seek to maintain good communication with my parents where possible? Do I criticize them for lacking skills I think they should have? Do I blame them for my own flaws and problems? Do I honor that which they gave birth to by treating my body and mind with respect, and refraining from impairing and corrupting myself with drugs, indolence, and pornography?

5. You shall not kill:

Have I killed the body, no matter how small, of another? Have I injured another’s body, spirit and emotions with my actions and words?

6. You shall not commit adultery:

Have I stayed true to my marital vows? If unmarried, have I honored another’s marital exclusivity? Have I respected the physical and sexual dignity of others and of myself, and of the institution of marriage?

7. You shall not steal:

Have I taken or wasted the possessions, resources or time that belong to another? Have I dis-respected God’s creation by being wasteful and profligate?

8. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor:

Have I told lies or embellished stories at the expense of another?

9. You shall not covet your neighbor’s spouse:

Have I honored my spouse with my full affection and exclusive love? Have I, instead, longed for or lusted after another, including fantasy figures?

10. You shall not covet your neighbor’s goods:

Am I content with what I have, or do I compare myself to others, and feel envious, resentful, or entitled to what others have?

May the peace and love of Jesus Christ our Lord be with you,"
516,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions Charles Nenner as a renowned geopolitical and financial cycle expert.,True,The article discusses Nenner's instructions to his clients to sell stocks and his predictions on interest rates and gold prices.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey any secrecy or attempts to mislead.,"Renowned geopolitical and financial cycle expert Charles Nenner says his “stock market cycle has topped.” Look no further than the more than 400 point pounding on Monday for proof. Nenner says, “If we see a good close on the S&P futures for March below 3230, that’s only a couple of points away from here. Then we get lower price targets, and then this could turn into something much more serious. . . . These bull markets don’t stop on a dime. So, we can go up and down and up and down. . . . People always think there is a buying opportunity . . . but this market will go down in a strong, strong way.”

Nenner is not waiting. He is instructing his clients that “It’s time to sell. We are totally out of stocks. . . . There is a difference between insiders and small investors. Small investors are upset if they miss another two or three percent to the upside, while the big investor is afraid they can lose 40% to the downside. I am afraid they can lose 40% to the downside. I am standing aside unless I see something totally different.”

On interest rates, Nenner predicted months ago that rates would go down, and they did. What does Nenner say now? Nenner says, “The same thing . . . this is going to continue for most of the year. Again, we don’t know what the news is. It could be a rush for safety. It could be a recession. It could be deflation. . . . I think we will have a deflationary crisis, and that’s why interest rates will go much lower.”

On the Fed trying to suppress interest rates by flooding the repo market with cheap money, Nenner says, “People that thought they were safe and had money put aside are having to go back to work when they are 80 years old. So, the Fed could maybe succeed in what they do, but they are bringing down the whole system.”

On gold, Nenner still stands by his prediction that “gold will go to $2,500 per ounce” in the next few years. Nenner explains, “Cycles show me that gold and silver will be going up for a couple of years. . . . I take profits in a short term top, but people say that Mr. Nenner says the long term top is $2,500. So, I am in for the long term. The problem is it can go to $1,890 and then suddenly to $1,470, and they get afraid and sell out and no more long term investment. . . . If you are strong enough, let it go to $2,500, but never get weak even if it goes down. Be a long term investor. . . . $2,500 gold could take three years.”

How much higher could gold go in the longer term? Nenner says, “I made the calculation that if the system breaks down and we have to go back to the gold standard, then gold would be around $60,000 per ounce. Who knows what’s going to happen.”

Another one of Nenner’s cycles that has turned up is the “War Cycle.” Nenner says, “Remember a few years ago, I said the internal war cycle was more frightening than the external war cycle, especially for the United States. We are going to have social unrest and uprising that is going to be more dangerous, and that is more dangerous than the United States going to war. . . . What we are looking for is the big war that still has to come. I still say I don’t think it comes in the Middle East. It will come in the South China Sea. . . . Just because it’s time.”

Rickards explains, “I think the markets will have a very violent reversal in late November or early December. Let me be specific about why because I never make claims like this without backing it up. . . . Here’s what’s going on. Right now, markets are priced for a Fed rate hike in December. . . . The stock market is interpreting this rate hike as economic strength . . . everything is set for a violent reversal because the Fed is not going to hike interest rates in December.”

So, why is the Fed not going to raise rates? Rickards says it’s because of not enough inflation and way too much deflation. This has the Fed scared to move. Rickards contends, “Why is deflation a central bank’s worst nightmare? The answer is deflation increases the real value of debt. In other words, the dollar actually gets stronger in a deflationary environment. If I owe you dollars, and the dollar just got stronger, I owe you more money in real terms. It becomes more difficult to pay off debt in a deflationary environment because my income is drying up. The real burden of debt is going up, and if I couldn’t pay you to begin with, deflation is going to make it more difficult to repay you. . . . Imagine if we had one or two percent deflation . . . and the value of the debt was going up. The defaults would be even worse. Bad debts would pile up. The banking system would be under threat. Tax collections would go down in nominal terms. The credit of the U.S. government would be called into question. The U.S. government might default. These are all the horrendous consequences of deflation, and it’s why central banks cannot have deflation.”

So, what happens if Rickards is correct and the Fed does not raise rates? Rickards says, “When that happens, and I think it will happen . . . all of a sudden, the dollar is going to get weaker, the euro is going to get stronger, gold is going to go up and bonds are going to rally. So, there will be a lot of big market effects. I am not talking the end of the world . . . . I am not talking about a total meltdown. I am talking about a violent repricing of some major commodities and bonds . . . because the market thinks the Fed is going to raise, and they’re not.”

Is there a danger in October as many believe there could be? Rickards says “yes,” and it comes from increased tensions with North Korea. Rickards says, “We have a window from October 10th to October 21st. What is the significance of that window? October 10th is the anniversary of the communist party of North Korea. Kim Jong Un is getting ready to test more missiles. . . . We have two catalysts. The anniversary on October 10th and war games (with South Korea) on October 21st. In that window is when I expect one or more missile tests. That’s going to be another wake up call to the markets. The markets are sleepwalking . . . they don’t understand this war is coming, and it is coming. A shooting war, a pre-emptive war, a kinetic war with the United States against North Korea, I do expect by mid-2018. . . . Kim Jong Un thinks we are bluffing. We are not.”

Rickards also restates his case for “$10,000 gold” and contends it’s at a relatively low price, and people should buy it now and simply hold it.

Since he’s been saying that, he’s been attacked. Let’s go back to Michael Flynn. Trump and Flynn say the CIA has become too politicized. A lot of these agencies have been wasting money and giving us bad information. That was what a lot of Flynn was about. Let’s not forget that Obama dumped Flynn because those were the things that Flynn was saying that Obama didn’t want to hear.”

The issues dreamed up to take out Trump have been ongoing since the day Trump won the 2016 election. Celente lists the top three and says, “The first issue was the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming. The second one was the Electoral College, and you remember the third one? It was we need a vote recount in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. That’s all we heard. The media has been attacking Trump from day one. They are bringing in the Flynn thing because he was an anti-neocon. That’s the reason. The neocons want war. They want destruction. They want the military industrial complex to continue to build. . . . I don’t know why Trump is still campaigning. He should keep his people off the air. They shouldn’t go on the presstitute networks.”

Celente says Trump can win by playing his own game. When it comes to his own GOP party, Celente explains, “He didn’t need them. He doesn’t need them now. Trump beat Hollywood. He beat the Katzenbergs, the Spielbergs, the Clooneys and De Niros. He beat Silicon Valley. . . . What I am saying is Trump can beat and win. He beat all of them. He beat Obama. It wasn’t the Russians that made the election go his way. . . . Play the Trump card. There are no rules. That is the lesson.”

Celente says that Trump is inheriting a U.S. and global economy that is bullish for gold prices. Celente explains, “The debt crisis continues to build. The people are in an uproar about getting their pensions robbed from them. There are more taxes on them to give the money to the banks that did the dirty deals. Look beyond the United States, and we do not give financial advice, gold is the ultimate safe haven asset in a time of economic turmoil and geopolitical instability. . . . Our forecast for gold, and let’s say the price is $1,240 per ounce, the downside is another $100 to $150 per ounce. It cost more than that to pull it out of the ground. So, it’s not going to go much lower than that ($1,240) . . . . That’s no downside risk. Here’s our forecast on the upside. Gold has to break above $1,400 per ounce and solidify over that price, somewhere in the $1,440 to 1,480 range. Once it solidifies in that range, we are saying it’s going to spike to over $2,000 per ounce. That’s our forecast, and we have been saying that for the better part of a year and a half.”

The American people have been lied to, robbed, deceived and betrayed by multitudes of our treasonous leaders. When I speak out against the “evils in government,” I am NOT speaking about government itself, for government is ordained of God; I am talking about those criminals who have betrayed their oath of office, swindling the public, committing high treason, sinning against God in Heaven by oppressing and hurting the citizens they were entrusted to serve.

Our troops aren't fighting for freedom, they're fighting for Dick Cheney's Halliburton. Police brutality is epidemic in America. The corporate State is a fascist State! On the day before the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, dirty-bag Donald Rumsfeld, said $2,300,000,000,000 (2.3 trillion) were MISSING from the Pentagon! Yeah right... missing! The next day a bomb blew up (there was no jet plane) that totally destroyed the financial records which could have indicted Rumsfeld and the culprits who stole that taxpayer money!!! We have entered into the Twilight Zone ladies and gentlemen!

The New World Order is the corporate criminal takeover of governments. U.S. President Kennedy tried to warn us, 10-days before he was assassinated. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God (Daniel 3:17-18). We are living in perilous times (2nd Timothy 3:1-5) of unprecedented evil.

While in one hand they are supplying the weaponry to destroy Yemen, on the other hand, they are providing humanitarian aid to the now destroyed War torn country.

Britain is to increase spending on humanitarian aid to war-torn Yemen while at the same time signing off multibillion-pound arms deals to Saudi Arabia, which stands accused of war crimes. International Development Secretary Priti Patel announced Britain will send an additional £37 million (US$48 million) in aid to Yemen this year, bringing the total package to £100 million.

Johnson has refused to block UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the government has rejected calls for a vote in Parliament on the matter. The foreign secretary maintains there is no evidence international law has been violated in the Yemen conflict, where Saudi Arabia has led a coalition of nations fighting Houthi rebels since March last year. Patel defended the UK’s weapons exports to Saudi Arabia – which totaled £3 billion last year – saying the government has a “robust policy and position” on arms controls.



 Only yesterday we reported on the Saudi Jets That Killed Nearly 50 Civilians In Yemen’s Hudaydah – The current death toll since the strikes began in 2015 is unknown, but estimated at around 10,000, with 93% of the dead being civilians."

Hobbes said that absolute power does not come from an imposition from above but by the choice of individuals who feel more protected renouncing to their own freedom and granting it to a third party.

With this, you are going on anesthetizing the minds with corrupted Mass Media with Amuchina (a brand of disinfectant promoted by Mass Media) and NLP, with words like “regime”, “to allow” and “to permit”, to the point of allowing you to regulate our emotional ties and feelings and certify our affects.

So, in this way, Phase 2 is nothing else than the persecution/continuation of Phase 1 – you just changed the name, as you did with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). We have understood people, for sure, don’t die for the virus alone. So people will be allowed to die and suffer, thanks to you and your laws, for misery and poverty. And, as in the “best” regimes, the blame will be dropped only on citizens. You take away our freedom and say that we looked for it. Divide et Impera (Divide and Rule).

It is our children who will lose more, who are ‘raped souls’, with the help of the so-called “guarantor of their rights” and of CISMAI (Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse). In this way, the right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, to get them used to slavery – involuntary treatment and to virtual lager. All this in exchange for a push-scooter and a tablet. All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, conflict well represented by the WHO, whose main financier is the well-known “philanthropist and savior of the world” Bill Gates.

We all know it, now. Bill Gates, already in 2018, predicted a pandemic, simulated in October 2019 at the “Event 201”, together with Davos (Switzerland). For decades, Gates has been working on Depopulation policy and dictatorial control plans on global politics, aiming to obtain the primacy on agriculture, technology and energy.

Gates said, I quote exactly from his speech:

With his vaccines, Gates managed to sterilize millions of women in Africa. Gates caused a polio epidemic that paralyzed 500,000 children in India and still today with DTP, Gates causes more deaths than the disease itself. And he does the same with GMOs designed by Monsanto and “generously donated” to needy populations. All this while he is already thinking about distributing the quantum tattoo for vaccination recognition and mRNA vaccines as tools for reprogramming our immune system. In addition, Gates also does business with several multinationals that own 5G facilities in the USA.

On this table there is the entire Deep State in Italian sauce: Sanofi, together with GlaxoSmithKline are friends of the Ranieri Guerra, Ricciardi, and of the well-known virologist that we pay 2000 Euro every 10 minutes for the presentations on Rai (Italian state TV. She’s probably talking about Burioni). Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline sign agreements with medical societies to indoctrinate future doctors, making fun of their autonomy of judgment and their oath.

Hi-Tech multinationals, like the Roman Engineering which is friend of the noble Mantoan, or Bending Spoons, of Pisano, which are there for control and manage our personal health datas in agreement with the European Agenda ID2020 of electronic identification, which aims to use mass vaccination to obtain a digital platform of digital ID. This is a continuation of the transfer of data started by Renzi to IBM. Renzi, in 2016, gave a plus 30% to Gates Global Fund.

On the Deep State table there are the people of Aspen, like the Saxon Colao, who with his 4-pages reports, paid 800 Euros/hour, with no scientific review, dictates its politics as a Bilderberg general as he is, staying away from the battlefield. The list is long. Very long. In the list there is also Mediatronic, by Arcuri and many more.

The Italian contribution to the International Alliance Against Coronavirus will be of 140 million Euros, of which 120 million Euros will be given to GAVI Alliance, the non-profit by Gates Foundation. They are just a part of the 7.4 billion Euro fund by the EU to find a vaccine against Coronavirus – vaccines which will be used as I said before.

No money, of course for serotherapy, which has the collateral effect of being super cheap. No money for prevention, a real prevention, which includes our lifestyles, our food and our relationship with the environment.

The real goal of all of this is total control. Absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty and free will. All this thanks to tricks/hoax disguised as political compromises. While you rip up the Nuremberg code with involuntary treatment, fines and deportation, facial recognition and intimidation, endorsed by dogmatic scientism – protected by our “Multi-President” of the Republic who is real cultural epidemic of this country.

We, with the people, will multiply the fires of resistance in a way that you won’t be able to repress all of us.

I ask you, President, to be the spokesperson and give an advice to our President Conte: Dear Mr. President Conte, next time you receive a phone call from the philanthropist Bill Gates forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. If you won’t do this, tell us how we should define you, the “friend lawyer” who takes orders from a criminal."

Stephen O’Brien, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said on Friday that he was “deeply disturbed” by the news that civilians had been killed in Wednesday evening’s bombing.

“I call for a swift, transparent and impartial investigation into this incident,” O’Brien said in a statement.

“Real accountability for parties to conflict, whether they are states or non-state groups, is urgently needed, to ensure that the commitment under international law to protect civilians is meaningful,” he added.

O’Brien quoted Yemen’s ministry of public health as saying that at least 47 people were killed and 35 were injured, among them many women and children, in the strike.

Medical sources confirmed at least 28 deaths to AFP news agency.

The raid hit a house where dozens of people were celebrating in the town of Sanban in Dhamar province, 100km south of the capital Sanaa, residents said.

It was the second alleged air strike by the Saudi-led coalition on a Yemeni wedding party in just over a week.

But the coalition, under mounting criticism over the civilian death toll of its bombing campaign against Houthi rebels, denied any involvement in the latest attack.

O’Brien noted that 4,500 civilians have been killed or injured since the Saudi-led coalition began air strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen in March.

“That is more than in any country or crisis in the world during the same period,” he noted.

Last week, the United Nations passed a watered down resolution backed by Saudi Arabia to set up a national inquiry into human rights violations."

It also mentions the risk of an outbreak of contagious diseases due to the living conditions caused by the sanctions.",False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey missing information or show intentions to mislead the public.,"President of Iran’s Academy of Medical Sciences Seyed Alireza Marandi, in a letter to the European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini, warned that Washington’s economic terrorism against Tehran is hurting the health status of ordinary people in the country.

“As the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Academy of Medical Sciences, which has a duty to monitor the health of our citizens, I would like to declare a number of points to you regarding the outrageous sanctions against our innocent people,” Marandi, a former health minister and parliament member, wrote in a letter to Mogherini.

“The illegal sanctions based on evidence and documentation and as stated in the several correspondences that I have had with the UN Secretary-General, have limited the access to medicine and vital medical equipment leading to critical health conditions and the death of many innocent patients,” he highlighted.

“The use of brutal sanctions has led to a reduction in the value of the national currency, a decrease in the public's purchasing power, and rising prices. As a result, providing affordable healthy food for many people has become problematic. Therefore, the US-led economic warfare and terrorism has had a direct impact on the health of the community,” Marandi cautioned.

“Major events, such as flooding in parts of our country in recent months, have seriously damaged houses and living conditions for many people, and unfortunately, cruel sanctions have prevented international financial aid and even aid from fellow Iranians abroad to reach the people in need. Meanwhile, soaring summer temperatures increase the risk of an outbreak of contagious diseases among these people,” he went on saying.

“Given the above, what is certain is that the problems related to supplying food and medicine cannot be solved through the utterly inadequate and unreliable mechanisms you intend to create. The entire sanctions regime must be lifted or ignored, our oil exported, and normal banking and financial exchanges resumed in accordance with the nuclear deal in order to resolve these problems. The compassionate and hardworking medical community in the Islamic Republic of Iran, over the last forty years, has been struggling for the wellbeing of our people. This was especially evident during the imposed war when western countries provided Saddam Hussein with chemical weapons and as numerous layers of illegal and inhumane sanctions were imposed. This question will always remain in the minds of our medical community, why should our people suffer under these barbaric sanctions while the self-proclaimed champions of human rights are silent and complicit,” he highlighted.

Late in May, the Academy of Medical Sciences of Iran, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, complained that the United States' unilateral sanctions against the Iranian nation had adversely affected the medical treatment of Iranian patients, deploring that the American bans have blocked the flow of international humanitarian aid to flood-hit victims of the country.

On May 08, 2018, President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, officially named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and unleashed the “toughest ever” economic sanctions against Tehran.

Officially, the measures exempt humanitarian goods, such as medicine and medicinal instruments. But in reality, they have had negative impacts on Iran’s health sector and restricted the country’s access to medical and health services.

Back in April, Iran's First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri voiced concern over the impacts of the US sanctions on supplying drugs and medical equipment for the patients in the country, calling on the international bodies to stand against Washington's illegal policies."

Air travel is “the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19”

Scientists in Brazil have found that the countries most affected by the coronavirus spread are the ones who continued to allow unrestricted travel across their borders, prompting further arguments that the most effective method of preventing the spread is tighter frontier controls.

The research, carried out by the Federal University of Bahia in Salvador, suggests that screening and quarantining those coming into countries from outside could have been “a cheap solution for humanity”.

The researchers based their analysis on records of 7,834 airports, using online flight databases documenting 67,600 transport routes in 65 countries.

The scientists factored in a number of forces, including climate, socioeconomic factors, as well economic and air transport, in an attempt to ascertain how the size of outbreaks was affected in 65 countries which had more than 100 cases.

The overwhelming factor was found to be air travel, leading to a conclusion that it is “the main explanation for the growth rate of COVID-19.”

The study notes that “The 2019 – 2020 world spread of COVID-19 highlights that improvements and testing of board control measures (i.e. screening associated with fast testing and quarantine of infected travellers) might be a cheap solution for humanity in comparison to health systems breakdowns and unprecedented global economic crises that the spread of infectious disease can cause.”

The data tallies with the fact that the US and the UK, which have the first and third highest air travel globally, have also suffered the most COVID-19 deaths with 74,600 and 30,615, respectively so far.

The US did not close its airports until late March, while Britain’s borders have remained completely open with little to no testing or quarantining of incoming travellers happening at all.

On the other hand, nations like Austria, Denmark and New Zealand closed their borders within days of their first confirmed cases, and have experienced much fewer deaths.

Austria in particular has enacted tight border controls, refusing entry to anyone without a medical certificate confirming they had tested negative for the virus, and placing a mandatory 14 day quarantine on those who do not have them. The country has suffered just 68 deaths per million of its population, with only 606 overall.

Denmark closed its borders to all non-citizens in mid March, only excluding those with ‘credible purpose’ such as non-citizen Danish residents. The Scandinavian nation has recorded just 503 deaths.

The UK, on the other hand has allowed some 18 million people to enter from outside the country with hardly any of them undergoing health screenings or being put into quarantine.

Labour MP Stephen Doughty noted that “The fact that many of these people then likely arrived and travelled onwards across the UK with little or no adherence to social distancing, and with no checks or protections at the border is deeply disturbing.”

The UK has seen 100,000 people arriving from foreign countries at UK airports every single week, all with virtually no health checks whatsoever.

The ongoing coronavirus outbreak is sending cascading waves of fear across the entire Prosperity Gospel movement, as the specter of unemployed followers who will not be able to sustain these Charismatic phonies in their luxury lifestyles is much too painful a prospect for them to contemplate. Yesterday we showed you end times heretic and gospel pimp Paula White begging for you to ‘sow a Psalm 91 seed‘ of $91 dollars for her phony coronavirus hospital for the ‘spiritually sick’.

“Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.” Jude 1:11-13 (KJB)

Today we bring you Old Demon Eyes himself, Kenneth Copeland, and be forewarned, he is really, really mad at unemployed, coronavirus quarantined Christians. Just when I think that Laodicean crooks like Kenneth Copeland, Paula White and all the others cannot possibly get any lower or more disgusting, they do. But Kenneth Copeland, as you will see in this video, is in a class all by himself when it comes to sleaze.

Fear of this coronavirus is faith in its ability to hurt you or kill you. The fear of ‘What are we gonna do? I’m getting laid off at work!’ Hey! Your job’s not your source. If it is, you’re in trouble. Jesus is your source! Whatever you do right now, don’t you stop tithing! Don’t you stop sowing offerings. ‘Well, they won’t let us go to church!’ Well, email it in, then! Text together. Something. But you get your tithe in that church if you have to go take it down there and drop it off… stick it under the door or something. You get that tithe in that church, you get that offering in that church, and then you go home and do what you’re supposed to do.

That’s right. Kenneth Copeland is ordering his gullible followers to keep giving him money even if they lose their job in the coronavirus pandemic because Jesus.

I don’t think that Kenneth Copeland is a billionaire, though I am quite sure he has more money than he could ever spend in 10 lifetimes. But what an interesting video to see after watching him screaming at his unemployed coronavirus suffering followers to not stop ‘tithing’. Their greed knows no bounds, none at all. Shame on you, Kenneth Copeland.

Earlier this month the televangelist made headlines after claiming that he could cure viewers of the coronavirus if they touched his oily hand through their television set during his televised ministry.

Dr. Gideon Polya notes in “An Iraqi Holocaust/ 2.7 Million Iraqi Dead From Violence Or War-imposed Deprivation” that the West’s supremely criminal war against Iraq alone

The West and its allies support al Qaeda and ISIS globally. They are the proxies, the “boots on the ground” that destroy sovereign, independent countries for their Western permanent-state masters. They are the essence of barbarism and evil, shrouded in torn veils of “plausible deniability” that deceive only those who willfully choose to be deceived.

Happily, the Axis of Resistance is becoming stronger. Each victory for those countries that oppose Western barbarism (including Yemen, Syria and Iraq) is a victory for nation-state sovereignty and territorial integrity, a victory for international law, a victory for dignity and civilization, a victory for truth, justice, peace, and a livable planet.

A multi-polar world order will impose restraints on the lunacy of the U.S-led New World Order, its global war, its predatory, anti-Life political economies, its poverty, and its growing holocaust. Stripped of its war propaganda, the US-led monster is a global dictatorship that extracts disproportionate wealth from the world to a minute, transnational oligarch class.

Syria, Iraq, Iran, Russia, China, Yemen are all on the front lines against the West’s cancerous foreign policies of normalized Supreme International war crimes, of criminal blockades, of widespread, genocidal mass-murder, and the on-going destruction of a livable planet.

The crimes and their consequences are pre-planned and monstrous. The West murdered almost 600,000 Iraqi children when it intentionally destroyed water plants in Iraq through economic blockades. They bombed water infrastructure in Libya and Syria, and they are using the same tactics in Yemen, as well. Civilian deaths are intended, planned for, they are mass murder. The predicted diseases, the cholera, are also anticipated. The UN itself has condemned the cholera epidemic in Yemen as a “man-made disaster.”

Journalist David Pear notes in “The US-Led Genocide and Destruction of Yemen”:

“Since 2015 the cholera epidemic has been spread by biological warfare against Yemen. US bombs dropped by Saudi pilots destroyed Yemen’s public water and sewage systems. The parts, chemicals and fuel to operate Yemen’s water purification and sewage plants are blockaded. Potable water, cholera vaccine, and even individual water purification tablets cannot get in …. The sewage from non-working treatment plants overflows into streams that run onto agricultural land, thus contaminating vegetables before they go to market. Sewage flows into the cities, residential areas and the refugee camps. Flies swarm over the sewage and spread cholera everywhere. The International Committee of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and Doctors Without Borders; hospitals, clinics and disaster relief organizations, and human rights workers have been deliberately bombed.”

Yemen, like its counterparts in the Resistance, seeks its own sovereign political economy, free from externally-imposed “neoliberal” diktats, the privatizations, the international financing and impoverishing “Structural Adjustment Programs”.

Yemen seeks to use its resources for the social uplift of its peoples, as guaranteed by the UN Charter and International law. Yemen seeks justice and truth and peace, as it fights the West’s al Qaeda terrorists, as it withstands the bombs furnished by the West, delivered by Saudi planes, commanded and controlled by the West. And Yemen is winning the war.

Shortly after the Aramco attacks, falsely blamed on Iran, Houthi forces defeated a large Saudi force in the Najran province, capturing 1000’s of soldiers, and littering the battlefield with light armored vehicles (LAVs) – manufactured by General Dynamics Lands Systems in London, Ontario, Canada.

In Phase Two of the offensive, Yemeni Armed Forces reportedly overtook three Saudi military bases and now control more than 150 square kilometers of Saudi territory.

These victories, as with Syria’s on-going victories over international terrorism, are ushering in a new era of multipolarity, an era that promises to be more resistant to the West’s terrorism, more resistant to the shackles of globalizing “neoliberal” parasitism, and more resistant to Washington’s unipolar agenda of permanent war and poverty – a cancerous agenda , toxic to humanity and toxic to a livable planet."

Over three decades later, “sleepy Joe” is caught doing the same thing, which proves the saying “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.”

The gaffe-prone politician is also famous for among other things, speaking off-the-cuff with ill-timed jokes, verbal blunders and embarrassing analogies, which throughout his long career have become synonyms with that’s “just Joe,” from both friend and foe alike.

However plagiarism and verbal missteps pale in comparison to “creepy Joe’s” wandering hands when it comes to females, and it makes little difference if they’re young or old, “creepy Joe” doesn’t discriminate, kissing, touching, grabbing, caressing, stroking, nuzzling them all, without any thought, consideration or instinct given, to invading their personal space.

This latest blunder is simply a continuation of Biden’s haphazard political career, which luckily for him received a bit of a reprieve as VP.

However, President Trump took notice from Europe and tweeted out Wednesday, that the former VP has a “big problem.”

Adding, “Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem, but the Corrupt Media will save him.”

The Republican National Committee also weighted in reminding Democratic voters of Biden’s past indiscretions, portraying him as a serial plagiarist.

“This is not Joe Biden’s first brush with plagiarism,” said the RNC’s Steve Guest. “During his 1988 campaign, Biden plagiarized campaign speeches from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock as well as Robert Kennedy. During law school, Biden plagiarized, too.”

The Biden camp attempted to clean up the mess saying that the former VP had made a mistake.

“Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document,” the campaign told news outlets. “As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.”

Moreover, Trump’s prediction that the media would cover for Biden has proven accurate as Politico writer Michael Grunwald attempted a clever spin on the facts tweeting, “We’re supposed to be mad at Biden because he copied a few lines of his climate plan from environmental groups?”

Conservatives fired back with claims that the media are letting Biden off the hook.

“Trying to imagine a conservative getting caught plagiarizing and having it characterized simply as ‘lifting language,’” tweeted Matt Whitlock, an adviser to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

The obvious similarities within the verbiage were first noticed by a progressive activist, it was apparent that Biden had lifted quite a bit of the original text without crediting either the author or the organization. However, by Tuesday afternoon the Biden team updated their online website to include attribution to a third party.

Josh Nelson, the vice president of CREDOmobile, addressed the alleged plagiarism by Biden earlier in the day tweeting, “The paragraph in Joe Biden’s climate plan about carbon capture and sequestration includes language that is remarkably similar to items published previously by the Blue Green Alliance and the Carbon Capture Coalition.”

Nelson posted two examples of the Biden camp “borrowing” language from left-wing groups which once again points to Biden’s credibility as a viable candidate for 2020.

The former VP aside from his many personal missteps, may also be looking at potential violations while VP during the Obama Administration involving his son’s questionable dealings with both China and the Ukraine, and Biden’s attempt as VP to perhaps block a criminal investigation by holding as ransom a 1.8 billion dollar aid package for the Ukraine — unless prosecutors looked the other way."

Emmanuel Macron, preparing to assume power as the global leader in the international Covid-19 Plannedemic, received the fervent support of Pope Francis during a telephone exchange today in Paris.

Just yesterday we brought you the story of how French president Emmanuel Macron had shored up an alliance with the UN Security Council to take the reins of power in the burgeoning New World Order, no small feat that. That was the first shoe. Today, the second shoe drops as it’s revealed that Emmanuel Macron had phone meeting with Pope Francis, where he received his ‘blessing’ and full support to reset the global economy.

We told you about the curious nature of that devil Judas Iscariot the son of perdition, and the man who will yet take the stage as Antichrist. In a recent bible study, we showed you how Satan wants what God has, which is why we see in Luke, Antichrist coming against Jerusalem, the City of God. We also showed you how Judas hung himself, not in despair, but in sheer mockery and contempt of what Jesus would do on the cross 12 hours later. Knowing that, wouldn’t it be just like Satan to have his Antichrist named Emmanuel, meaning ‘God with ‘, as yet another shot at the Almighty he so passionately hates?

What does Pope Francis call himself? He calls himself ‘holy father‘, a title stolen from God in John 17. So let’s put all the cards on the table now, shall we?

“And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.” John 17:11 (KJB)

We have the False Prophet Pope Francis, operating with under a name stolen from God, giving his sulphuric blessing to Antichrist wannabe Emmanuel Macron, whose name literally means ‘God with us’.

Everyone of these end times villains are looking for all the world like they’re in training for the Revelation 13 Olympics.

Looking like 18 months, people, 18 months. Remember that.

What happened with Pope Francis and Emmanuel Macron today will make so much more sense to you after reading this article on Judas. The pope and Macron have a long, long history together, you should read about that as well. Now for today’s stunning article on the end times coven.

Pope Francis Anoints Emmanuel Macron To Take The Reins Of The New World Order

FROM BFM TV: Emmanuel Macron and Pope Francis exchanged on the coronavirus crisis with “a lot of convergence” on the responses to be made, especially on the reduction of the debt of the poorest countries , said the Elysee on Tuesday.

During a 45-minute call in Spanish and French, the pope “welcomed the constructive initiatives” taken by France internationally since the start of the health crisis, according to the presidency.

“THERE IS A LOT OF CONVERGENCE IN THE VISION AND THE ANSWERS” ON “THE DEBT OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES”, “AID TO AFRICA”, THE NEED FOR “A TRUCE AND A HUMANITARIAN PAUSE IN THE CONFLICTS “AND” THE NEED FOR A UNITED AND UNITED EUROPE “, SAID THE ELYSÉE.

In his Easter message on April 12, Pope Francis had proposed “to reduce” or even “cancel” the debt of poor countries, a request that joins that of Emmanuel Macron to cancel the debt of African countries for their allow a better fight against the crisis.

THIS WAS THE THIRD TIME THAT POPE FRANCIS AND PRESIDENT MACRON HAVE SPOKEN. THEY FIRST MET ON JUNE 26, 2018, AND THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO MEN SEEMED TO BE PARTICULARLY GOOD AS THEY SPOKE TOGETHER FOR 57 MINUTES. IT WAS THE LONGEST MEETING BETWEEN THE POPE AND A HEAD OF STATE SINCE FRANCIS MET WITH U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IN 2014. THEY SPOKE TOGETHER A SECOND TIME BY PHONE IN MAY 2019 AFTER THE FIRE AT NOTRE-DAME CATHEDRAL IN PARIS. READ MORE

The pope also expressed to the French president his “support” in the “ordeal crossed” by France, where the coronavirus left more than 20,000 dead, according to the Elysée.

This interview, requested by Paris, was the third between the two leaders after a visit by Emmanuel Macron to the Vatican in June 2018 and a telephone discussion in May 2019 following the fire of Notre-Dame de Paris. READ MORE"

Please consider Turkey’s Erdogan Warns Muslims Against Birth Control.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on Muslims to reject contraception and have more children.

In a speech broadcast live on TV, he said “no Muslim family” should consider birth control or family planning.

“We will multiply our descendants,” said Mr Erdogan, who became president in August 2014 after serving as prime minister for 12 years.

In Monday’s speech in Istanbul, the Turkish leader placed the onus on women, particularly on “well-educated future mothers”, to not use birth control and to ensure the continued growth of Turkey’s population.

Mr Erdogan himself is a father of four. He has previously spoken out against contraception, describing it as “treason” when speaking at a wedding ceremony in 2014.

He has also urged women to have at least three children, and has said women cannot be treated as equal to men.

Turkey’s fertility rate is one of the highest in Europe and the country’s relatively young population (compared with other European countries) is still growing. The population is just under 80 million."

Southern Baptists took their first steps towards their eventual acceptance of same-sex marriage by meeting with members of the LGBT community at the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission 2014 Conference in Nashville. While neither side relinquished their position, most in attendance agreed that a shift had indeed taken place.

“Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.” 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 (KJV)

NASHVILLE, Tenn.—A gathering of Southern Baptists here opened this week with Albert Mohler, stalwart head of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, apologizing for “denying the reality of sexual orientation,” but saying orientation “can change.”

It closed with a pastor saying “no one goes to hell for being homosexual,” but he added Christians must remind gay friends and family members that “the day of judgment is coming.”

The statements from the largest and one of the most conservative Protestant denominations made waves in the religious and gay communities. Some praised the Southern Baptist Convention for softening its tone and message when discussing homosexuals. Critics complained that nothing really had changed.

But others who attended said a shift was taking place. In private meetings and one-on-one encounters during the week, Southern Baptists and gay-rights advocates said they established relationships they hope will carry both sides through a time of deep cultural change, particularly as the church navigates issues such as the increasing acceptance of same-sex marriage.

Mr. Mohler this week met with Matthew Vines, an openly gay Christian author who argues the Bible doesn’t prohibit lifelong same-sex marriage. Mr. Mohler wrote a response to Mr. Vines’ book, “God and the Gay Christian.”

“It was a gracious, honest conversation. I think all evangelical Christians are having to learn anew how to discuss these issues,” Mr. Mohler said.

The pair agreed to keep in touch over email, and alert each other if one ever felt wrongly portrayed by the other.

“This was an amazing event,” said Mr. Vines. “Not for the public sessions but for the private meetings. It’s not like anyone is suddenly pro-gay,” said Mr. Vines. But, he added, “it feels like a new era.”"

Back on March 15, 2020, The Gateway Pundit reported on the coronavirus death rates in Italy.

The Italian government released numbers on the coronavirus in mid March.

 There were 1,809 new cases of the deadly disease reported in Italy at the time.

The Italian government also released the percentage of deaths by age group.

90+ years old: 6% of deaths

 80 – 89 years old: 42% of deaths

 70 – 79 years old: 35% of deaths

 60 – 69 years old: 16% of deaths

99% of the coronavirus deaths in Italy were people 60-years-old and older.

 And according to the BBC the the AVERAGE AGE of those who have died is 81!

We are seeing similar results in country after country — despite the media hysterics and lies.

Phil Kerpen pointed to similar numbers in Pennsylvania where there are more coronavirus deaths OVER age 100 than UNDER age 45.

And in the UK there are more coronavirus deaths over age 90 than under age 64!

These are startling numbers that reveal the so-called experts were wrong on almost everything and destroyed the global economy due to their corrupt predictions.

Former CIA director says he's willing to talk with investigators

Former CIA Director John Brennan responded to the impending John Durham investigation, saying he is willing to talk with investigators because he has ""nothing to hide.""

During an interview on MSNBC’s “All In,” Brennan claimed that President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr deceived the American people by mischaracterizing what has happened in the past.

“John Durham, who is a well-respected individual from the Department of Justice…is conducting this investigation, I guess this investigation, and looking at what happened during those last months of the Obama administration and the first year or two of the Trump administration,"" Brennan said.

""I’d like to think that John Durham and the other DOJ and FBI investigators will continue to honor their oath of office and to carry out their responsibilities without any consideration of [the] political interests of Donald Trump,"" he added.

""And so, I feel very good that my tenure at CIA and my time at the White House during the Obama administration was not — that I was not engaged in any type of wrongdoing or activities that cause me to worry about what this investigation may uncover,"" Brennan continued.

""So, I welcome the opportunity to talk with the investigators. I have nothing to hide.""

""I have not yet been interviewed by any of those individuals involved in this matter, but I’m willing to do so,"" he added.

""Because I do believe that, for too long, the American public [has] been misled by Donald Trump, by William Barr, and others,"" he argued.

""And so, I look forward to the day when the truth is going to come out, and the individuals who have mischaracterized what has happened in the past will be shown to have deceived the American people.”

Last week, Attorney General William Barr revealed Durham's investigation uncovered evidence ""far more troubling"" than what could be explained away as ""mistakes or sloppiness.""

“My own view is that the evidence shows that we’re not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness,” Barr said.

""There is something far more troubling here, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it.""

John Durham has since drafted in additional prosecutors in his review of the origins of the investigation into the alleged Russia-Trump coordination in 2016.

 In this exciting episode Dark Journalist Daniel Liszt welcomes back Chemtrails Expert Elana Freeland. Her classic book, Chemtrails HAARP & The Full Spectrum Dominance of Planet Earth, is the definitive book on these suppressed subjects. Her new book, Under An Ionized Sky: Chemtrails & Space Fence Lockdown, is the first major in-depth examination of the murky covert program that has been under development since the 1980s under the Reagan Administration where it was a major aspect of the SDI Star Wars Program. 



 Roots of the Space Fence: SDI Star Wars

 When President Reagan announced that the US would be pouring vast resources into a major weaponization of Space with what he called the 'Strategic Defense Initiative' or 'Star Wars' it was widely assumed that it was meant as a missile shield program to deflect Nuclear Missile Launches from Russia. It's true purpose may have had just as much to do with protecting the world from 'An Alien Threat' as Reagan suggested in a UN Speech, that would bring the world together to fight a common enemy.



 An Ionized Atmosphere: Space Fence Deployment

 When the Soviet Union Fell ion December 26th, 1991, it was widely assumed that the SDI program was abandoned along with this historical event. In fact it appears that all of the research around Star Wars was reintegrated into a covert initiative for building a Space Fence that would serve as a Major Global Surveillance and Control Grid. What was missing in the 1980s to realize this vision, came along in the 1990s with the development HAARP and the successful efforts to Ionize the Atmosphere. With this being achieved over the last two decades, the conditions are perfect for the full deployment of The Space Fence and all of its terrifying implications of worldwide dominance over communications and a new paradigm of Space being Weaponized.

If you don’t have a box of tissues nearby, you might want to grab one before reading any further.

A little over two years ago, former UFC fighter Nick “The Jersey Devil” Catone suffered the loss of his precious son, Nicholas Jr., who died after being injected with the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella.

Catone recently mourned the second anniversary of his son’s death on Facebook, explaining to his friends and followers what happened to young Nicholas as a result of going along with the government’s recommended vaccination schedule – which ultimately killed his innocent son.

On January 10, 2017, Catone brought young Nicholas in to see the family’s pediatrician for a “Well Visit,” during which the infant was given both the MMR vaccine and the Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B) vaccine. The very next day, young Nicholas went from being a happy, smiling little boy to a clearly vaccine-damaged victim of Big Pharma corruption – and he died not long after that.

Photos shared by Catone show Nicholas in his healthy state prior to getting vaccinated, as well as post-vaccine photos in which young Nicholas appears confused, traumatized, and what Infowars.com writer Adan Salazar describes as a countenance indicative of “neurological trauma.”

Catone directed his Facebook post to young Nicholas directly, expressing sorrow and remorse over his decision to have his son vaccinated.

“Wish i knew what i know now and we were able to put it all together,” Catone wrote.

“I’m so sorry Nicholas. I just broke down going through these pictures and typing this. Makes me sick that you are gone. Still can’t believe this happened to our family. Worst possible thing in the world. It’s so hard. I’ll never stop fighting for you. I love you more than you could ever imagine Nicholas. Heartbroken forever without you. I miss you, Nicholas goodnight up in heaven.”

The very next day, Catone shared another post on Facebook that presented factual data showing that vaccines aren’t safe, and that they do cause autism. He linked to an article written by Ty Bollinger from The Truth About Cancer entitled, “Vaccines and Autism: Expert Exposes DOJ Vaccine Fraud,” that delineates this point.

“My son should be here,” Catone wrote in his Facebook post, published on January 11. “Healthy 20 months olds just don’t pass away,” he added, explaining that the vaccine agenda is based on lies and deception.

In order to help other parents avoid making the same mistake he did, Catone wants the world to know that vaccines cause autism – and more importantly, that vaccines kill.

“Wake up people,” he warned. “Don’t let it happen to you. It’s disgusting what’s going on. So much corruption and lies. All they care about is money. These are our children we are talking about. Makes me sick.”

Meanwhile, Fox News is keeping busy pushing the pro-vaccine agenda. As we recently reported, the cable news network’s “Medical Correspondent,” Dr. Marc Siegel, openly stated during a segment that aired on January 28 that doctors who sign off on exemption forms for parents to opt out of “mandatory” vaccinations should be “prosecuted” for exercising their right to health freedom.

“It is one of the greatest inventions in the history of public health,” Dr. Siegel disgustingly screamed on Fox, referring to the very same MMR vaccine that killed young Nicholas Catone.

You do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure this out.” Mannarino goes on to explain, “Cash will leave the debt market, and that will push yields higher. That will put pressure in equities. This is a reverse of what we see now in inflating this super bubble here. There is a super bubble in debt. There is a super bubble in stocks. When all this cash starts to move, it is going to look for a place to go, and it is going to move into commodities. As this is occurring, all these bills digital or otherwise, that are around the world . . . when people see the value of currency start to drop precipitously, they are going to come back here to the United States. Massive amount of bills are going to chase the same amount of goods and whamo–there’s your inflation.”

Last week, Mannarino said the stock market had topped, and it has nowhere to go but down. Why? Mannarino says Dow Transports need to be rising in order to sustain a rising stock market. With all the gains of 2015 now wiped out, Mannarino says, “You would expect the Dow Transports to be rising with the equity markets or stock market. We are not seeing that at all. There is an absolute disconnect here. . . . The Dow Transports have begun a clear leg down, and unless something dramatic happens to bring the Transports back up, this bull market is over.”

On the recent run up in 10-year Treasury yields, Mannarino says, “This is the free market just trying to determine fair market value. When this comes down, forget about it. There is going to be a moment when all assets will correct.”

The correction is going to be painful and deep because Mannarino contends, “What we have here is an environment involving the most gargantuan bubble that has ever been seen in the history of the world. What we know about bubbles is this, every single one without exception bursts. They burst because they rise above a level that can be sustained by any means. That means despite whatever the central banks are going to try to do to keep this whole thing pushed up, it will be the free market that will dictate fair market value. That is going to be that epic snap back where all assets across the board, debt, currency, metal and stocks, correct to fair market value. It is going to shake the core of the earth when that happens. It is going to be nothing but a wealth transfer. People who have exposure to this market on the long end, 401k’s and retirement funds, their wealth is going to be transferred from their pockets to another group of people.”

How has Wall Street kept the game going on so long? Mannarino says, “The corruption is so extreme with metal manipulation, currency manipulation and banks that continue to be brought up on charges, and no one goes to jail. . . . It’s unbelievable fraud to such an extreme it is frightening. The entire system is built on trust that the system will work, and the banks are well aware of this and are exploiting it. This is why no bankers are brought up on charges. This is why no one gets handcuffed and no one gets arrested because it would shake the very foundation of the financial system. It is built simply on a trust mechanism. So, the bankers can rig everything, and they are, and they will not get in trouble for it.”

In closing, Mannarino says, “We are at a tipping point. There is no doubt about it.”

There are no vaccine mandates in Japan and their children are growing up healthier than ours.

Officials in California are desperately trying to take away the rights of their residents by seeking to override medical opinion about whether or not a person is fit for vaccination, while politicians in New York are mandating the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for 6-12-month-old infants even though that vaccine’s safety and effectiveness “has not been established.” (Link to Merck’s website – the creator of the MMR vaccine,) By Merck’s own admission, this vaccine is probably not safe, especially for infants.

Care to purposely give your 3-to-4-month-young baby gastrointestinal illness and upper-respiratory distress? Up your chances of sickening your child with these serious health crises by 40 – 60 percent, simply by getting a nurse or doctor to inject the so-called “safe and effective” MMR vaccine. Yes, the Measles, Mumps & Rubella shot, or choose any of them separate too, and the results are virtually the same. This is according to the FDA and a vaccine trial run on American kids. A shockingly high percentage of the children tested suffered extreme illnesses just days and weeks after receiving the same vaccine New York’s Governor (Bill “Adolf” de Blasio) wants to utilize in order to force-vaccinate all the Orthodox Jews (who all know better and opt out using religious exemptions). The insidious CDC has been fully exposed only thanks to an FOIA request (Freedom of Information Act), and now the MMR may be considered the 3rd most dangerous vaccine known to mankind, running close behind the deadly HPV vaccine and the infamously defective and mercury-laden flu jab (influenza vaccine). –Natural News

Instead of using force to vaccinate, perhaps scientists and doctors should take a quick look at what’s been going on in Japan. With a population of 127 million, Japan has the healthiest children and the very highest “healthy life expectancy” in the world. The country also boasts the least vaccinated children of any developed country. Now let’s compare the good ole USSA. The U.S. has the very highest infant mortality rate of all industrialized countries. More American children are dying at birth and in their first year of life than in any other comparable nation. Oh, and more than half of those children who do survive, develop at least one chronic illness, reported the Children’s Health Defense.

The U.S. government, in bed with Big Pharma, is sacrificing our children for profit. What you won’t hear from vaccine advocates or the mainstream media, is that Merck is in court over MMR-related fraud. Whistleblowers have alleged that the pharmaceutical giant rigged its efficacy data for the vaccine’s mumps component to ensure its continued market monopoly. The evidence has given rise to two separate court cases. In addition, a CDC whistleblower has alleged the MMR vaccine increases autism risksin some children. Others have reported that the potential risk of permanent injury from the MMR vaccine dwarfs the risks of getting measles.

All of these risks involved with getting vaccinated are being covered up by government agencies (FDA and CDC) and the politicians simply don’t care. The vaccine industry is for profit and until safety and saving lives is more important than money, the government and Big Pharma will continue to sacrifice our children to line their own pockets."

Now that World Wide Web founder Tim Berners-Lee has announced a new “Contract for the Web” that he says will serve as “a road map to build a better web,” many are asking themselves: What’s to become of online free speech as we enter the year 2020?

Even though Berners-Lee insists that his Contract for the Web is about upholding “digital rights,” the tech giants that are onboard with it, including Google and Facebook, are doing the exact opposite by restricting the First Amendment rights of people online, and even calling free speech “disastrous.”

How, then, is Big Tech now claiming to support Berners-Lee’s vision of fostering a “healthy conversation online?” The answer is simple: “Digital rights” and “free speech” only apply to certain subjects, topics, and perspectives, while all others are off-limits.

As long as you’re in agreement with Google and Facebook about vaccines being “safe and effective,” as one example, then you’re free to post as much “free speech” on their platforms as you’d like. But if you point out the fact that vaccines contain the entire gene sequences of aborted human babies, then you suddenly no longer have any free speech.

The same applies to the Cult of LGBTQ. If you express any opposition on Facebook to Drag Queen Story Hour events and the transgender indoctrination of children, then your “free speech” suddenly becomes hate speech, meaning it’s no longer allowed and could even cost you your career.

The tech cabal is leading the United States right into tyrannical communism by eliminating free speech and dubbing all opposing viewpoints as “hate speech”

Just like communist China with its “social credit score” scheme, American tech giants like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and many others are actively surveilling the content that’s shared through their platforms in order to assign users varying degrees of “free speech rights” depending on their viewpoints.

If you’re someone whose perspectives closely align with those of the deep state, then you’re given free-reign to post and share whatever you’d like. But if you even dare to mention the word “geoengineering” on your page or profile, then you could be tagged as a “conspiracy theorist” whose content needs to be shadow-banned or otherwise censored for “wrongspeak.”

Pointing out that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are largely untested and completely unnecessary is another punishable offense on social media, as is drawing attention to the fact that pharmaceuticals are dangerous and often inferior to their natural, unpatented counterparts.

Unless you’re someone who believes that all vaccines are safe and effective; that fluoride in drinking water is good for the human body; that GMOs are awesome and the solution to “climate change;” that some men have periods and some women have penises; and that Hillary Clinton should have been president and Donald Trump should be impeached, then you won’t be afforded the same “free speech” rights as those who believe all of these things to be undeniable facts.

Hollywood actor Rob Schneider got it right when he tweeted that true free speech includes all free speech – “[e]ven the speech that you find repugnant,” he wrote unequivocally.

“We don’t need people deciding FOR us what to think, see or hear. That’s a load of totalitarian crap,” he further wrote, emphasizing precisely what our Founding Fathers would be saying were they alive today.

543,False,There is no indication of a conspiracy theory in this article.,True,"The article mentions doctors, the New York Department of Health, and the World Health Organization as actors involved in investigating and treating the illness.",True,"The article mentions that children are being hospitalized and treated for symptoms, and health officials are probing the cases to identify any link to the Wuhan coronavirus.",True,The article mentions that children are being hospitalized and some require intensive care for cardiac or respiratory support.,False,There is no indication of a pattern being discussed in this article.,False,There is no indication of secrecy in this article.,"More than a dozen young people in New York City are having to be hospitalized after they reportedly came down with a “mysterious” new syndrome that some media outlets speculate might be related to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

A total of 15 children were treated for symptoms including inflammation of the blood vessels, along with vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Doctors say they do not know the cause, though there are “concerns, not yet substantiated,” that it might be linked to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

All of the children are between the ages of two and 15, and more than seven of them require blood pressure support. And five of these are said to be needing mechanical ventilation as part of their treatment.

These mysterious illnesses follow reports by the New York Department of Health (NYDH) that another 100 children, mostly in European countries, have also had to be treated at hospitals for similar symptoms.

Inflamed blood vessels could be suggestive of Kawasaki disease, a rare illness that strikes one in 10,000 children under the age of five every year. Other symptoms of Kawasaki disease include swollen hands and feet, bright red lips that are also swollen, and rashes on the torso or groin.

In its report, the NYDH advised city doctors to keep an eye out for a condition currently being described as “multi-system inflammatory syndrome,” which often necessitates having to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiac or respiratory support. So far, no children have died from whatever this is.

Speaking of deaths, listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how people who take pharmaceutical drugs and get vaccinated are far more likely than people who live natural lives to die from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19):

There is no proof that this new syndrome is linked to coronavirus

Though some suspect that this mystery disease might be related to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), seeing as how it is already going around, media reports are clear in emphasizing that the two are not definitively linked. Even so, the World Health Organization (WHO) is urging its clinical network to be aware of any new cases that might emerge.

Keep in mind that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is infecting very few children as it is. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only about 1.7 percent of known cases are in children, and the vast majority of these have been mild.

With that said, whatever this new syndrome is that is afflicting children could potentially be some kind of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) mutation, though, again, that is all speculation at this point.

The reason why some believe that there might be a connection to Kawasaki syndrome is that, even though it is rare, the disease tends to be triggered by the presence of viruses or infections. In other words, there is a possibility that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is “awakening” Kawasaki syndrome in some children.

“Kawasaki syndrome does not have a precise cause, but in genetically predisposed children there is a triggering environmental factor, probably infectious and probably viral,” says pediatrician Dr. Marianna Fabi, who is currently treating five cases of the disease at Bologna’s Sant’Orsola-Malpighi hospital in Italy.

Meanwhile, New York City health officials are probing the known cases there to see if they can identify any link to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). According to health commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot, “even though the relationship of this syndrome to COVID-19 is not yet defined, and not all of these cases have tested positive for COVID-19 by either DNA test or serology, the clinical nature of this virus is such that we are asking all providers to contact us immediately if they see patients who meet the criteria we’ve outlined.”"

Moore explained how fear and guilt are leveraged by proponents of climate change:

Fear has been used all through history to gain control of people’s minds and wallets and all else, and the climate catastrophe is strictly a fear campaign — well, fear and guilt — you’re afraid you’re killing your children because you’re driving them in your SUV and emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and you feel guilty for doing that. There’s no stronger motivation than those two.

Scientists are co-opted and corrupted by politicians and bureaucracies invested in advancing the narrative of “climate change” in order to further centralize political power and control, explained Moore.

Moore noted how “green” companies parasitize taxpayers via favorable regulations and subsidies ostensibly justified by the aforementioned narrative’s claimed threats, all while enjoying propagandistic protection across news media”

And so you’ve got the green movement creating stories that instill fear in the public. You’ve got the media echo chamber — fake news — repeating it over and over and over again to everybody that they’re killing their children. And then you’ve got the green politicians who are buying scientists with government money to produce fear for them in the form of scientific-looking materials. And then you’ve got the green businesses, the rent-seekers, and the crony capitalists who are taking advantage of massive subsidies, huge tax write-offs, and government mandates requiring their technologies to make a fortune on this. And then, of course, you’ve got the scientists who are willingly, they’re basically hooked on government grants. When they talk about the 99 percent consensus [among scientists] on climate change, that’s a completely ridiculous and false number. But most of the scientists — put it in quotes, scientists — who are pushing this catastrophic theory are getting paid by public money, they are not being paid by General Electric or Dupont or 3M to do this research, where private companies expect to get something useful from their research that might produce a better product and make them a profit in the end because people want it — build a better mousetrap type of idea. But most of what these so-called scientists are doing is simply producing more fear so that politicians can use it to control people’s minds and get their votes because some of the people are convinced, ‘Oh, this politician can save my kid from certain doom.’

The narrative of anthropogenic global warming or “climate change” is an existential threat to reason, warned Moore:

It is the biggest lie since people thought the Earth was at the center of the universe. This is Galileo-type stuff. If you remember, Galileo discovered that the sun was at the center of the solar system and the Earth revolved around it. He was sentenced to death by the Catholic Church, and only because he recanted was he allowed to live in house arrest for the rest of his life. So this was around the beginning of what we call the Enlightenment, when science became the way in which we gained knowledge instead of using superstition and instead of using invisible demons and whatever else, we started to understand that you have to have observation of actual events and then you have to repeat those observations over and over again, and that is basically the scientific method.

“But this abomination that is occurring today in the climate issue is the biggest threat to the Enlightenment that has occurred since Galileo,” declared Moore. “Nothing else comes close to it. This is as bad a thing that has happened o science in the history of science.”

Moore concluded, “It’s taking over science with superstition and a kind of toxic combination of religion and political ideology. There is no truth to this. It is a complete hoax and scam.”

Trump is trying to balance the scale between the U.S. and China by pushing $250 billion in deals.

The Senate version of a tax cut is out, and it’s basically a complicated scam that won’t cut taxes at all for many, especially in the top brackets. Trump pushed for simplicity, and the new Senate tax bill is 450 pages long. I wonder if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is really just covertly trying to make things so complicated and onerous to sabotage Donald Trump’s mandate given to him in the 2016 election.

But even the Associated Press (AP) says Democrats are distorting the Trump administration’s coronovirus readiness.

Democratic presidential contenders are describing the federal infectious-disease bureaucracy as rudderless and ill-prepared for the coronavirus threat because of budget cuts and ham-handed leadership by President Donald Trump. That’s a distorted picture. For starters, Trump hasn’t succeeded in cutting the budget.

He’s proposed cuts but Congress ignored him and increased financing instead. The National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aren’t suffering from budget cuts that never took effect.

A look at some of the Democrats’ remarks:

MIKE BLOOMBERG: “There’s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And he’s defunded — he’s defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don’t have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing.” — debate Tuesday night.

JOE BIDEN, comparing the Obama-Biden administration with now: “We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. … He’s wiped all that out. … He cut the funding for the entire effort.”

THE FACTS: They’re both wrong to say the agencies have seen their money cut. Bloomberg is repeating the false allegation in a new ad that states the U.S. is unprepared for the virus because of “reckless cuts” to the CDC. Trump’s budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there’s strong bipartisan support for agencies such as the CDC and NIH. Instead, financing has increased.

Indeed, the money that government disease detectives first tapped to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional fund created for health emergencies.

Some public health experts say a bigger concern than White House budgets is the steady erosion of a CDC grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness — the front lines in detecting and battling new disease. But that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates Trump.

The broader point about there being “nobody here” to coordinate the response sells short what’s in place to handle an outbreak.

The public health system has a playbook to follow for pandemic preparation — regardless of who’s president or whether specific instructions are coming from the White House. Those plans were put into place in anticipation of another flu pandemic, but are designed to work for any respiratory-borne disease.

Among the health authorities overseeing the work are Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC’s principal deputy director and a veteran of previous outbreaks, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIH’s infectious disease chief who has advised six presidents.

“The CDC’s response has been excellent, as it has been in the past,” said John Auerbach, president of the nonpartisan Trust for America’s Health, which works with government at all levels to improve the nation’s response to high-risk health crises. Some Democrats have charged that Trump decimated the nation’s public health leadership, but Auerbach said CDC’s top scientific ranks have remained stable during the past three years….

The U.S. closed borders to travelers from China to buy time as preparations began but, “classically that’s not the way you address an outbreak,” Fauci told The Associated Press this week. “If you do it for a very limited period of time, temporarily until you can get things in order in your own country, it could have some benefit. But in general, the concept of closing borders, you cannot do that for an extended period of time.”

But with infections now in much of the world, one of the questions for U.S. policymakers is whether it’s time to modify any of those border or travel restrictions."

The group of 40 scientists were onboard the CCGS Amundsen, a ship known for its icebreaking capabilities, but this time the ice proved too thick for the ship to break through safely.

“Their trip began May 25 in Quebec City, but due to bad ice conditions off the coast of Newfoundland, the icebreaker was diverted from its course to help ferries and fishing boats navigate the Strait of Belle Isle, said David Barber, a climate change scientist at the University of Manitoba and leader of the Hudson Bay expedition called BaySys,” reported CBC News. “Thick, dense ice had travelled to the area down from the High Arctic, said Barber, which caused unsuspecting boats to become stuck and even take on water.”

Barber, of course, claimed “man-made climate change” reduced the thickness of the ice, causing it to float southward, yet the Environment and Climate Change Canada seems to have unintentionally contradicted this claim.

“Typically there would be very little or no ice left in either of these areas at this time of year, let alone the thick ice pack we are currently seeing off the northeast coast of Newfoundland,” a spokesperson for the agency stated, with emphasis added.

If the ice was thick enough to stop a ship designed to break through ice, then how could it be thin enough – and mobile enough – to make it that far south?

Something doesn’t sound right here, but that isn’t too surprising given it’s typically politicians and government-funded scientists who are pushing the whole “climate change” narrative as part of a globalist agenda to control a nation’s energy output and thus its economy.

The globalists don’t want independent nation-states with strong economies; they want unelected, super-regional governments like the EU consisting of member-states that are subordinate to the globalist-controlled economy driven by multinational banks and other unelected global bodies.

And that’s why the globalists are pushing “man-made climate change:” it gives them the “justification” to push “carbon currencies” which artificially cap the economic output of a nation.

Case in point, the Paris climate accord President Trump backed the US out of was designed to weaken the US economy while giving unfair advantages to India and China.

As researcher Patrick Wood noted in his book Technocracy Rising:

“Forces are already at work to position a new carbon currency as the ‘ultimate solution’ to global calls for poverty reduction, population control, environmental control, global warming, energy allocation and blank distribution of economic wealth. Unfortunately for individual people living in this new system, it will also require authoritarian and centralized control over all aspects of life, from cradle to grave.”

To sum it up, the globalists harp the dangers of “man-made climate change” (which they renamed from “global warming” once the data didn’t fit their agenda) to push for “carbon taxes” and “carbon currencies” that allow them to subjugate the US by impoverishing Americans through a new, technocratic form of colonialism.

“A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled.”

This is a fascinating quote because it explains the motivations behind both “carbon currencies” and open borders.

“Carbon currencies” keep the population so poor that they’ll never effectively rebel against the globalists, but even if they could, they can’t because they are now a scattered minority in their own homelands taken over by welfare-dependent migrants who will never question authority.

And then there’s Mooch’s package again swinging in his white camisole jumpsuit as he bounces down the stairs of daughter Malia’s Harvard University dorm on August 22, 2017. See “Michelle Obama is a man: See the junk moving in his pants“.

It runs in the family: Half-brother Malik Obama himself is something of a fraud. See “Tax-exempt charity of Obama’s half-brother is a fraud“.

An explosive article written by two close associates of Pope Francis has accused Steve Bannon, the chief White House strategist, of espousing an “apocalyptic geopolitics” whose roots are “not too far apart” from that of Islamist extremism.

The article in La Civiltà Cattolica, which is vetted by the Vatican before publication, lays out a scathing critique of “evangelical fundamentalism” in the US, arguing that, on issues ranging from climate change to “migrants and Muslims”, proponents of the ideology have adopted a twisted reading of scripture and the Old Testament that promotes conflict and war above all else.

The piece was published just days after evangelical leaders met US president Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House and “laid hands” on him in prayer following discussions about religious freedom, support for Israel and healthcare reform.

Trump has never convincingly spoken of having religious faith but won the overwhelming support of white evangelical Christians in the 2016 election.

Vatican experts said the article would have had the explicit backing of the church and Pope Francis. Its authors, Antonio Spadaro, the editor-in-chief of the publication, and Marcelo Figueroa, the editor-in-chief of the Argentinian edition of the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano, are known as confidantes of the Argentinian pope.

Bannon, the former editor of the Breitbart news website, is Catholic, and while he is only briefly mentioned in the article, the piece undoubtedly takes aim at the Trump White House.

It claims that fake religious arguments are being used to demonize segments of the population – particularly when it comes to migrants and Muslims – and to promote the US as a nation that is blessed by God, without ever taking into account the “bond between capital and profits and arms sales”.

“In this Manichaean vision [where the world is divided between good and evil], belligerence can acquire a theological justification and there are pastors who seek a biblical foundation for it, using scriptural texts out of context,” the authors write.

The article refers to the controversial evangelical theologist John Rushdoony as the father of today’s American Christian fundamentalism and calls Bannon an exponent of this philosophy.

“Rushdoony’s doctrine maintains a theocratic necessity: submit the state to the Bible with a logic that is no different from the one that inspires Islamic fundamentalism. At heart, the narrative of terror shapes the worldviews of jihadists and the new crusaders and is imbibed from wells that are not too far apart,” the authors state. “We must not forget that the geopolitics spread by Isis is based on the same cult of an apocalypse that needs to be brought about as soon as possible.”

In contrast, Pope Francis – with his emphasis on the need to build bridges, not walls, and his adamant refusal to conflate Islam and Islamic terrorism – is attempting to counter this narrative of “fear”, the article says.

One Catholic publication, Crux, called the article the “latest chapter in the tempestuous relationship between Francis and Trump”.

While the two leaders were seen as having a generally cordial – though somewhat joyless – meeting in May at the Vatican, the relationship suffered a significant setback following Trump’s decision to back out of the Paris climate accord just a week later. Argentinian Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, the head of the Vatican’s Academy of Sciences, called it a “slap in the face” to the Vatican.

Crux noted that La Civiltà Cattolica is reviewed by the Vatican’s secretary of state before publication and that Spadaro has been “considered one of the foremost vehicles for understanding the views of the current pontificate”.

The article says that Christian fundamentalism and Old Testament appeals to the apocalypse have shown themselves “not to be the product of a religious experience but a poor and abusive perversion of it”.

“This is why Francis is carrying forward a systematic counter-narration with respect to the narrative of fear. There is a need to fight against the manipulation of this season of anxiety and fear.”

It also criticizes conservative American Catholics who have aligned themselves with fundamentalist Protestants on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, saying that what really united the groups was a “nostalgic dream of a theocratic type of state”."

In 2002, Benjamin Netanyahu already harbored some extremely strong convictions on how to deal with both Iran and Iraq. Back then, his opinions on how to handle the particular challenges each presented were quite divergent. On the one hand, he suggested beaming “reruns of Melrose Place” into Tehran, as a way of inspiring a popular uprising. In contrast, he suggested such an approach could never work in Iraq, and instead advocated for his preferred solution: violence.

Naturally, he believed that a violent overthrow of Saddam Hussein would be a great thing. Specifically predicting that:

If you take out Saddam’s Regime, I guarantee you, that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.

Fast forward nearly thirteen years, and rather than recognizing that this man’s plan in Iraq only led to death, chaos, and the emergence of ISIS, Congress felt the need to ask him for advice once again. Since as we all know, being wrong in America doesn’t lead to consequences, it leads to promotions.

I call it the greatest crime of all time. One need only to believe ones own eyes, see the huge lines in the sky and do your own research to acknowledge why this argument is a strong argument to consider.

We decided to do a little research and make available a simple chemtrails-tracking webpage for tracking the globalist’s geoengineering crimes in Los Angeles for 30 (actually 31) days during the month of February- March 2013 and the results are in.

What can we learn from simple observations?

– We learned first that anyone can record their simple observations and these simple observations will usually tell a much greater story. We can state with a good degree of confidence that a longer observational study would yield more information about these spraying operations.

– Forecasts were changed in some cases one or two days prior to the day to apparently match whatever atmospheric chemical manipulations were going on that week.

– The news networks that put out the weather predictions not once bothered to address the sprayed chemical trails that altered the weather. The overall mass media-government silence on the issue was the most concerning.

– Spraying occurred with no particular pattern with regard to days of the week.

– Random people vary in terms of knowledge and awareness of these ongoing crimes against humanity but the actual spraying didn’t seem to arouse any alarm in the general public regardless of amount of spraying. Conversely, many in the general public are aware of these crimes but feel helpless to be able to do something about it.

– It was observed that the chemtrail terrorist pilots begin to spray all at once if and when working in teams; often either early in the morning or by 10-11 A.M. Once the first plane was seen to start spraying, then simultaneously other planes appeared at different parts of the sky flying at apparently the same altitudes also spraying in the same PATTERN as the other planes so as to create a parallel grid in the sky. The teamwork was clear and obvious every time.

– Conversely, when the chemtrail environmental terrorists took to the sky to do their assignment it was observed that all other planes in the sky (not involved in the parallel spraying) did NOT emit any contrails. In other words, at any given moment even though many planes are in the sky at one time (easily confirmed in flight tracking sites), only those one or two particular planes were seen spraying chemicals that alter the sky and the weather. Did someone not tell the other planes that they are supposed to be making contrails?

– Spraying was seen to coincide with abrupt temperature and weather changes, usually within a few days or sooner. For example, a long string of sunny warm days could be terminated with one massive day of spraying. Following the day of spraying, cooler, cloudy and sometimes rain will follow shortly.

What do you think?

Are YOU someone who has shut off the critical thinking portion of your brain and given in to Government Kool-Aid drinking conspiracy theorists who say that all the spraying is nothing more than contrails? Are you a blind believer in the ‘persistent contrails’ conspiracy claims made by paid government trolls and shills? Do you believe in the never-before-proven Government studies conducted in 2000 that were supposed to prove that normal planes can randomly emit a condensation trail that magically and inexplicably persists long enough to actually change the weather? Have you ever asked yourself why a government so deeply in debt would spend money to conduct an experiment to prove that persistent contrails are real when they could have used that money on other more important issues? Have you ever demanded to see the actual experiments that were done in these secret government studies? Do you know the difference between an ABSTRACT and an actual experimental study? Do you think that a claimed government Abstract IS the study itself?

Time to Reconsider Ask yourself, have you been knowingly or unknowingly siding with the powerful dark globalist forces on this environmental terror issue? Take time to think on your own and join us in exposing these crimes. Exposing these crimes starts with exposing those who want to defend the crime, which means anonymous bloggers who don’t want you to think on your own so they resort to CIA mind-control buzz words like “conspiracy theory”. Every time you hear that term it should draw a red flag in your mind to remind you that you are being manipulated by government propaganda mind control goons who need you to stay uninformed about the issue. As alluded to earlier, this simple observational prospective study was intended to show that any small effort of tracking these environmental crimes can be productive and can be used as a tool to increase awareness of the issue. I firmly believe this is the greatest overall crime of all time and I hope that some day justice will be served. Until then, please do what you can to protect and detoxify yourself from the ongoing exposure of metals we are subject to and do everything you can to expose these crimes by sharing this information, being pro-active and doing your own research.

I long ago declared that the food corporatocracy’s nutritional-food satellites such as the two ADAs (American Dietetic Association and the American Diabetes Association), the USDA, and the FDA are criminal organizations. The American Dietetic Association recently changed its name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND).

Michele Simon, president of Eat, Drink, Politics, a watchdog organization, has produced a useful 50-page report titled, And Now a Word from Our Sponsors: Are America’s Nutrition Professionals in the Pocket of Big Food? This is from her executive summary:

Against this backdrop, we must ask: what is the role of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND)—the nation’s largest association of nutrition professionals—in preventing or at least stemming the tide of diet-related health problems? What responsibility does this influential group of registered dietitians bear to be a leading advocate for policy changes to make eating healthfully more accessible? Does forming partnerships with the food industry compromise such a group’s credibility? And what does the food industry gain from such partnerships?

The report is another in a long chain of scathing indictments against the corrupt corporate state that has turned a mostly healthy populace into a sickly and obese society that has become disgustingly dependent on the pharmaceutical-psychiatric-medical machine that has long neglected unprofitable preventative care measures in favor of profitable standard medical protocols that address symptoms in the short term so as to make people patients for life.

You’ll note that Simon, in her study, points to her friend Marion Nestle, a writer and author and long-time antagonist of Big Food, and a dissector of all things food politics unless it indicts government as one of the culprits. Make no mistake – both Simon and Nestle are statists to the core. Neither of them have challenged how the Big Food corporate state became so omnipotent in the first place. The entire world of food politics in which they live, breathe, and swim is littered with the carcasses of government policy and dictocrat decrees. Still, they refuse to acknowledge the depth of the food politics for which they claim expertise, and they consistently maintain a position that their roles are to influence and change policy. Yes, policy = politics. They are self-declared politicians and they make a financial living off of politicking.

On page 23 of the report, Simon describes how the annual AND meeting was akin to a junk food industry showcase. Then she goes on to say the “positive” aspects of the annual meeting were the folks hawking “Meatless Mondays” and the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society is another corrupt satellite of the government-pharmaceutical-medical establishment, and its mother ship, Big Cancer, is another quasi-governmental machine that profits immensely off of keeping people sick and uninformed. Apparently, while carefully studying the AND’s long list of Big Food and pharmaceutical sponsors, Simon neglects to mention the similar sponsors of the American Cancer Society. Additionally, Meatless Monday is a statist concept with government-public health influence, and various local governments often try to ram this down the throat of their local constituency.

Near the end of the report (page 38), Simon backpedals and waxes poetically about personnel changes at the AND that are moving the organization along a path to change. She is setting the stage for the notion that the AND can revive its tarnished reputation (page 38). Statists like Simon are fond of revealing the evidence of gross misconduct and then ramping up an opposition cloaked in apparent principles, but always, they leave the door open for a future alliance and a potential consulting gig. This report has a lot of valid bark and recites much useful evidence, but there exists no bite whatsoever.

Due to the prodigious influence of Big Food and its cornucopia of marketing lies, the entire Registered Dietician profession is made up of legions of hypnotized automatons who have been reciting the standard, politicized text for decades, while their helpless victims – uneducated, sick people – have paid the price in terms of their lives, whether it be quality or quantity. Don’t expect the self-declared soldiers of food politics, like Simon and Nestle, to strike at the root of the problems anytime soon.

Rowland admits chemtrails are real, during a phone conversation. 



Dr. Rowland gives details about when it all started:



“It’s been done in the 1970s, it’s been done recently in the 1990s and 2000s.” And continues: “the lithium release in the daytime … hasn’t been done since the 1970s.”



OK, so lithium was only dispersed during the nighttime? Interesting…



Concerned Sue tries to get more from Dr. Rowland “Why would it be done now, sir? That’s scary!”, but he only offers his email address for further questions:

[email protected]



And after learning what lithium carbonate (not the same lithium used in chemtrails, or so they claim) can be used for, I have an impulse to send him an email myself.



“The lithium ion seems to alleviate mood disorders by affecting the way that brain cells respond to neurotransmitters.” [1]







So, the zombification of a nation is an actual NASA experiment?





In case you were wondering if Dr. Rowland can be linked to NASA, I have Google-searched his name and the connection is clear. He is a real scientist, employed by NASA.

Dr. Rowland works at “NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Heliophysicist – Laboratory for Space Weather” — which is probably the headquarter for chemtrails experiments… on us!

Also, very interesting to notice is the fact that Dr. Rowland calls them “chemtrails” himself, which is regarded by the main stream as a term for conspiracy theorists, and also acknowledges that chemtrails are of “different kinds”.

Recently, the UN tried to promote chemtrails as our only fighting chance against the global warming [2], so it’s clear that there will be no denying from now on. 







In an article from last year, I have presented official documents where the EU Parliament stressed that HAARP is a weather modification weapon [3] – among others.



So now that there’s no more hiding behind the bush, will the government finally admit that Chemtrails and HAARP can be used together for various purposes?

The damaging nature of microwaves was known about decades before mobile microwave technology was introduced. Only now are governments beginning to accept this.

The list of health problems that can arise due to exposure from microwaves is vast.

A much more effective weapon than an atomic bomb because it is almost impossible to trace them back to their source.

Their effects as weapons are varied ranging from causing cancers or heart attacks, mind control and a whole range of psychological and physiological effects. Microwave technology, according to Trower, is employed in satellites which can be used to effect the performance of individual Olympic athletes.

Before the first vote was cast, Sunday’s panel anointed Mitt Romney as the Republican candidate to face Barack Obama this fall. I really wonder why we have caucuses or primaries at all. We should all just watch TV and let shows like “Meet the Press” tell us what’s good for us. The word pompous comes to mind when I see them in action, and last night, Ron Paul showed them how little they know what America really wants by finishing just a few percentage points behing the Romney.

The MSM doesn’t tell reporters or guests what to say; they just pick the people who will say what they want. I heard only one relatively flattering thing about front runner Ron Paul during the entire discussion. Kathie Obradovich from the Des Moines Register said some of the caucus goers were “flocking” to Ron Paul because they were “desperate for real change,” and Congressman Paul was “completely different.” Other than that, every other word about Paul was negative. Why? Let’s face it, the left and right do not want real change and will try to taint or destroy anyone who brings it. They want the system of secret banker bailouts and Fed deals that rescue companies like General Electric from financial ruin which is part owner of NBC. (During the financial meltdown of 2008, GE was the sole owner of NBC and now has only a 49% share of the network.) They do not want prosecutions of Wall Street bankers for causing the financial meltdown with “liar loans” and “toxic” mortgage backed securities. Republicans and Democrats want what they have now and are just taking turns ripping off the country. The corporate owned MSM is just happy to take campain advertising money and are happy to cover the fake fighting.

You could not have gotten a more Romney biased panel on “Meet the Press” if you would have gone to Mitt’s campaign headquarters. Mike Murphy, GOP strategist, said Congressman Paul, “. . . would be the surprise disappointing finish.” Mark Halperin of Time Magazine said he saw “two scenarios for Romney and they were “great” and “good.” Andrea Mitchel of NBC said Paul “really hurt himself on foreign policy.” To be fair, it is not just NBC doing a hatchet job on Congressman Paul, other networks have been less than objective. Yesterday on FOX, Democratic strategist James Carville opined that Romney was the only Republican that “has a chance of winning nationally.”

I think the Democrats and President Obama would like nothing more than to run against the man who thinks “corporations are people too.” Mitt Romney would be predictable and would not go after the real issues that are holding America back. The main issue is the fraud and rip-offs in the financial system. There will be no recovery and little job creation unless and until the banks and Wall Street are no longer able to rig the system so they always win. There should also be some prosecutions, but I digress. Romney, who couldn’t get much more than 25% of the Iowa Republican vote, will be very beatable for Mr. Obama. Both are the picks of Super PAC corporations. Santorum would just be the Republican replacement for Romney if he can hold up after Iowa.

Paul, on the other hand, would be unpredictable and difficult to corner. The Congressman also has something all other Republicans envy and that is motivated, young supporters who want real change. President Obama can no longer campaign on the change slogan. He got in and nothing really changed.

If you would have said Ron Paul would be a close third in Iowa a year ago, I am sure you would have been laughed out of the room. That is the same thing you could have said about Barack Obama in January of 2008. Hillary Clinton was so strong, they were doing skits on “Saturday Night Live” belittling the other candidates in the Democratic field. We all know how that turned out. I am not stumping for Congressman Paul. I just want accurate reporting, and accurate reporting is usually fair reporting. I don’t see much objectivity from most of the MSM, and it is not asking too much for facts without spin or distortion."

This “Bretton Woods II” comes along just as the Trilateral Commission will be meeting at the same time in Washington, D.C. With an apparent goal of creating nothing less than a new global economy, Soros is spending $50 million in New Hampshire to bring together up to 200 academic, business and government policy leaders under his Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET). 



As AFP goes to press, the attendees are to include ex-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and World Bank executive and Nobel Prize winner in economics Joseph Stiglitz. 

The conference is slated for the Mount Washington Hotel, site of the historic 1944 Bretton Woods conference, which established the post-World War II international financial architecture.



Soros chose this site because he expects his proposed reforms to be as radical as those promoted by British economist John Maynard Keynes, the much-praised “genius” of the original Bretton Woods project. 



Keynesian economics have been portrayed as a cure to the Western world’s postwar devastation, in that governments were liberated of money creation restrictions imposed by the gold standard, even while global financiers controlled much of the world’s gold like they do now. Governments, under the new paradigm after the war, were encouraged to promote economic growth and macroeconomic stability by creating more debt-based money for everything that ailed the economy—debt that has brought most of the world’s economies to the brink of bankruptcy.



Now Soros comes along as the new Keynes to save the day by proposing another miracle solution to our problems, couched in lofty doublespeak such as “reform,” “cooperation” and “equal participation.” Soros is proposing the end of sovereignty as we know it. 



“Reorganizing the world order will need to extend beyond the financial system,” Soros wrote in his opinion piece.



 

 

Soros is saying that a washed-up America should be replaced by a world government with a global currency under UN rule. He also advocates that China should be top dog while we play second fiddle. What Soros doesn’t say is that two decades of outsourcing U.S. industry, opening the borders and bankrupting the economy with pointless wars and other debacles have been intentionally orchestrated so that now international bankers can tell the world the system is broken and that the individuals who broke it need to show us how to fix it. 



Georgy Schwartz, aka George Soros, is a Hungarian Jew who has been described as anti-God, anti-family and anti-American. By his own admission he even helped confiscate the homes of fellow Jews in Hungary in 1944. 



In an interview with Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes he said 1944 was the best year of his life. Asked by Kroft if he felt any remorse, he answered, “No, not at all; I rather enjoyed it.” 



“No feelings of guilt?” asked Kroft. “No,” answered Soros, “only feelings of power.”



Soros made his first billion as a currency speculator in 1992 by shorting the British pound and causing misery to millions of hardworking British citizens. He went on to cause the 1999 Russiagate scandal, almost collapsing the Russian economy. It was described as “one of the greatest social robberies in human history.” 



He did the same to Thailand and Malaysia in 1997, causing the Asian financial crisis of that time. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called him “a villain and a moron,” while Thailand's PM referred to him as “Dracula.” He also helped dismantle Yugoslavia and caused major trouble in Japan, Indonesia, Georgia, Ukraine and Burma by raiding their economies. 



Soros also fosters cultural degeneracy by supporting abortion rights, atheism, drug legalization, sex education, euthanasia, feminism, gun control, globalization, mass immigration, gay marriage etc. Soros funded Barack Obama’s campaign and often visits the White House.



At 81, taking down America appears to be his final challenge. “The main obstacle to a stable and just world order is the United States. The time has come for a very serious adjustment,” he said.

The Obama administration’s announcement to explore “geo-engineering” the environment in the name of preventing global warming has given fresh impetus to concerns about whether such programs are already underway in the guise of chemtrails.

Chemtrails differ from ordinary contrails in that they hang in the sky for hours and are often observed to be emitted from planes that fly criss-cross routes, leading to the formation of ‘X’ and grid-like patterns in the sky. Chemtrails also directly effect localized weather by turning a clear blue sky into a hazy overcast.

Last year, a KSLA news investigation found that a substance that fell to earth from a high altitude chemtrail contained high levels of Barium (6.8 ppm) and Lead (8.2 ppm) as well as trace amounts of other chemicals including arsenic, chromium, cadmium, selenium and silver. Of these, all but one are metals, some are toxic while several are rarely or never found in nature. The newscast focuses on Barium, which its research shows is a “hallmark of chemtrails.” KSLA found Barium levels in its samples at 6.8 ppm or “more than six times the toxic level set by the EPA.”

KSLA also asked Mark Ryan, Director of the Poison Control Center, about the effects of Barium on the human body. Ryan commented that “short term exposure can lead to anything from stomach to chest pains and that long term exposure causes blood pressure problems.” The Poison Control Center further reported that long-term exposure, as with any harmful substance, would contribute to weakening the immune system, which many speculate is the purpose of such man-made chemical trails.

Indeed, barium oxide has cropped up repeatedly as a contaminant from suspected geoengineering experimentation.

KSLA also put aerosolized-chemical testing in its historical context, citing a voluminous number of unclassified tests exposed in 1977 Senate hearings. The tests included experimenting with biochemical compounds on the public. KSLA reports that “239 populated areas were contaminated with biological agents between 1949 and 1969.”

The announcement this week that the Obama administration has held discussions regarding the possibility of “geo-engineering” the earth’s climate to counter global warming by “shooting pollution particles into the upper atmosphere to reflect the sun’s rays” has stoke fresh concerns that similar programs are already underway, and that chemtrails are directly connected to such experimentation.

Indeed, as we covered in previous article, numerous universities and government agencies have been conducting studies in this field for years.

In addition, the Obama administration’s interest in exploring “geo-engineering” mirrors recent publications penned by the elite Council On Foreign Relations.

In a document entitled Geoengineering: Workshop on Unilateral Planetary Scale Geoengineering, the CFR proposes different methods of “reflecting sunlight back into space,” which include adding “small reflecting particles in the upper part of the atmosphere,” adding “more clouds in the lower part of the atmosphere,” and placing “various kinds of reflecting objects in space either near the earth or at a stable location between the earth and the sun.”

The proposals in the CFR document match exactly the atmospheric effects observed in the aftermath of chemtrail spraying.

An excellent new video summarizing concerns about chemtrails entitled Geoengineering and Eugenics has just been released by Media Rival Productions. This footage shows huge windowless airplanes dispersing chemtrails, as well as aircraft that appear to turn chemtrail emissions on and off in mid-flight. The fact that something is being deliberately dispersed is clear from the video and cannot be confused with crop-dusting which is done by light aircraft at low altitudes.

This video is a fantastic summary of the chemtrail issue and needs to go viral. We need to push the issue of chemtrails to the forefront of public awareness and force the corporate media to cover the subject. Only then will cracks begin to appear in the unified wall of denial that authorities have erected around the issue thus far.

The clip is embedded below along with two additional videos also recently put out by Media Rival Productions.

Wireless technology to this day is founded on this lawless, corrupt beginning

Lloyd George used the British War Cabinet (1917) to consolidate British control of global wireless and Tavistock propaganda permanently (e.g., SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Geoffrey Pattie, Malloch-Brown, Clegg, Allan ) Lloyd George, the future prime minister, and attorney-general Rufus Isaacs, bought insider stock from Isaac’s brother, managing director of Marconi—using their inside information on coming British Marconi contracts (“The Marconi Scandal”)

On Apr. 27, 1912, David Lloyd George, Chancellor of the Exchequer, the future Prime Minister of Great Britain and Governor of the Imperial War Cabinet (Dec. 14, 1916), faced one of the gravest corruption crises in his career. On Apr. 12, 1912, Lloyd George, along with Rufus Daniel Isaacs, Attorney-General (1st Marquess of Reading, GCB, GCSI, GCIE, GCVO, Privy Council (10 October 1860 – 30 December 1935) was a British Liberal politician and judge, who served as Lord Chief Justice of England, Viceroy of India, and Foreign Secretary, the last Liberal to hold that post), the attorney general, he had purchased shares in the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America at a rate well below that available to the general public. The American Marconi company was legally independent of the British concern, but the two companies were closely connected, and the latter’s shares had recently boomed as a result of the government’s decision to accept its proposal to construct a chain of radio stations throughout the empire.[1702]

Godfrey Issacs, Rufus’ brother managing director of the English Marconi, arranged the sale at below-market prices.

A third investor, Master of Elibank (later) Lord Murray, Privy Council, Sec. of the Treasury, invested Liberal party funds as chief whip, paying £2 on Apr. 17, 1913 for American Marconi shares that jumped to £3.3 per share the next day. (PDF, p. 113).

The Crown and The City created the allusion of private control of companies to fool investors

The ensuing Parliamentary inquiry into the corruption reveals that “one preference share on behalf of himself and other shareholders” in English Marconi was made by Cecil Chesterton, the brother of writer G.K. Chesterton. In subsequent lawfare and media propaganda, the existence of this share was smothered in obfuscation. The nature and power of this share was never revealed outside of Queen’s Court. Researchers strongly believe that it is quite likely one of the earliest “Golden Shares” issued to the monarch thru intermediaries to control “privatized” companies secretly, while fooling the public markets into thinking they are publicly controlled. (PDF, p. 37). G.K. Chesterton (his brother) and George Bernard (writers for the British War Propaganda Bureau), denied in their propaganda.

George and Isaacs denied, in somewhat ambiguous language, any transactions in the shares of “the Marconi company,” a denial that technically referred only to the British company but was generally assumed to cover the American Marconi that was majority-controlled subsidiary as well. A select committee of the House of Commons revealed the facts and, although by a party majority it acquitted the ministers of blame, Lloyd George’s reputation was damaged, but Cecil Rhodes’ Round Table disciples (Milner, Buchan Masterman, Law, Chesterton, Shaw, Smuts) exploited Lloyd George’s weakened political state to take over Parliament Imperial War Cabinet.[1701]

The combination of the Golden Share and 56% controlling interest in American Marconi gave the British tight control of the global wireless telegraphy deployment worldwide from inception before World War I. The weaponized technology was used for naval communications and mass propaganda mind control and brain washing. British SERCO has effectively hijacked technology worldwide via “The Internet of Things.” SERCO also runs the U.S. Patent Office under contract from the Senior Executive Services (SES) shadow government.

History reveals that these unethical acts by Lloyd George and Issacs founded the entire modern world of wireless high technology on a corrupt foundation from which it has never recovered, and in fact, has veered into nefarious uses such as euthanasia, war mongering, monopoly, property theft, abusive taxation, wars, false flags, hedge funds, oppression, lying, tyranny, slavery, human trafficking, money laundering, illegal surveillance, pedophilia, insider trading, racketeering, bribery, drug abuse, murder, mutilation, genocide, drug trafficking, pornography, blackmail, luciferian blood and body parts trafficking, ritual child abuse and sacrifice (The Seven Deadly Sins). Indeed, Jesus Christ warned about building human activity on depraved moral foundations in the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders in Matthew 7:24-27."
563,True,The article promotes conspiracy theories about the cervical cancer vaccine causing harm and the pharmaceutical industry covering up the truth.,True,The article mentions Big Pharma as the actor responsible for the harm caused by the cervical cancer vaccine.,True,"The article claims that the pharmaceutical industry conducted medical experiments on Jewish concentration camp prisoners during the Nazi era and continues to commit fraud, kill children, and engage in monopolistic marketing behavior.",True,"The article suggests that the vaccination campaign is a holocaust and compares it to the Nazi holocaust, claiming that it will result in neurological impairment, seizures, and deaths.",True,The article connects various incidents and claims to support the conspiracy theories about the pharmaceutical industry and vaccination campaigns.,True,The article implies that the pharmaceutical industry is intentionally covering up the truth about the harm caused by vaccines.,"As the cervical cancer vaccine continues to maim or kill even more teenage girls across the UK, 18-year-old Stacey Jones is the latest victim to suffer severe harm. Previously in a state of apparent health, Stacey began to suffer severe seizures and brain inflammation within days after receiving the Cervarix vaccine injection. The swelling of her brain was so severe that it cause permanent brain damage, and today Stacey Jones is an “empty shell” of a girl.

Her mother isn’t fooled by Big Pharma. “I really feel she has been used as a guinea pig,” she said in a DailyMail news article (source below). “I don’t think there is enough evidence that the vaccination programme is safe – this all happened days after Stacey was given the vaccine, and we don’t have any other explanation for what triggered her brain injury.”

Just last week, 14-year-old Natalie Morton died within hours after receiving the same vaccine injection. Medical authorities insisted Natalie suddenly died of a previously undiagnosed tumor in her chest, but NaturalNews was the first to suggest fraud in the pathology report, pointing out that Natalie’s real cause of death had to be covered up to protect the lucrative vaccine industry.

As the deaths mount, vaccines are becoming the new chemical holocaust of our time. Children and teens are lined up to be injected with chemicals made by some of the very same companies that once conducted medical experiments on Jewish concentration camp prisoners during the Nazi era (http://www.naturalnews.com/019189.html).

Did you know, for example, that one of the chemotherapy drugs still used in cancer centers today was originally developed under the chemical weapons program of Nazi Germany? (http://www.naturalnews.com/News_000…)

Vaccines don’t kill as many people as the Nazi gas chambers, but the number of people being targeted by the vaccination holocaust is many times larger than the number imprisoned in Nazi Germany.

The corporations behind all this, of course, are much the same. So are the people. A 10-year Chairman of Bayer, for example, was a convicted Nazi war criminal. As explained on another NaturalNews article:

“Dr. Fritz ter Meer, a director of IG Farben who was directly involved in developing the nerve gas, Zyklon-B, which killed millions of Jews, was sentenced to seven years in prison but was released after four years through the intervention of Rockefeller and J.J. McCloy, then U.S. High Commissioner for Germany. An unrepentant Fritz ter Meer, guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, returned to work in Bayer where he served as Chairman for more than 10 years, until 1961.

 (http://www.naturalnews.com/024534_h…)

Whether we’re talking about Nazi war crimes or mass vaccination campaigns, the intent is the same: power and control over people. If you’re a new reader on NaturalNews and not yet familiar with the historical involvement of the pharmaceutical industry in Nazi Germany, read the above article link to get up to speed.

Being injected with a vaccine is a lot like being branded with an identification number tattoo in a prison camp. They are both administered via threats and intimidation (a mandatory vaccine push is now under way in the U.S.), they both involve government power over the freedoms of the people, and they both seek to control and corral the people into narrowly-defined realms of “acceptable” state-approved behavior.

When you allow yourself to be injected with a vaccine, you are in effect labeling yourself a medical slave of the Big Pharma-dominated system of western medicine. You are making a statement that you don’t believe in your own body’s immune system and you don’t believe in health freedom. You are, in effect, acting like “a good little Nazi” with a hail to the Big Pharma fuhrer.

I stand firm on the belief that anyone who truly knew the details of the history of Big Pharma would never allow their bodies to be invaded with vaccines. The only people who are allowing themselves to be injected are those who are utterly ignorant of the last hundred years of human medical experimentation that has been undertaken by the pharmaceutical industry.

Did you know, for example, that Pfizer used Nigerian children for medical experiments? (http://www.naturalnews.com/023654.html)

Did you know that Pfizer also pleaded guilty to a felony crime in the fraudulent marketing of one of its top drugs?

 (http://www.naturalnews.com/026963_P…)

Were you aware that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), one of the key manufacturers of the swine flu vaccine, ordered the continuation of a vaccine trial even after 12 babies died?

 (http://www.naturalnews.com/023669.html)

Did you also know that GSK was sued for price-fixing fraud by 40 states?

 (http://www.naturalnews.com/019947_G…)

Read more shocking (but true) reports about GSK here:

 http://www.naturalnews.com/GlaxoSmi…

There’s an undeniable pattern of behavior in the pharmaceutical industry that simply must be acknowledged: It is a greed-driven corporate monstrosity that routinely commits fraud, kills children, engages in monopolistic marketing behavior, intimidates scientists and conducts pharmaceutical medical experiments on human patients (among other crimes).

In fact, takers of the swine flu vaccine are unwittingly taking part in the largest global medical experiment ever conducted. The results of that experiment won’t be known for many years, but they will almost certainly include neurological impairment, seizures, and many deaths. Watch for reports on the side effects of the swine flu vaccine at www.SwineFluVaccineReport.com

In future history books, today’s mass vaccination campaigns will be seen in much the same way as the Nazi holocaust: A terrible, avoidable atrocity that suckered in almost everyone (including lots of intelligent people). One day, I truly believe the CEOs of drug companies will be arrested and tried for their crimes against humanity, perhaps in a venue similar to the Nuremberg Trials (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremb…).

Michelle Obama is now president of the United States and will not only fill out Biden’s term but will retain her eligibility to run again in her own right in 2024 when she will have turned 60. You have just entered into The Twilight Zone.

On live television, Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will tearfully announce that the 78-year-old president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” and that under the 25th Amendment, he’s resigning. Michelle Obama is now president of the United States. Welcome to the Twilight Zone.

When the 2020 Democratic Party election process began, it boasted a massive field of candidates who were quite diverse. But when the smoke cleared and the dust settled, the Democrats had picked the nearly 80-year old Joe Biden, a man who literally is losing his mind as we watch. Why on earth would they do that? Joe Biden could never, in a million years and on his best day beat Donald Trump, and they know that. Yep, they sure do know that, and that’s why they picked the fumbling, stumbling and occasionally sexaully assaulting Uncle Joe Biden. He is the perfect foil.

The folks over at the New York Post had a great take on it this morning, it’s a great article and you should read the whole thing. But what I have culled from it is the stunning bullet point list of just why picking Joe Biden, who can’t even remember his own stories any longer, is a wickedly smart way to go. It plays out as follows:

How Michelle Obama could easily win eight more years in the White House, with Barack as her vice president

Here’s how it would work:
• In the next month or so, Biden would announce Michelle Obama as his running mate. With a little reverse engineering of the Obama-Biden bumper stickers of 2008 and 2012, they’re good to go.
• Michelle would immediately attract the undying worship of the national press corps. With the country still in lockdown, she can wave to Andrea Mitchell & Co. from the front door of her residences in Washington, DC ($8.1 million purchase price), Martha’s Vineyard ($11.75 million) or Chicago ($1.65 million).
• Barack Obama, who manfully supports his wife in all her endeavors, would joke about being the First Husband and cite his familiarity with the White House as a qualification.
• Nov. 3: With the black vote and the Bernie Sanders wing of the party solidly behind them, the Biden-Obama(s) team would defeat Trump in both the popular vote and the Electoral College, flipping Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina and winning both houses of Congress.
• January 20, 2021: Joe Biden is inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States.
• January 21: On live television, Joe and Dr. Jill Biden tearfully announce that the 78-year-old president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” and that under the 25th Amendment, he’s resigning. Michelle Obama is now president of the United States and will not only fill out Biden’s term but will retain her eligibility to run again in her own right in 2024 when she will have turned 60.

Now you know why the Democrats wanted Joe Biden so bad, add Michelle Obama to the ticket and you have the fake news media broadcasting her every utterance around the clock from now to election day. Remember how often when Michelle and Barack Obama were in the White House the media featured her on fashion magazines, ironic since she is very unfashionable and highly unphotogenic without massive lighting and myriad makeup layers.

NEW BOOK CALLED ‘THE MICHELLE OBAMA TRANSGENDER GUIDE’ GIVES ACCOUNTING OF HOW BARACK OBAMA EMPOWERED THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY, SO WHY IS IT NAMED AFTER MICHELLE?

Every time the fake news media has a poll of the ‘most admired women in America‘, somehow it is always Michelle Obama that wins it. And yet, she does literally nothing. Her last event of note was being the face of the ‘Michelle Obama Transgender Guide‘, a tome bragging about how she and her husband destroyed the moral fabric of America nearly single-handedly. Why, why, WHY would the media keep this woman front and center so many years after they left the White House?

Because this was the plan all along. But you need a stooge, a patsy, a mark to pull it off. Creepy Uncle Joe Biden is such a man.

Granted, this is a crazy plan, it is a radical plan, and it’s a plan that perhaps the Trump Team is not prepared for. But can you imagine the Liberal frenzy if Biden picks her as running mate, with everyone salivating because they know the 25th Amendment would be right around the corner? Remember when Biden tried quoting from the Declaration of Independence? “We hold these truths to be self-evident, All men and women created by — you know, you know, the thing.” Watch out for the crazy, radical plans, sometimes they work pretty good. And Joe Biden, I would say you should watch your back, but something tells me you’ve already stopped.

Think We Exaggerate About The Mental Health Of Joe Biden?"

If the Supreme Court of India has anything to say about it, he will face the ramifications of poisoning millions of Indian children with vaccines.

A recent report published by Health Impact News shows that a vaccine empire built on lies can only go on for so long. The reports states:

“While fraud and corruption are revealed on almost a daily basis now in the vaccine industry, theU.S. mainstream media continues to largely ignore such stories. Outside the U.S., however, the vaccine empires are beginning to crumble, and English versions of the news in mainstream media outlets are available via the Internet. One such country is India, where the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and their vaccine empire are under fire, including a pending lawsuit currently being investigated by the India Supreme Court.”

If you aren’t aware of the key players in the vaccine mayhem being driven into African countries, they are:
• PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, funded by the Gates’ foundation), and
• GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, also funded by the Gates’ foundation)

All four of these organizations will now be expected to explain themselves due to a writ of petition originally submitted to the Supreme Court of India in 2012, by Kalpana Mehta, Nalini Bhanot, and Dr. Rukmini Rao, which has finally been heard by the courts.

Furthermore, though absent from most mainstream U.S. media outlets, the Economic Times of India published their report in August 2014, stating that young tribal girls were tested with HPV vaccines. This involved not a handful of children, but 16,000 individuals in Andhra Pradesh, India, where they were given the Gardasil vaccine.

KP Narayana Kumar reported that within a month of receiving the vaccine, many of the children fell ill, and by 2010, five of them had died. Another two children were reported to have died in Vadodara, Gujarat, where another 14,000 tribal children were vaccinated with another brand of the HPV vaccine, Cervarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmitheKline (GSK), who incidentally, has been accused of dumping polio virus into a Belgium river.

Consent forms to administer the HPV vaccine were ‘illegally’ signed by wardens form youth hostels, showing that the Gates’ prey on the indigent without parents. For those who had parents, most were illiterate, and the true potential dangers of the vaccines were not explained to them.

SAMA, an organization in India which promotes women’s health discovered this insidiousness, and reported it, but only now will Gates and his cronies have to answer for their misdeeds. Approximately 120 girls reported epileptic seizures, severe stomach cramps, headaches, and mood swings, of those who did not die. Other girls receiving the Gardasil vaccine have experienced infertility.

“The SAMA report also said there had been cases of early onset of menstruation following the vaccination, heavy bleeding and severe menstrual cramps among many students. The standing committee pulled up the relevant state governments for the shoddy investigation into these deaths. It said it was disturbed to find that ‘all the seven deaths were summarily dismissed as unrelated to vaccinations without in-depth investigations …’the speculative causes were suicides, accidental drowning in well (why not suicide?), malaria, viral infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage (without autopsy) etc.”

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation declared their little vaccine project a total success. I guess the Supreme Court of India will decide that now."

Every day that goes by, more and more Americans become more deeply entrenched and brainwashed into believing what they’re told by their boob tube (television), newspapers, magazines and propaganda-spreading websites, like WebMD, Forbes.com and Slate.com. People become more paranoid and outright delusional about infectious diseases, a Trump Presidency, food allergies and domestic terrorism. People, or sheeple as they should be called, follow all the wrong leaders, the worst advice and their own “expertise” about their health, welfare, finances and safety – and thus become more endangered and poisoned by their state of mind. To them, conspiracy theories are just that, and they’re so afraid to look at the truth that reality actually hurts their souls.

However, for tens of millions of other Americans, the wake up call came and they heeded it this year. That’s why Donald Trump won the Presidency. One look at the number of U.S. states that went “red” on November 8th and 9th is “proof in the pudding.” Everything the “Donald” preached about was proven true, and when videos and leaked emails went viral on social media and Alternative “Truth” Media, the Constitution also came out the victor.

Let’s take a close look at the top 10 “conspiracy theories” that were not only proven true these past few years, but that changed the course of history forever, putting someone in charge of the free world who called the bluff of all the lying globalists and the evil tyranny that ran the U.S. government for the past 24 years (Yes, Obama, Bush and the notorious Bill Clinton).

1. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were trying to rig the Presidential election.

2. While Obama and his family eat organic food, they want the rest of the country eating GMOs and dying of cancer and dementia.

3. Nearly all (if not all) of the violent protesting (before and after the election) regarding Trump is paid for and orchestrated by the Clinton Crime Family and George Soros.

5. The U.S. Government wants to force-vaccinate as many children as possible, increasing rates of autism, infertility and abortions.

6. Planned Parenthood’s main goal is to increase the number of African American abortions and sell aborted baby remains (hearts, brains and organs) for cash on the black market.

7. Obama, Bill Gates and other globalists (like Sloan and Rockefeller) believe in genocide and a depopulation agenda, and use GMOs and vaccines to “work the plan” of reducing the world population by billions of people over the next few decades. Here is Bill Gates at a TED conference outright preaching that vaccines can be used for depopulation.

8. Many “top notch” cancer care centers like Karmanos and Sloan Kettering in America are really death camps that breed a slow, miserable death for their “patients” using surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and other dangerous, experimental drugs that rarely, if ever, work.

9. Monsanto hires and pays shills to regurgitate their propaganda as “facts” in order to brainwash Americans into believing GMO food is safe and beneficial for the world. These shills, hucksters, hacks and charlatans include certain journalists, academics, public scientists and FDA officials and regulators.

10. Zika virus is like the flu and has nothing to do with mosquitoes or the birth defects (microcephaly) that the CDC and CNN are hysterically propagating. In fact, cases of Zika date back 50 years to Uganda, Africa, and Southeast Asia as a mild viral infection similar to having a head cold. Symptoms last about a week. Zero cases of microcephaly were documented from the Zika epidemic that affected three quarters of the entire Yap island population. The truth about microcephaly in Brazil was the mass amounts of toxic pesticide dumped into the water supply. The whole scam was about inventing a vaccine for Zika and getting at least 200 million Americans to buy it. The vaccine most likely would have contained mercury, aluminum and formaldehyde in order to create expensive health detriment for more Big Pharma profits.

Bonus! Due to popular demand, we must cover a bonus “realm” of one of the greatest hoaxes of all time that has recently been completely and utterly debunked! Coming in at number 11 is the hoax that made Al Gore a filthy rich, pathetic human being …

11. Global Warming (climate change) is a complete and utter hoax, is not caused by mankind or our actions, and earth is actually at the beginning of a long and slow cooling trend right now. Thousands of scientists have now declared “Catastrophic Man-Made Global Warming” to be a complete hoax and a lie based on zero scientific evidence. What happened then? The mass media spread a great lie across the TV news, newspapers, magazines and the internet. Most Americans now believe that “99 percent of scientists believe in global warming,” even though that statistic is completely fabricated, warped, skewed and comes from a study where only 75 cherry-picked scientists were “interviewed.”"

Catastrophic forest fires connected directly to the effercts of climate engineering are raging completely out of control from Fort McMurry, Canada, to Manitoba, to the Himalayas. The global burn-down has been accelerating around the globe in recent years and will continue to spiral ever further out of control.

Deadly radiation spewing from the Fukushima nuclear volcano is contributing to the countless other sources of anthropogenic contamination which are rapidly poisoning our formerly thriving planet. Is the Fukushima fallout the greatest source radiation danger to the US West Coast? Or is there an even greater radiation threat that is largely unknown to the US public and that is being aggressively hidden by those in power? The massive nuclear nightmare in Hanford, Washington is just such a threat.

The lack of concern our government has shown to the care and maintenance of this sign is a direct reflection of their attitude toward protecting Americans from real and immediate dangers to their health and their lives.

The power structure, the ""public protection"" agencies they control, and the corporate media that represents them all, are constantly and actively engaged in the effort to hide the severity of the converging catastrophes from the population for as long as possible. Will the masses finally turn their eyes to the horizon and wake up in time to make a difference? The latest installment of Global Alert News is below.

Yes, the horizon is dark indeed, but does that fact exempt any of us from our obligation to press on in the battle to sound the alarm until we reach a critical mass of awareness? No. Make your voice heard efficiently and effectively by passing on credible data to those that are still unaware of the rapidly gathering storm on many fronts and the climate engineering insanity in our skies. Make every day count in the all important battle to sound the alarm.

Shias are NOT Muslims- they may claim to be Muslims but any sane person who studies their beliefs and then compares it to the rest of the Muslims worldwide, will realize that these are two different religions.

yes, there's differences among Muslims but what we differ on are issues that don't clearly take a person out of the folds of Islam.

on one hand Shias claim to believe in what we believe but at the same time, they have beliefs that INSTANTLY take a person out of the fold of islam.

it's like saying a person is a Christian Jew or a Christian Muslim- u cant be both.

same with saying Shia Muslim. theres Shias & then there's muslims.

if we trace the history of the Shias, their so-called religion was started by a Yemeni Jew who pretended to accept Islam- Abdullah bin Sabah.

there's also many convenient disinfo Shia sites that deny and ridicule this fact.

today, most Shias are very secular and basically don't follow any real religion at all- u could say they're neither Shia nor Muslim.

for all their talk of hating the Zionist regime, the Shias are secretly working very closely with them & the west to weaken & destroy Muslim countries. the danger of Iran is that many Muslims still seem to think they're not our enemies & this makes them more dangerous.

Shias like to talk of unity, a LOT but every year the Shia regime hangs Muslims in Iran solely for speaking out and challenging the regimes lies about unity & fighting for equal treatment by the Shia regime."
571,True,The article suggests that there is biased news coverage favoring Donald Trump and that this bias is explained by the control of the media by a small number of corporations connected to the political and economic elites.,True,"The article mentions powerful actors such as Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, and the media conglomerates (Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, Bertelsmann, and Viacom).",True,The article discusses the biased news coverage favoring Donald Trump and the control of the media by a small number of corporations.,False,There is no mention of any threats in the article.,True,"The article connects events and observations, such as the biased news coverage and the control of the media by powerful actors, to suggest a conspiracy.",True,The article suggests that the control of the media by a small number of corporations is not widely known or discussed.,"If you can do basic math, then you know that Donald J. Trump has no chance to be America’s next president because of his harsh ideas and anti-Hispanic fever. Yet, according to a report, media outlets’ news coverage is dedicated disproportionately between the Republicans and Democrats, clearly slanting towards GOP’s Donald Trump.

A Tyndall report said that the Republican primary race has received more than twice as much coverage as the Democratic contest.

Tyndall’s task is to track the airtime that the various flagship news programs on NBC, CBS and ABC dedicate to a variety of stories; the 2016 election has received 857 minutes of combined coverage, through Nov. 30.

Sources debate the fact, saying that it is justified since there are more Republican candidates than Democrat ones, and that the GOP debates have much more news than the Democrats. Yet, looking a litter deeper into the details of the coverage is clear rejection to this claim.

According to the report, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, unsurprisingly, is the most-covered candidate in the race. In fact, he alone has gotten more airtime (234 minutes) than the entire Democratic field (226 minutes).

What is remarkable, according to the report, is that Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont who actually is running and polled well for much of the summer and fall, has gotten the least airtime among all candidates (10 minutes), making it only around 4% of the coverage.

The report uncovered that CBS and NBC made up over nine of those minutes, while ABC News devoted less than one minute of coverage to Bernie Sanders for all of 2015.

At the time Trump is currently polling at 34% among GOP, Sanders is currently polling at 33% among Democrats. The percentage of Americans who identify as Democrats is 32% compared to only 23% of Republicans, which means Bernie has many more supporters than Trump. Democrats hold advantages in party identification among blacks, Asians, Hispanics, well-educated adults and Millennials. Republicans have leads among whites – particularly white men, those with less education and evangelical Protestants – as well as members of the Silent Generation.

The GOP needs 40% of the Latino vote to win. Romney is not even close to that, but Trump is not favorable among Latinos, with a record 51% who believe he is very unfavorable. Still, he is all over the news throughout the year. Over three-fourths of Hispanic Americans have an unfavorable opinion of the outspoken billionaire, according to the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey.

Trump has repeatedly vowed he is winning the Hispanic vote next year despite his harsh rhetoric on border security and illegal immigration. Critics frequently argue his message on illegal immigrants, particularly Hispanics, is derogatory.

This bias coverage is explained. There aren't numerous US mass media news sources at all; there are just five. Five giant corporations control 90 percent of US mass media. And direct links connect all five of these media conglomerates to the political establishment and the economic and political power-elites of the United States.

These five conglomerates are Time Warner, Disney, Murdochs' News Corporation, Bertelsmann of Germany, and Viacom (formerly CBS). Their control spans most of the newspapers, magazines, books, radio and TV stations, movie studios, and much of the web news content of the United States."

Col at the Pentagon, and a deputy Attorney General ALL between 1981 and 1985? As luck would have it, I grew up in a town that EXACT same size. I have an amazing reference point here. This is not possible.

This dig was started on Rod Rosenstein. Naturally, on a dig like this going back into a person’s history, the parents get a look as well.

 Let’s look at Rod’s.

 His father, specifically, Robert J Rosenstein.

When you search for Robert J Rosenstein, the bulk of the results will be a near verbatim variation of this sentiment, taken from multiple variations of a quote by Rod himself (father- small business owner, mother- bookkeeper, school board- it’s like he’s shilling his own life)

Note the DOJ link date. June, 2018.

 He’s been shilling the humble parents since 2017, numerous times. It is the only real mention he makes of his parent’s professions. In this statement, he also mentions Miriam Smalls, partner of Robert in the “small business”.

Rosenstein/Smalls, I can only assume. R/S Financial, Robert and Miriam.

Robert J Rosenstein and Miriam Smalls have more than a small business, they have several.

 National Mortgage Network is in Georgia, but was dissolved one minute after filed.

 Environmental Science and Technologies even shares the same address as R/S Financial.

The only documentation I could dig up on R/S were some court docs where they were co defendants with a man (also their attorney) named Richard Sprague in Philadelphia in the early 2000’s.

Richard Sprague (Robert Rosenstein’s attorney/ co defendant) is not ONE OF the most connected and sleazy lawyers in Philadelphia, he is the most feared by far. He represents Democrat filth. Vince Fumo and Kathleen Kane, for example. His reputation is well known.

Now figure this one out- Robert Rosenstein’s “small business” lawyer is not only the biggest shark in Philly for the last 50 years, but in 1977 Richard Sprague was appointed Chief Counsel of the newly formed House Select Committee on Assassinations.

Sprague has quite the history in Philadelphia, and the resume to match. From the Sprague & Sprague home site ⬇️

If you needed another reason to cancel your Netflix subscription, consider the streaming service’s new partnership with Barack Obama, who along with Michelle Obama will soon be given a platform to spread anti-American propaganda via a new original series.

A recent announcement by Netflix explains that the company has entered into “a multi-year agreement” with the Obamas to “produce films and series for Netflix, potentially including scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries, and features.”

The plan is to give the former president a global platform to tell his “stories.” In speaking publicly about the agreement, Obama explained that he’s personally excited about having the ability to “train the next generation of leaders” without having to be in the White House or even hold the title of president.

“Everyone has a story that is pretty sacred,” Obama reportedly stated, adding that listening to these stories has helped him to become a better public servant. “We want to tell stories. This [Netflix deal] becomes a platform. We are interested in lifting people up and identifying people doing amazing work. We did this in the White House,” Obama added.

Two examples that Obama pointed to were meetings with both Hamilton creator and Broadway producer Lin-Manuel Miranda and Bruce Springsteen. Obama wants to find others who want to tell their stories as well, and he wants to broadcast this through Netflix to people all around the world.

Stories that “we think are important, and lift up and identify talent, that can amplify the connections between all of us” are what Obama says he’s most concerned with conveying to the world. “I continue to believe that if we are hearing each other’s stories and recognizing ourselves in each other, then our democracy works,” Obama added.

Obama pushes one world order in Netflix spiel; says people should avoid “tribalism”

Building upon the anti-American principles he pushed so aggressively while occupying the White House, Obama explained, in so many words, that everyone in the world needs to come together. He warned against the tendency towards “tribalism,” which is code for sovereign nations, people groups, and borders.

“We are all human,” Obama stated. “I know this sounds trite, and yet, right now globally, we have competing narratives … We go tribal. We go ethnic. We pull in, we push away.”

These are rather ironic comments for Obama to make, considering that positive race relations plummeted to the lowest levels ever under Obama’s leadership. The racist group Black Lives Matter, as one example, both began and flourished while Obama was president.

And yet, now, Obama wants to lecture the world into “cooperating” with one another and “sharing their stories.” He even wants to use Netflix as an opportunity for he and Michelle to “set up institutions based on rule of law and a sense of principals and the dignity and worth of every individual.”

In other words, Obama’s plan is to sidestep President Trump entirely and continue leading from people’s laptop and television screens. And Michelle has no plans to stop being a pseudo First Lady, either, having stated back in early May during a high school event in Philadelphia that she intends to be a “forever First Lady.”

Both Obamas obviously think very highly of themselves, believing themselves to be God’s gift to mankind when it comes to solving the “clash” that currently exists in American politics. Using one world order rhetoric, the two plan to “be a voice” to raise an army of “next generation” leaders both in the United States and abroad – and Netflix is the entity working alongside them to make this happen."
574,True,"This article discusses a conspiracy theory involving Roger Stone, Randy Credico, and WikiLeaks. It suggests that Stone had insider information about the WikiLeaks release of Hillary Clinton's emails before it happened, and that Credico was the source of this information. The article also mentions allegations of Russian agents conspiring with the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 election.",True,"The article mentions several actors, including Roger Stone, Randy Credico, Julian Assange, Margaret Ratner Kunstler, and the Clintons.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by Roger Stone, Randy Credico, and WikiLeaks, such as leaking information, communicating through text messages, and investigating the Clintons.",False,There is no explicit mention of a threat in the article.,True,"The article connects events and specific observations to suggest a conspiracy involving Roger Stone, Randy Credico, and WikiLeaks.",True,"The article suggests that there was secrecy surrounding the WikiLeaks release of Hillary Clinton's emails, with Stone and Credico communicating through text messages and trying to keep their involvement hidden.","To paraphrase Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, “Liars and lawyers and leaks, oh my!”

This week’s bombshell news is that Randy Credico has been confirmed to be the source of Roger Stone‘s insider information regarding anti-Hillary documents that WikiLeaks released before the 2016 presidential election.

“Six days before WikiLeaks began releasing Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails, Roger Stone had a text message conversation with a friend about WikiLeaks, according to copies of phone records obtained exclusively by NBC News.”

That friend turns out to be Randy Credico, a comedian, radio host, activist and the former Director of the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice.

Roger Stone is a self-styled “agent provocateur” (political saboteur) who capitalized on his instant fame, while still a young man, as a Nixon-era Watergate “dirty trickster.” Stone has a long history of advising Donald Trump along the current U.S. president’s political ascension. The career strategist urged Trump to run for the Oval Office years before the 2016 race to the win.

Stone and Credico have been friends for a long time.

Many people recall that, during the summer of 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange began publishing emails Hillary Clinton sent and received while she served as the nation’s secretary of state.

At the time, Clinton was being investigated by the FBI for mishandling a personal email server such that matters of national security were hacked by foreign operators. Former FBI Director James Comey initially led the inquiry.

Clinton was found innocent of wrong-doing days before the presidential run-off, but by then, the damage from WikiLeaks had been done.

Stone knew about the WikiLeaks document release before it happened because his good pal Credico told him in a text message dated Oct. 1, 2016:

“Big news Wednesday. Now pretend you don’t know me.”

Credico continued: “Great. Hillary’s campaign will die this week.”

Sure enough, on Oct. 7, WikiLeaks published emails stolen from Clinton insider and campaign manager John Podesta.

The text messages that Stone gave NBC News proved that Credico kept Stone informed about WikiLeaks activities. Credico was able to do that because, in his own words, “I’m best friends with [Assange’s] lawyer and leave it at that and leave it alone.”

That lawyer has been identified as Margaret Ratner Kunstler.

The text exchanges between Credico and Stone show the extent of Credico’s insider information. In one conversation, Credico wrote:

“Off the Record Hillary and her people are doing a full-court press they keep Assange from making the next dump. That’s all I can tell you on this line. Please leave my name out of it.”

Stone has been questioned by Robert Mueller’s grand jury, tasked with looking into allegations that Russian agents conspired with members of the 2016 Trump election campaign staff to sway the election away from Democrat contender and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Ironically, at the same time, Stone was investigating the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation for corruption and election fraud.

Stone told the federal grand jury that Credico had leaked the news about the WikiLeaks Hillary email server document dump, but Credico denied this fact vigorously.

“I readily admit that I was furious at Randy and still am not because he wouldn’t lie but because he refuses to tell the truth,” Stone admitted to the Business Insider. Stone added that Credico “not only perjured himself before the grand jury but has threatened various witnesses who testified as to the truth.”

One example Stone gave to the grand jury was that of filmmaker David Lugo who is acquainted with both Stone and Credico. Lugo had told the grand jury that Credico “threatened to put a hole in my head” if he talked.

Tyler Nixon, one of Stone’s lawyers, appeared before the Mueller grand jury on November 2, 2018. He testified that he witnessed a conversation between Stone and Credico and that Stone had correctly named the source of his secret information.

The recent NBC text messages that Stone provided prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Stone was telling the truth all along:

Credico gets the credit for pre-leaking the WikiLeaks leak.

575,False,This article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions Ali Hameed, who sold his kidney, and the buyers who participate in the black market trade in organs.",True,The article discusses the action of selling kidneys on the black market.,False,There is no mention of any threats in the article.,False,There is no mention of any patterns in the article.,False,There is no mention of any secrecy in the article.,"Ali Hameed quit his job as a taxi driver because he no longer felt safe on Baghdad's streets. Increasingly desperate for money to help him get married, he hit on a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity - selling one of his kidneys.

Last week, in a shabby ward in the city's Al Karama hospital, he lay bandaged on a bed, one kidney lighter and $1,400 (about £765) richer after a three-hour operation.

In a nearby room, his body similarly bandaged, lay the man who had paid for it - the other player in a grim new black market trade in organs that is one of Iraq's few growth industries.

""I abandoned my taxi driving job because of the security situation,"" Mr Hameed, 22, told The Sunday Telegraph. ""I thought about joining the police or the army, but that is even more dangerous. There were no more options, so I decided to sell my kidney. I am still a young man, so I want to marry and begin a business.""

Mr Hameed received a good price for his kidney. Would-be buyers with an eye for a bargain can now pick up a new kidney for as little as $700, given the desperation of fit and healthy Iraqis for money.

Young men like Mr Hameed can be seen loitering around many big hospitals in Baghdad these days, open to bids passed on via networks of shadowy middlemen who lurk in nearby cafés.

With unemployment in Iraq at about 60 per cent, the chance to earn money by touting body parts is a more calculated risk than, say, becoming a $150-a-month rookie policeman at the mercy of suicide attackers.

In the main their customers are other Iraqis, for whom kidney problems are common thanks to decades of poor diet, water and medical care.

As news of the black market trade has spread, however, wealthier transplant ""tourists"" from around the Arab world have started flocking to Baghdad, attracted by the rock-bottom prices.

If car bombs, kidnappings and robberies are a deterrent, the price compares favourably to the $5,000 cost of a kidney on the black market in Turkey, or $3,000 in India. In Iraq, the operation itself typically costs $2,000. Even so, the risks are considerable. Baghdad's hospitals are filthy and under-resourced.

If a patient succumbs to post-operative infection or other complications, high-quality care cannot be guaranteed. The expertise needed to carry out what is a relatively simple surgical procedure is in abundance, however - the legacy of an era 15 years ago when Saddam Hussein's national health service met First World standards.

While many medics disapprove of the trade outside their hospital, if a transplant patient turns up with a willing donor, they tend not to ask too many questions.

""Many of the unemployed young men undergo this kind of surgery to get money,"" said Dr Huthaim Al Saidi, who removed Mr Hameed's kidney. ""I am against the sale of organs, so I have a condition that I will only accept donors who are relatives of the person needing the transplant. But the private hospitals don't care who they get the organs from.""

In Arab society, however, the term ""cousin"" is often used to describe someone who is a friend or a fellow tribe member. At Al Karama hospital, it is not clear how rigidly the relatives-only rule is applied.

The recipient of Mr Hameed's kidney, Ammar Muhammed, a 20-year-old college student, describes himself not as a blood relative or even an in-law, but a ""friend"". In many cases, ""friend"" appears to mean someone whose relationship with the donor was struck up at the doors of the hospital. ""I was hit by shrapnel in a car bomb explosion on my way home in Fallujah. It affected both of my kidneys,"" he said. ""Due to the lack of good health care, they got worse. I don't care how much I pay - I want to survive.""

The organised crime department of the Iraqi interior ministry has formed a special unit to clamp down on the traders, whom it says frequently dupe people into becoming donors.

Col Abdul Jabbar Abo Natiha, the head of the unit, said: ""We caught one donor from Basra who had originally come to Baghdad searching for a job. A group of guys befriended him, gave him lodgings and then insisted he paid a large amount of money in rent. They obliged him to sell his kidney to pay it. He only got $70 out of the deal.""

In 2001, the going rate for a donor was $2,000. The fact that the price has tumbled, some doctors say, suggests that Iraqis are even more desperate for money now than they were under Saddam.

""It wasn't easy two or three years ago to find a donor,"" said a senior nurse at another Baghdad hospital. ""Now patients' relatives need to make no big effort."""

The number of vaccinations mandated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has risen sharply in recent decades. These medical interventions are touted as full-proof solutions to many previously common “childhood” illnesses, including measles, mumps and chicken pox, as well as more serious diseases like polio and smallpox.

As dependence on vaccination continues to grow, fewer and fewer people know how to boost their immune systems naturally, instead placing all their trust in vaccines to keep them healthy.

This is a dangerous trend, however, because vaccines have the potential for serious side effects and long-term health problems. Interestingly, even the CDC itself openly acknowledges that “any vaccine can cause side effects.” [Emphasis added]

In addition, many vaccines aren’t that effective in the first place. It is therefore important to know how to naturally boost lifelong immunity rather than relying on ineffective and dangerous vaccinations.

There are side effects associated with ALL vaccinations

Vaccines are almost always presented as safe, 100 percent effective solutions with very few – if any – side effects. Parents allow their tiny babies to receive dozens of shots with very few of them ever being told about the serious side effects associated with these medications.

Natural Health 365 compiled a list of just some of the serious side effects associated with vaccines. All of these risks are openly acknowledged on the CDC website and/or on the package inserts of the vaccines themselves. Below are a few of the side effects linked to the most commonly administered vaccines.

A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.
• Bowel blockage which requires hospitalization and possible surgery (intussusception)

There is a similarly disturbing list of potential side effects for every single vaccine, and almost all of them are linked to serious allergic reactions.

Despite openly acknowledging that all vaccines have the potential for serious side effects, the CDC, World Health Organization and media are clamping down hard on those who do not choose to expose themselves or their children to these dangers.

The World Health Organization recently labeled these people – commonly known as anti-vaxxers – as a “global health threat,” on the same level as Ebola and climate change.

The WHO’s position is that “vaccine hesitancy” – a delay or refusal to accept vaccines – is threatening a global resurgence in vaccine-preventable diseases.

The WHO claims that vaccines prevent upwards of three million deaths each year, but that 50 percent more lives could be spared if everyone, everywhere agreed to accept every mandated vaccine. They claim that the recent resurgence in measles outbreaks is an example of how a reduction in the number of people vaccinated can cause an increase in occurrences of a disease.

Despite this type of external pressure, many people are standing their ground and refusing vaccinations. For these people, working with the body instead of against it to boost immunity naturally just makes more sense.

Focusing on eating unprocessed, non-GMO, organic produce, exercising regularly and increasing consumption of spirulina, zinc, vitamin c and other immune boosters will help the body fight off viruses and other diseases without the risks associated with vaccinations."

CNN news anchor Don Lemon attempted to criticize President Donald Trump with a D-Day “history lesson,"" which didn't work out too well.

Lemon was responding to Trump’s comments about the Kurds, along with claims they were not the United States' allies during World War II.

Following Trump's decision to pull American troops from Kurd controlled areas in Syria, he faced backlash from all sides for “abandoning” our allies in the region.

Lemon started by playing a video of Trump defending the decision from the White House.

“The Kurds are fighting for their land just so you understand. They’re fighting for their land. And as somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn’t help us in the Second World War,"" Trump said.

""They didn’t help us with Normandy as an example. They mentioned names of different battles,” the president continued.

“Okay. Just so you know, a little history lesson here,"" the news anchor said.

“The Kurds didn’t help us fight World War II, didn’t help us with Normandy. For starters, they didn’t live in Europe. You know where they do live? They live in Syria, among other places in the Middle East.”

But lemon failed to mention the fact that the D-Day invasion involved 156,000 Allied troops, many of whom did not live in Europe.

Those who landed in France on D-Day included 73,000 Americans, 22,000 Canadians, and 3,000 Australians - a total of 98,000.

On Wednesday, Trump reaffirmed his stance on ending U.S. military engagement in the Middle East, saying that invasion was the 'worst decision ever made.'

“GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!”

Trump argued the United States was drawn into the invasion of Iraq by George W. Bush under a “disproven premise” of the threat of weapons of mass destruction.

""Now we are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home,” he wrote.

“Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!”But Trump's efforts to remove troops from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria to bring them home has been faced with opposition.""

It’s no secret that the American left hates the idea of free speech for all. They believe that that part of the First Amendment only applies to those advocating or advancing the progressive agenda; the second a conservative speaks out, they are either viciously attacked, silenced, or both. The new global fight against “fake news” gives the left the perfect excuse to suppress right-of-center speech.

Correctiv is a nonprofit organization based in Germany that seeks to “give citizens access to information,” according to their website. They go on to say that they want to “uncover abuses of power and effectively strengthen our democracy,” which requires “investigative journalists” and “informed citizens.”

Now, the organization is working with Facebook to censor fake news. The problem? Correctiv is funded by none other than liberal billionaire George Soros. (RELATED: Read about how Facebook conspired with fact checkers to influence France’s upcoming election)

According to a report from the NGO Einprozent, most of Correctiv’s staff consists of people who formerly wrote for left-wing websites and publications. One of the organization’s top donors is the Brost Foundation established by Erich Brost, who previously worked for FUNKE Media Group and the left wing paper “Die Tageszeitung.”

But there’s more. The chief editor of Correctiv, Markus Grill, has worked for multiple liberal publications including the magazine “Stern” and another magazine Der Spiegel, which has a history of blatant anti-Trump bias. (RELATED: Find more news about attempts to censor journalism at Journalism.news)

Perhaps most significant is Correctiv’s ties to George Soros, whose Open Society Foundation has donated €26,884 directly to the Germany-based organization. Additionally, the Soros-funded Adessium Foundation, which typically focuses on environmental issues, donated €114,000 to Correctiv.

For those who are unaware, virtually anything with George Soro’s fingerprints on it is bad news. Nearly everything that he does and every dollar that he donates has as its purpose the introduction of a new world order and the destruction of conservative republicanism. He is a radical ideologue through and through. Soros once said in an interview with 60 Minutes that, “I am basically there to make money. I cannot, and do not, look at the social consequences of what I do.”

The idea of a man like this indirectly working with Facebook to determine what is “fake news” and what isn’t should make the hair on the back of your neck stand straight up.

Correctiv is not the only organization that Facebook is partnering with to sensor and combat fake news. Late last year it was reported that the social media giant was working with ABC News and Snopes to fact check information online.

Snopes has a staff that almost entirely consists of outspoken liberal democrats. Managing editor Brook Binkowski once posted on social media that Brexit supporters were “pandering to racist mouth-breather ‘Britain First’ types.” Editor-at-large Arturo Garcia also helps manage Racialicious, a pro Black Lives Matter website. Another Snopes writer, Kim Lacapria, once referred to Tea Party members as “teahadists.”

These are not bipartisan journalists and fact checkers; they are libtard hacks and nothing less.

There’s a reason why big name liberals like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and George Soros are all pushing for immediate action to stop the spread of so-called fake news. Ironically, it has nothing to do with preventing the spread of fake news, and everything to do with preventing the spread of conservative news. (RELATED: Read about how the federal government tried to destroy the First Amendment to bury Planned Parenthood videos).

Consider this: if the liberals really were against propaganda and misinformation, then why have they been so silent for all these years while networks like MSNBC and CNN have done nothing but lied to the American people? Why is this such a big concern of theirs now? Could it be one last ditch effort to suppress conservatism before Donald Trump begins fully implementing his agenda?

The answer is yes. Without a doubt, yes."

Williams explains, “Unless you can get a good healthy consumer, you are not going to get a good healthy economy. It’s that simple. I think the Fed recognizes that, but they want to get rates higher because that will help the banking system. It will help make lending a little easier and start to return the system to normal. The problem with them backtracking now is the Fed may not ever be able to go back and do what they did before. We may be entering a period of perpetual quantitative easing (money printing). That changes the ballgame, and I am not sure where that’s going to go. It’s not as happy as it would have been if we had gone through a transition where bad parts of the banking system failed and you rebuilt and had a strong buildup from there with the economy and everything else. . . . Perpetual quantitative easing (money printing) is frightening, and it’s a new world. No one has ever seen anything quite like this.”

Williams says all his data is showing the economy is already faltering. Williams point out, “If you believe the GDP numbers, the economy has expanded 25% since the Great Recession, but there is no other number that shows that. . . . I have been contending that we are heading into a new recession. What I am looking at in recovery is that the economy has never really recovered. . . . . The Fed raised rates too much in too fast of a period of time. Had they stretched that over a couple of more years instead of trying to get things back to normal in two years, that might have worked better. What they did was effectively crashed the economy.”

Is there going to be a rate cut? What does Williams think the Fed is seeing right now? Williams says, “I think the Fed is seeing the economy is turning down sharply and that they are in bad trouble with the economy. The way (Jay) Powell talked, and he is the Fed Chairman, indicated that.” So, yes, Williams thinks the Fed will cut rates soon.

On top of that, Williams just had a research study where he asked USAWatchdog.com viewers to email him about the economic situation they see in their home towns all across America. A street level view from people in 33 states was sent in, and Williams found, “It varies by state and it varies by region. The point is it is not uniform, and if you look at the responses, we had most that came in were negative. It was roughly 2.7 negative to one positive.”

So, yet another expert is warning of a slowing economy and money printing to try to fix it all—again. Williams warns, “I can tell you why I would buy gold. You are seeing something here that is extraordinarily dangerous. It doesn’t have a happy ending for the traditional markets. . . . Back when the S&P downgraded the Treasuries, I believe in 2009, Alan Greenspan, who was no longer Fed Chairman at the time but was very vocal, said that was nonsense. He said there was zero risk of the U.S. defaulting on its debt because all the debt the U.S. owes is in dollars. We can print as many dollars that we want, and he’s absolutely correct. . . .The fact that you are making the bonds worthless by devaluing the currency I think is effectively a default, but not a formal default. . . . Greenspan said we can print any number of dollars we need, and that’s exactly what they did to the currency in Venezuela, Zimbabwe and the Weimar Republic. That gives you hyperinflation.”

Grimsson gave a famous reply to the financial MSM reporter, stating that Iceland’s recovery was due to the following primary reason:

„… We were wise enough not to follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies of the Western financial world in the last 30 years. We introduced currency controls, we let the banks fail, we provided support for the poor, and we didn’t introduce austerity measures like you’re seeing here in Europe. …“

When asked whether Iceland’s policy of letting the banks fail would have worked in the rest of Europe, Grimsson replied:

„… Why are the banks considered to be the holy churches of the modern economy? Why are private banks not like airlines and tele-communication companies and allowed to go bankrupt if they have been run in an irresponsible way? The theory that you have to bail-out banks is a theory that you allow bankers enjoy for their own profit their success, and then let ordinary people bear their failure through taxes and austerity. People in enlightened democracies are not going to accept that in the long run. …“

 The Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) mission will be the first satellite dedicated to studying this enigmatic phenomenon. Due to launch in late 2006, it should reveal whether the clouds are caused by global warming, as many scientists believe.

 

 ""Noctilucent"" clouds, which glow at night, form in the upper atmosphere, at an altitude of about 80 kilometres, and their glow can be seen just after sunset or just before sunrise. 

 

 ""Even though the Sun's gone down and you're in darkness, the clouds are so high up, the Sun is still illuminating them,"" explains AIM principal investigator James Russell at Hampton University in Virginia, US. Russell described the mission on Thursday at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore, Maryland, US.

 

 

 Bigger and brighter

 

 The clouds were first observed above polar regions in 1885 – suggesting they may have been caused by the eruption of Krakatoa two years before. But they have spread to latitudes as low as 40° in recent years. ""They're also getting brighter, and each year there are more of them than in the previous year,"" Russell told New Scientist. 

 

 Many researchers believe this proliferation is down to human activities. ""You need three things for clouds to form: particles that water can condense onto; water; and cold temperatures,"" says Russell. He says pollution and global warming are thought to be responsible for two of those factors.

 

 Atmospheric water may be boosted by livestock farming and the burning of fossil fuels, which spew methane into the atmosphere: sunlight breaks down the methane, releasing hydrogen that can bond with oxygen to form water.

 

 And greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide actually help to cool the upper atmosphere, where the clouds form. That is because the atmospheric density is so low at that altitude that the gases cannot trap heat as they do closer to the Earth's surface, and the heat is simply radiated into space.

 

 

 Alien ice

 

 As yet, it is not clear what the source of the particles that ""seed"" the clouds is. The clouds form during the local summer months, when the pole is bathed in perpetual sunlight. So one possibility is that warm air rising above the pole could carry dust upwards from lower atmospheric altitudes, onto which water can condense.

 

 But the dust could also have a cosmic source, dropping into the atmosphere from space. ""It may be there's a constant supply of particles but a changing temperature and water environment makes the conditions right to grow ice particles,"" says Russell. 

 

 AIM will use three instruments to study the clouds. One is a suite of four cameras that will provide panoramic views of the poles and clouds. Another, called the Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE), will study the chemistry of the ice particles and clouds – measuring molecules such as methane. It will also observe the Sun through the atmosphere to measure how much sunlight is dimmed by dust in the atmosphere.

 

 The third instrument, called the Cosmic Dust Experiment, is a plastic film that sits on top of the spacecraft. It will record every ""hit"" from a dust particle that rains down on it from space. 

 

 

 Cloud umbrella

 

 ""We want to know why the clouds form and why they vary,"" says Russell. ""If there is a human connection, it'll tell us that we're doing something to the atmosphere and that we need to determine what the long-term consequences are.""

 

 Some scientists speculate that the clouds might actually help mitigate global warming, says Russell. ""If these clouds were to continue to grow and cover broad areas of Earth, they would form something like a thin, semi-transparent umbrella,"" he told New Scientist. ""They would reduce the amount of solar rays making it to the ground, so they could actually reduce the effects of global warming.""

 

 The AIM satellite will launch into a polar orbit from California's Vandenburg Air Force Base. Russell says it may lift off in December, but its exact launch date has not been set because mission planners are still working to minimise vibration forces on the spacecraft due to its Pegasus XL launch rocket. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Without question, the Leftist social media behemoths have been working in concert to remove or downgrade conservatives from their platforms in the hope of dominating the political landscape, but a new bill, if passed, would make it much harder for them to continue their censorship.

Last week, GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas introduced legislation aimed at removing current liability protections from Big Tech while forcing them to pay a price — literally — for their bias.

“It is time for social media companies to be liable for any biased and unethical impropriety of their employees as any other media company,” Gohmert noted in a statement. “If these companies want to continue to act like a biased medium and publish their own agendas to the detriment of others, they need to be held accountable.”

The Texas Republican’s bill, H.R.7363, amends Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 to prevent the social media platforms from hindering “the display of user-generated content” by censorship or other means. If platforms are found to be hiding or downgrading certain content, they could be held legally and financially liable.

Studies have found that conservative content especially has been purposely hidden or otherwise banned from news feeds and other displays on sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Google. As reported by The Gateway Pundit, one site — The Western Journal, a conservative site — has lost some 75 percent of its Facebook traffic since 2016. Another site, 100PercentFedUp, owned by Klicked Media, has lost similar amounts of traffic from social media, especially Facebook.

“We lost 70 percent to 80 percent of our traffic if you compare January to May 2017 vs Jan to May 2018,” said Klicked Media owner Jared Vallorani, in an interview with The Gateway Pundit.

Also, several notable conservative figures and websites have been banned completely from these platforms, though Left-leaning sites and figures have not, despite committing violations of the platforms’ community standards.

Facebook has also deleted prominent conservatives completely from their platform. Alex Jones, Infowars, Laura Loomer, Gavin McInnes, triple-amputee veteran Brian Kolfage and Roger Stone have lost their pages in the last year.

Gohmert noted that social media platforms like Twitter, Google, and Facebook “are now among the largest and most powerful companies in the world.” He also said that more and more people are getting their news from those social media platforms, which has made them even more influential and powerful than “traditional media outlets.” (Related: WOW: Louie Gohmert says watchdog found that Hillary’s emails went to ‘FOREIGN ENTITY’ and Strzok did nothing.)

“And yet,” he continued, “social media companies enjoy special legal protections” under the Communications Act of 1934, which traditional press outlets do not have.

“Instead of acting like the neutral platforms they claim to be in order to obtain their immunity, these companies have turned [the law] into a license to potentially defraud and defame with impunity,” Gohmert added.

The Texas lawmaker said that representatives of social media companies have appeared before Congress claiming that their platforms do not discriminate against conservative figures or voices. And yet, right-leaning news and information sources continue to report declines in social media traffic, though Left-leaning sites do not.

In addition, “employees from some of these companies have communicated their digits for conservatives and discussed ways to use social media platforms and algorithms to silence and prevent income to conservatives,” Gohmert added.

In January, NewsTarget reported that Twitter employees were busted by James O’Keefe and his undercover media sting operation Project Veritas discussing the development of algorithms that use “machine learning,” keywords and other techniques to perform “shadow bans” on conservative sites.

“In one hearing, one of the internet social media executives indicated a desire to be treated like Fox News. Fox News does not have their immunity and this bill will fulfill that unwitting request,” Gohmert said.

A group called Demand Justice (DJ) has popped up on the scene—armed with oodles of funding derived mostly from internationalist multi-billionaire seditionist George Soros. DJ’s goal is to taint public discourse and stop Congress from confirming President Donald Trump’s latest Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh, a well-qualified former D.C. circuit judge, pledged not to legislate from the bench and said he will rule according to an “originalist” interpretation of the Constitution, in keeping with the objective textual meaning established by the nation’s framers.

This gives hardened leftists like those in DJ a rather severe case of the ideological jitters, since “progress” from a leftist-progressive viewpoint requires a judiciary that will subjectively read things into the Constitution that simply aren’t there. Absent an activist court, some of the left’s most sacred cows, such as unfettered access to abortion—especially since confirming Kavanaugh evidently would create the most conservative-leaning Supreme Court in history—would be at risk of being gored.

DJ, organized and financed by a 501(c)(4) named the Sixteen Thirty Fund, was formed this past spring. The Open Society Policy Center (OSPC), one of Soros’s primary donation vehicles, contributed about $2.2 million to the Sixteen Thirty Fund between 2012 and 2016 according to documents posted by “DailyCaller.com.” The fund has financial statements on file that show just three contributors accounted for 70%—or about $11.5 million—of the fund’s total donations and grant revenue. Disclosure forms filed in 2016 present similar facts.

According to the OSPC’s tax forms, the Soros group “gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the [Sixteen Thirty Fund] each year between 2012 and 2016, the last year in which records are publicly accessible. The [OSPC] gave the fund $350,000 in 2012; $772,000 in 2013; $125,000 in 2014; $550,000 in 2015; and $481,483 in 2016,” the news website “DailyCaller.com” noted.

As if Soros’s money isn’t enough of a problem, DJ’s staffers include alumni from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and from the Obama administration—strongly indicating that the deranged former secretary of state and her former White House boss simply won’t accept her 2016 loss and are working through DJ to upset Trump’s agenda in the judicial arena. Accordingly, DJ reportedly plans to put $5 million behind a multi-platform effort to stop Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Television ads will promote embattled Democratic Senate incumbents in Indiana, North Dakota, and West Virginia who face competitive Republican challengers this November.

DJ also will run ads in Alaska and Maine, urging GOP Senators Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins to oppose Kavanaugh, because Collins and Murkowski have parted ways with their party on the Obamacare federal health-insurance repeal as well as federal funding for abortion provider and accused baby-parts peddler Planned Parenthood.

The TV spots will “urge the senators to protect abortion access by withholding support for nominees [like Kavanaugh] who oppose the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision,” “DailyCaller.com” added."

Coronavirus lockdowns have failed to alter the course of the pandemic but have instead ‘destroyed millions of livelihoods’, a JP Morgan study has claimed.

Falling infection rates since lockdowns were lifted suggest that the virus ‘likely has its own dynamics’ which are ‘unrelated to often inconsistent lockdown measures’, a report published by the financial services giant said.

Denmark is among the countries which has seen its R rate continue to fall after schools and shopping malls re-opened, while Germany’s rate has mostly remained below 1.0 after the lockdown was eased.

The report also shows many US states including Alabama, Wisconsin and Colorado enjoying lower R rates after lockdown measures were lifted.

Author Marko Kolanovic, a trained physicist and a strategist for JP Morgan, said governments had been spooked by ‘flawed scientific papers’ into imposing lockdowns which were ‘inefficient or late’ and had little effect.

‘Unlike rigorous testing of new drugs, lockdowns were administered with little consideration that they might not only cause economic devastation but potentially more deaths than Covid-19 itself,’ he claimed.

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera warned on Tuesday that the country would experience its “greatest health challenge in decades” following a spike in new coronavirus cases across the region. As of late Thursday, the country has a total caseload of 37,040 and 368 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

In the capital city of Santiago, Health Minister Jaime Manalich announced a general quarantine to head off new cases. The “extraordinary, tough new measures” will take effect Friday. The quarantine will also cover people over 75 years of age in the country.

“The month of May is proving very tough on our country,” he added. The health minister reported that there were over 2,600 new coronavirus cases in the past two days – a 60-percent increase from the start of the week.

The cordon sanitaire will also include the regions surrounding the 6.5 million-strong city. According to local authorities, the edict comes on the heels of a wave of new cases in wealthier parts of Santiago. The coronavirus was first identified among residents returning from trips to Italy and Asia.

Manalich pleaded with residents to take the new measures seriously, and report anyone violating the general quarantine.

“In reality, the battle for Santiago is THE crucial battle in the war against coronavirus,” he said, adding that the government has done over 313,750 tests, to date.

The minister also sought to allay fears that the country’s health system is on the brink of collapse, saying that patients and essential equipment have been transferred to potential hotspots.

“We don’t fear a collapse but in the event that these actions we’re taking work and are respected,” Manalich stated. “We need the commitment of every citizen, to understands what is at play here and respect all the measures so we don’t face a collapse in the system because of a vertiginous increase in cases.”

The city is also preparing for the increase in coronavirus-related fatalities that come with a spike in new cases. Local authorities have said that thousands of fresh graves are being dug in Santiago’s General Cemetery.

“We realize that this is a historical moment and that we may need more graves, because we see what’s happened in other countries,” cemetery director Rashid Saud told AFP.

To cope with the potential rise in deaths, Saud said that gravediggers were preparing 2,000 fresh graves. Unlike other countries, which have resorted to mass graves to take in dead people and rotting corpses en masse, the individual graves were dug in advance, and in hopes that “[they] will not have to use them.”

But according to Luis Yevenes, the head of the cemetery workers’ union, the situation in other Chilean cities is far different than that of Santiago. In particular, he expressed his concern about the lack of capacity in cemeteries in Valparaiso and Vina del Mar in the center, and the cities of Concepcion and Talcahuano farther south.

Meanwhile, both Brazil and Mexico – whose presidents have been pushing to reopen their economies – reported a record one-day rise in new coronavirus cases on Thursday.

Brazil, the hardest-hit country in Latin America, reported 13,944 new cases to bring its total caseload to 203,165, with 13,999 deaths, while Mexico reported 2,409 new infections to bring its total confirmed cases to 42,595, with 4,477 deaths.

Brazil registered a daily record of 13,944 new cases. This brings its total to 202,918 confirmed cases of the virus and 13,933 deaths since the outbreak began, according to health ministry data. However, President Jair Bolsonaro continued to downplay the impact of the pandemic and has pushed for lifting the lockdown in Sao Paolo.

Mexico reported 2,409 new infections, bringing its total confirmed COVID-19 cases to 42,595. An additional 257 coronavirus deaths brought total fatalities to 4,477. (Related: Mexico now cremating the dead on an “industrial scale” as the coronavirus pandemic reaches “staggering” number of fatalities… all covered up, China-style.)

“We are in the most difficult moment of the first wave of the epidemic,” explained Hugo Lopez-Gatell, who heads Mexico’s coronavirus response. The deputy health minister also warned that the country was still at the peak of its pandemic cycle, with government data showing over half of the hospitals in Mexico City were saturated with coronavirus patients.

589,True,The article suggests that there is a conspiracy to promote mandatory vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and that the media is conditioning people to accept it.,True,"The article mentions the Association for Canadian Studies, Leger, the Canadian government, Christian Bourque, and the Health Ranger as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,The article mentions that the Canadian government has contributed money towards finding and developing a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and that there is a push for mandatory vaccination.,False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,The article connects the belief in mandatory vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to the belief in abortion rights and suggests a pattern of inconsistency.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead.,"The Association for Canadian Studies along with a group known as Leger recently conducted a poll about whether or not a future vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) should be mandatory. And the majority of respondents disturbingly said yes.

A shocking 60 percent of the Canadians polled, many of whom likely claim my body, my choice! when it comes to abortion “rights,” apparently believe that it should not be your body and your choice when it comes to getting jabbed with a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

The other 40 percent of respondents – and the poll could have been skewed, it is important to note – stated that any vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) should be voluntary rather than compulsory.

Recognizing that far too many Canadians are on board with mandatory vaccination, the Canadian government has already contributed tens of millions of taxpayer dollars towards finding and developing a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which the government says has infected nearly 50,000 Canadians and killed almost 3,000.

Interestingly, the 60 percent of respondents who said they support mandatory Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines for other people indicated that they would not necessarily want to get the vaccine themselves.

“It’s almost as if it’s seen as just another flu vaccine,” lamented Christian Bourque, executive vice president of Leger, who believes that all Canadians should be in support of mandatory vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

“I myself would have expected a higher number given the severity, given the crisis we’re in,” he added. “But Canadians are kind of divided on this.”

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Paul Cottrell about how forced vaccinations and other forms of medical tyranny are spreading across America as well:

All that being said, this was an internet poll

Since this poll was conducted on the internet, it admittedly is not a random sample and thus cannot be considered a reliable indicator of what the average Canadian thinks about this pandemic and the vaccine response to it. At the same time, it does suggest that there are, in fact, a sizeable number of people out there who see nothing wrong with compulsory “medicine” for the “greater good.”

While common sense would dictate that forcing people to receive medical “treatments” that come with serious risks is never a good idea, this health freedom ethos apparently goes out the window for a lot of people once outbreak or pandemic fears come into play.

In this case, mass hysteria over the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is driving some to call for forced jabs as the “cure.” Even if forcing you and your children to get jabbed results in death, the mandatory vaxxers will still push for it as the “solution” to this pandemic.

As it turns out, conservatives tend to lean towards health freedom while liberals are generally more supportive of requiring that others take vaccinations, at gunpoint if necessary, to supposedly protect other human life. And yet when it comes to protecting the lives of the unborn, these same liberals turn a blind eye or even celebrate abortion as a “woman’s choice.”

“I strongly doubt that 60% of Canadians approve of mandatory vaccination for coronavirus,” wrote one skeptical Global News commenter. “This feels like MSM (mainstream media) conditioning us little by little into accepting mandatory vaccinations, in addition to the ‘contact tracing’ propaganda that’s also going on.”

“THEY are whipping up fear as means of obtaining our compliance for their total control agenda,” this same commenter added.

• the message was “biting” (remember this is an information war, not a tv reality show – be pithy and punchy)
• no harm to humans or animals was caused in its production.

Hello from Germany. Listening to you on youtube whenever you got news for us. I still have a serious question in regard to you highly estimating Donald Trump’s actions. How can it be that a man who is so deeply in love with his people just now signed an executive order involving the military in the production of vaccines? Vaccines as a military weapon to be applied on Americans putting up with all the disastrous results that are officially known. Why does he support this war on his people?

.

 Our reply: We oppose dangerous vaccines and any order, regulation, and/or law that permits the government to forcefully enter our bloodstream and inject foreign substances, which we all know have contained FETAL tissue. That would mean that we are all chattle – no more than herds of cows that must be prodded, poked, and injected by their masters. It would also make the recipients of these tainted vaccines – cannibals.

Who is advising the president on these matters? SES? British Loyalists? Bill and Melinda Gates? Big Pharma?

The bloodstream is sacred and so is human life.

A research dossier compiled by the so-called “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance, that reportedly concludes China intentionally hid or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus pandemic, is consistent with U.S. findings about the origins of the outbreak so far, senior U.S. officials told Fox News on Saturday.

The 15-page document from the intelligence agencies of the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand, was obtained by Australia’s Saturday Telegraph newspaper and finds that China’s secrecy amounted to an “assault on international transparency.”

The dossier, which is likely to further increase pressure on the Chinese government to explain its actions and early statements, points to the initial denial by the government that the virus could be transmitted between humans, the silencing of doctors, destruction of evidence, and a refusal to provide samples to scientists working on a vaccine.



 Trump recently confirmed to the press that the covid-19 virus emerged from a lab in Wuhan, China, and shames the W.H.O. for being press agents for the ChiComs.

While U.S. intelligence is not confirming the existence of the 15-page document, a senior official told Fox that reports of the document aligns with U.S. intelligence that China knew the spread between humans earlier than it said, that it knew it was a novel coronavirus earlier than it said and that it was spread wider than they reported to the international community in the first weeks of the outbreak.

 Breaking News: Vladimir Putin Speaks Out against GeoEngineering and Chemtrails!

 Vladimir Putin has set himself on a collision course with Western governments by criticising their atmospheric spraying operations. According to Putin these operations pose a “monumental threat” to the earth’s biota and are “not only offensive, but against nature.“

Chemtrails

 The secret government has been spraying the skies throughout North America since late 1997 on an almost daily basis with substances that were first identified as “mystery contrails”, but later were dubbed “chemtrails” by investigative reporter and author William Thomas. When questioned, military and government officials either deny any knowledge of these spraying’s outright or they offer unbelievable and ludicrous explanations that only a moron could believe. These spraying’s are making many people sick and are the first phase of a bio-warfare operation designed to effect wide scale population reduction .. What can YOU do and Find out what’s going on: http://ift.tt/Th4EHp

By cooperating in secret with jet fuel manufacturers, government agents have carefully kept the massive chemtrail efforts completely under wraps. Snowden added, “I am only revealing this program because there is no oversight in the scientific community, no public discussion, and little concern for the side-effects which are well known only to a few privileged people interested in continuing the decades-long chemtrail program in secret.”

Because climate change is a threat to U.S. agriculture, it has been labeled a national security issue. With the influence and cooperation of Monsanto, a secret Geoengineering lab dubbed Muad’Dib has been operating since the late 1960s, and the chemtrail program is often referred to by insiders as its “crown jewel.” Muad’Dib has aimed to protect North America’s climate at all costs – The chemtrail program has been incredibly easy to hide, especially with the cooperation of jet fuel companies, a crucial part of the military-industrial complex. Snowden said, “The chemicals which are released by passenger airplanes have been covertly introduced as ‘additives,’ supposedly to improve efficiency. Only as the plane reaches cruising velocity does the heat and atmospheric pressure cause a chemical reaction that synthesizes the top secret carbon-trapping molecule. This process is imperfect, and many of the by-products are incredibly dangerous even in trace quantities. The most dangerous thing is that although chemtrails are keeping the climate of the U.S. reasonably stable, citizens are bombarded every day with an invisible rain of carbon-laden molecules, and the effect on health is totally unknown.”"

And so it begins: YouTube is now adding “fact checks” to videos which question the man-made global warming scare narrative.

YouTube is now adding fact checks to videos that question climate change, BuzzFeed News has confirmed, as a part of its ongoing effort to combat the rampant misinformation and conspiratorial fodder on its platform.

 On July 9, the company added a blurb of text underneath some videos about climate change, which provided a scientifically accurate explainer. The text comes from the Wikipedia entry for global warming and states that “multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming.” This new feature follows YouTube’s announcement in March that it would place descriptions from Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica next to videos on topics that spur conspiracy theories, such as the moon landing and the Oklahoma City bombing. In doing the same for climate videos, the company seems to be wading into more fraught and complex intellectual territory.

Sure, in many ways it’s a trivial and pathetic gesture. Quoting Wikipedia as your credible source is a bit like citing CNN as the go-to site for all the latest info on Donald Trump. And anyway, that “scientifically accurate explainer” is at best vague, at worst far more misleading than the videos it is supposed to be “fact checking.”

So the records show that there has been some gentle warming of less than 1 degree C since the world began emerging from the Little Ice Age a century and a half ago. So what? This whole line of argument is a Straw Man, which wilfully misrepresents the sceptical position. It’s not whether or not climate changes that preoccupies sceptics. It’s whether recent warming is significantly man-made – and if it is, whether, it’s something we should worry about, and whether it’s within our means or in our interest to do anything about it anyway.

But the real issue here, of course, is that like Big Tech’s near-blanket banning of Alex Jones, it’s the thin end of the wedge.

The study was published in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases.
• Natural measles immunity—better protection and more long-term benefits than Vaccines

The PCV13 vaccine has been available since 2012, when it was approved by the FDA. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the PCV13 vaccine for persons aged 19–64 years who have high-risk conditions (mainly anatomical or functional asplenia and immunocompromising conditions) and for all persons 65 years or older (with or without risk conditions).

The medical researchers in Spain conducted the study to determine if the vaccine was effective or not in preventing hospitalization from pneumonia.

The study was a population-based cohort study that looked at over two million people over the age of 50 residing in Catalonia, Spain. They looked at both vaccinated and unvaccinated adults, noting those who were hospitalized for pneumonia and those who died from any cause.

The results of their study concluded that not only did the PCV13 vaccine not reduce the risk of pneumonia, it actually increased the risk among those vaccinated.

The study also found that the mortality rate was 60% higher in the vaccinated population (5,944 per 100,000) than in the unvaccinated population (2,354 per 100,000).

Gabbard challenges the US foreign policy of military violence, the glue that holds the empire together, and she especially condemns regime change war, which has resulted in disaster in Iraq, Libya and Syria. During the interview, she called out the CIA for arming terrorists in Syria, leading Colbert to reveal himself as a tool for the military industrial complex as he tried to shut her down.

Hawaii Congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard recently appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, where instead of the light, jokey banter about politics and who she is as a person that Democratic presidential candidates normally encounter on late night comedy programs, the show’s host solemnly ran down a list of textbook beltway smears against Gabbard and made her defend them in front of his audience.

Normally when a Democratic Party-aligned politician appears on such a show, you can expect jokes about how stupid Trump is and how badly they’re going to beat the Republicans, how they’re going to help ordinary Americans, and maybe some friendly back-and-forth about where they grew up or something. Colbert had no time to waste on such things, however, because this was not an interview with a normal Democratic Party-aligned politician: this was a politician who has been loudly and consistently criticizing US foreign policy.

After briefly asking his guest who she is and why she’s running for president, Colbert jumped right into it by immediately bringing up Syria and Assad, the primary line of attack employed against Gabbard by establishment propagandists in American mainstream media.

Colbert: Do you think the Iraq war was worth it? Colbert: Do you think that our involvement in Syria has been worth it? Colbert: Do you think that ISIS could have been defeated without our involvement and without our support of the local troops there? Gabbard: There are two things we need to address in Syria. One is a regime change war that was first launched by the United States in 2011, covertly, led by the CIA. That is a regime change war that has continued over the years, that has increased the suffering of the Syrian people, and strengthened groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS, because the CIA was using American taxpayer dollars to provide arms and training and equipment to these terrorist groups to get them to overthrow the government. So that is a regime change war that we should not have been engaging. Colbert: So, but if it is someone like Bashar al-Assad, who gasses his own people, or who engages in war crimes against his own people, should the United States not be involved? Gabbard: The United States should not be intervening to overthrow these dictators and these regimes that we don’t like, like Assad, like Saddam Hussein, like Gaddafi, and like Kim Jong Un. There are bad people in the world, but history has shown us that every time the United States goes in and topples these dictators we don’t like, trying to end up like the world’s police, we end up increasing the suffering of the people in these countries. We end up increasing the loss of life, but American lives and the lives of people in these countries. We end up undermining our own security, what to speak of the trillions of dollars of taxpayer money that’s spent on these wars that we need to be using right here at home.

Like I said, this is not a normal presidential candidate. How often do you see a guest appear on a network late night talk show and talk about the CIA arming terrorists in Syria and the fact that US military interventionism is completely disastrous? It just doesn’t happen. You can understand, then, why empire propagandist Stephen Colbert spent the rest of the interview informing his TV audience that Tulsi Gabbard is dangerous and poisonous."

Closing schools for eight weeks or more may have a greater impact on mitigating the spread of the novel coronavirus than two- to four-week closures, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.

Shorter-term closures will likely make little difference in the spread of the disease, new CDC guidance states, even as K-12 school districts across the country began announcing school closures within the shorter time frame.

Closing schools also comes with its own setbacks, namely a potentially negative impact on academic outcomes, which the CDC also acknowledged in its updated guidelines.

The Department of Education recently issued its own guidance to educators about its flexibility related to student absences and testing standards.

In any school closure, students could still congregate outside of school and spread the disease, the CDC acknowledged.

Other mitigation efforts, including handwashing and home isolation, “have more impact on (the) spread of disease,” the new CDC guidance states."

'The downstream health effects are being massively under-estimated'

Over 600 doctors have warned President Donald Trump in a signed a letter urging him to end the ""national shutdown,"" which has been in place for months to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The doctors described the widespread state lockdown orders as a ""mass casualty incident"" with ""exponentially growing health consequences.""

The letter highlights a series of consequences, which include missing routine checkups for heart problems, cancer, increases in substance abuse, and financial instability leading to ""[p]overty and financial uncertainty.""

""We are alarmed at what appears to be the lack of consideration for the future health of our patients,"" the doctors say in their letter.

""The downstream health effects ... are being massively under-estimated and under-reported. This is an order of magnitude error.""

""The millions of casualties of a continued shutdown will be hiding in plain sight, but they will be called alcoholism, homelessness, suicide, heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure.""

""In youths it will be called financial instability, unemployment, despair, drug addiction, unplanned pregnancies, poverty, and abuse.""

""Because the harm is diffuse, there are those who hold that it does not exist. We, the undersigned, know otherwise.""

Dr. Mark McDonald, a psychiatrist, noted one of his patients suffering from depression died about two weeks ago of a fentanyl overdose.

He blames the government-imposed shutdown for the patient's death.

""She had to stay in her apartment, essentially in house arrest as most people here in [Los Angeles] were for weeks and weeks, she could not see her therapist -- she could speak to the therapist over the phone, but she couldn't see her in person,"" McDonald said.

""She could not attend any of her group meetings, which we're helping to maintain her abstinence from opiates ... and she relapsed into depression.""

""She was just too withdrawn to ask for help,"" McDonald continued.

""She was simply trying to escape from her pain... I do blame these actions by the government for her death.""

The news comes as many Democratic State Governors are threatening citizens with jail for defying lockdown orders.

Last week, A group of doctors had filed a lawsuit against Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, arguing there are no medical grounds for her lockdown measures.

The coalition of Michigan health practices argued the lockdown is “risking lives and imperiling health.”

The lawsuit was filed against Whitmer, State Attorney General Dana Nessel, and state health director Robert Gordon.

That filing the case included Wellston Medical Center, Primary Health Services, Jeffery Gulick, and the owners of Grand Health Partners.

Last month, a group of California doctors called on governments to lift lockdown citing a pending ""public health crisis.""

ER doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi of Accelerated Urgent Care argued government lockdown measures are having a reverse impact.

The group insisted the shut down was not an appropriate reaction to what current data shows about COVID-19, but the measures are instead causing measurable public health issues."

Khan, who Trump branded yesterday as a 'stone cold loser,' accused the president of 'amplifying racists' on Twitter.

""Surely the UK should be saying to Trump 'listen, you're a poster boy for the far right movement around the world',"" Khan told Sky News.

He added Britain should be telling Trump he ""made a mistake from walking away from the Paris Climate Change agreement.""

When Khan was asked why he wasn't at the state banquet and why he continued to criticize Trump on his state visit, he replied:

""there should be a state banquet, and there shouldn't be a rolling out of the red carpet, that's an honor bestowed on very few presidents.""

The London mayor was then immediately corrected by the interviewer who reminded that Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Barack Obama all enjoyed state visits.

""I can't be silent when the president of the free world is defending neo-nazis and white supremacists,"" Khan said.

""I think in years to come we're going to regret giving this state visit to Donald Trump,"" The mayor concluded.

Yesterday, Khan accused Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and national populist leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Italy’s Matteo Salvini of imitating “20th-century fascists”.

Khan accused Trump of using “xenophobia, racism and ‘otherness’ as an electoral tactic.""

He then compared the president's actions to “the actions of European dictators of the 1930s and 40s… the military juntas of the 1970s and 80s… Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un,"" in his article in the Observer.

Trump said Khan's attempt at leading London was “terrible,' before saying he has been foolish and “stone-cold loser,” and was much like the “very dumb and incompetent” New York Mayor de Blasio.

Trump stated Khan’s campaign to sour the relationship with the U.S had been for nothing."

The host went into full 'Russia collusion' mode, accusing Trump of having Putin as his ""running mate.""

""That sounds like the description of a bad Hollywood screenplay, but it is real,"" he stated.

""It is Vladimir Putin’s greatest achievement, decades after America’s victory in the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union, the president of the United States is now helping the president of Russia help the president of the United States to get re-elected,"" he added.

""So that the president of Russia will have four more years of the president of the United States who he wants in the Oval Office, this is one of those shocking news days if you retain the capacity to be shocked in the Trump era by the Trump regime, which might be better labeled the Trump-Putin regime.”

On the subject of Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's replacement, Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, O’Donnell continued:

“Donald Trump is operating in the White House in conjunction with Vladimir Putin to hide what Vladimir Putin is doing to help Donald Trump get re-elected.""

""Donald Trump is a Russian operative — if tonight’s reporting by The Washington Post and The New York Times is true. And everything else we know about Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin indicates that it is true.”

“This is a darkly momentous event in the history of this country in the history of this world. Vladimir Putin has become Donald Trump’s running mate once again.”

Pelosi said members should condemn any efforts to undermine the intelligence community.

""American voters should decide American elections — not Vladimir Putin. All Members of Congress should condemn the president’s reported efforts to dismiss threats to the integrity of our democracy & to politicize our intel community.""

""We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections. If reports are true and the president is interfering with that, he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling. Exactly as we warned, he would do."""
602,True,"The article suggests that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was brought in by the New World Order puppet George Bush Sr. and implemented by Bill Clinton, implying a conspiracy by powerful actors to implement the agreement.",True,"The article mentions powerful actors such as the New World Order, George Bush Sr., and Bill Clinton, who are framed as responsible for implementing NAFTA.",True,"The article mentions actions such as the implementation of NAFTA, the creation of trade imbalances, and the incentivization of free trade agreements by the US government.",True,"The article mentions threats such as the gutting of manufacturing jobs in America, the expansion of the lower class, the decimation of Mexico's agricultural economy, and the push of American workers out of the market.",True,"The article connects events and observations by attributing cause and effect, such as the connection between NAFTA and the loss of jobs in the US and Mexico, the increase in poverty and organized crime in Mexico, and the trade imbalance favoring China.",False,The article does not mention any attempts by actors to mislead the public or cover up their actions.,"Jake Morphonios gives an excellent presentation on how so-called free trade agreements gutted manufacturing in America almost overnight, as jobs were transferred overseas. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was brought in by New World Order puppet George Bush Sr. in the 1990s, and implemented by Bill Clinton. Prior to this, America enjoyed a trade surplus, as other nations were buying more US products than we bought from them, which solidified the American middle class.

Trade imbalances are bad for countries on the losing side because that means their money is going into a foreign economy. NAFTA, a globalist scheme, created massive trade imbalances that hurt the US, yet the US government incentivizes it. Free trade agreements take the power out of the hands of the people and funnels it up to the sociopaths at the top of the pyramid.

While the American middle class is shrinking, the lower class is expanding- half of Americans are using some form of government assistance. While leftists promote socialism as the cure, Republicans defend corrupt corporations. Neither party is pursuing a free market solution based on ethics.

NAFTA has not only killed jobs in the US, but it has also decimated Mexico’s agricultural economy. For example, NAFTA allowed multi-national corporations to dump huge amounts of corn grown in the US into the Mexican market at below-market prices, undercutting Mexican farmers. It is more expensive to grow corn in the US, so American taxpayers were forced to subsidize the corporations who blew out the Mexican market. As a result, Mexican farmers lost their jobs and and immigrated in large numbers to the US. Mexican immigrants provide a cheap labor pool, and are pushing American workers out of the market.

Over 2 million Mexicans farmers were put out of work, which led to 500,000 low skilled workers immigrating to the US every year since NAFTA was enacted. Mass unemployment in Mexico caused poverty to skyrocket, which led to a huge spike in organized crime. Cartel crime, human trafficking and the drug industry all started with NAFTA.

The same tactic is being used against the US, which is being plundered by China as the free trade agreements have created a trade imbalance favoring China, which receives big breaks on shipping costs. The US is surviving only because there is cheap debt issued by the Federal Reserve.

US investors and corporate officers are making a killing, but average middle class Americans are being killed. Jake says that Trump is wrong to renegotiate NAFTA, and that the proper solution is to withdraw from the treaty. The problem is not capitalism, but rather laws that create monopolies."

It also mentions the discovery of contaminated vaccines and the subsequent exposure of sterilization efforts. These elements imply secrecy.,"Elites that pushed vaccines on the planet met in 2009 to “curb overpopulation.”

The U.S. Government’s 1974 National Security Study Memorandum 200 called for funding “injectable contraceptives” to target the third world.

Human rights activist Matthew McDaniel witnessed the effect of these “tainted” vaccines first hand in Thailand.

According to the local population of the Akha, pregnant women are forced to receive vaccines in order to get ID cards for their children. The vaccine, specifically tetanus shots laced with hcg, often results with miscarriage when given to pregnant women. In the video below, Matthew McDaniel speaks with two Akha women about the forced Tetanus vaccine and the resulting miscarriages:

In 1989 research was conducted by the National Institute of Immunology in New Delhi India on the use of ‘carriers’ such as Tetanus Toxoid and Diphtheria to bypass the immune system and deliver the female hormone called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The research paper was carried in the Oxford University Press in 1990 and was titled “Bypass by an alternate ‘carrier’ of acquired unresponsiveness to hCG upon repeated immunization with tetanus-conjugated vaccine.”

By delivering hCG within a Tetanus vaccine – which acts as the carrier – the human body treats hCG as an intruder and creates antibodies against it. This has the effect of sterilizing women who receive the vaccine, and in many cases miscarriage when given during pregnancy.

Soon after anti-fertility vaccines were successfully developed, hCG containing Tetanus vaccines were deployed across multiple third-world countries. Many of these countries were specifically targeted in the NSSM 200 document for population reduction.

In the aftermath of widespread covert use of anti-fertility vaccines, the BBC aired a documentary titled “The Human Laboratory” in 1995 (transcript available here). The discovery of “contaminated” Tetanus toxoid vaccines and the resulting sterilization of Philippine women was exposed.

In 1996 the Rockefeller Foundation supplied grant money for early research on edible vaccines. The $58,000 grant, given to the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University, was aimed at developing and transferring edible vaccine technology to developing countries. Cornell University reported:

“BTI researchers are developing genetically changed foods that are grown with the vaccine already in them as a cheap and easy way to deliver vaccines to children throughout the world. For example, the BTI researchers are working on genetically installing some oral vaccines into bananas“.

Dr. Charles Arntzen, one of the head scientists behind edible vaccines, joked during a discussion panel at Arizona State University in 2012that genetic engineering should be used to create a virus to depopulate the planet. Arntzen said:

“Has anybody seen ‘Contagion’? That’s the answer! Go out and use genetic engineering to create a better virus… 25 percent of the population is supposed to go in Contagion.”

During the H1N1 scare in 2009, government officials in Germany received a “safer” vaccine thought to have fewer side effects.

This 1997 documentary from CNBC exposed the link between the Polio vaccine – which was tainted with the SV40 monkey virus – and rare cancers like mesothelioma and childhood cancers.

Sir Chris Patten, as Oxford chancellor and advisor to the Rhodes Trust, is a prima facie member of the Pilgrims Society. He is a director of the International Crisis Group (ICG) founded by George Soros, with directors including Larry Summers (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Economic Council), Sheryl Sandburg (Gmail, Facebook, Instagram), Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, Gen. Wesley Clark.

Patten is therefore associated with Malloch-Brown’s well-known UN election rigging program Optech and Smartmatic. Batten helps direct BBC propaganda for the Pilgrims Society as a BBC director.

Patten is a founder of the Oxford Russia Fund that includes director Igor Yurgens. In 2005, Yurgens became a vice president of Renaissance Capital Group. Renaissance directed the financing of Uranium One and paid Bill Clinton $500K as a part of the Uranium One deal.

Therefore, this proves sedition among the American participants in this conspiracy of relationships.

Note from AIM patriot David who points out:

He was advising Renaissance Capital too when they paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for his Moscow speech, and Renaissance was one of the market makers for UrAsia (Frank Giustra – Clinton Foundation) sale to URANIUM ONE.

America urged Saddam Hussein to attack Hafez al-Assad’s Syria because of the closure of Iraq’s oil pipeline, a secret 1983 intelligence report has revealed.

A report, by former senior CIA official Graham Fuller, said the US should consider ‘urging Iraq to take the war to Syria’, noting that Saddam was ‘fighting for his life’ in the Iran-Iraq campaign.

Through the closure of the pipeline, Mr Fuller said Syria had a ‘hammerlock’ on US interests in both Lebanon and in the Gulf.

With that being the case, he said the US should consider ‘sharply escalating the pressures against Assad’ from three border states hostile to Syria – Iraq, Israel and Turkey.

Faced with ‘three belligerent fronts’, Assad would probably be forced to abandon his closure of the pipeline, the report claimed.

It hoped it could convince Iraq to co-operate as the closure of the pipeline had brought the country ‘to its financial knees’, impelling it towards dangerous internationalization of the war in the Gulf.

It noted that Iraq might not ‘readily wish’ another campaign but said Syria was already fighting a one-front war in Lebanon and could ‘ill-afford to broaden’ its conflict.

It also said Syria was struggling to keep control over a population that detested the Assad regime.

It went on to say Iraq had enough military airpower to devote up to one half of its air force against Syria.

By demanding the reopening of the pipeline, Iraq would have the support of ‘virtually every Arab state, except Libya’, the report said.

The report added that if the US wanted to ‘rein in Syria’ it needed to do so by showing ‘real muscle’ and highlighted the need to strike a ‘sharp blow’ to Syria’s prestige.

Elsewhere, the report stated that Israel should ‘welcome the chance to humble Assad’ by raising tensions among Syria’s Lebanon front without actually going to war. It said Assad was now Israel’s greatest problem, not Iraq.

Lastly, it said that Turkey, angered by Syrian support to Armenian terrorism, to Iraqi Kurds and to Turkish terrorists operating out of northern Syria, had often considered launching unilateral military operations against terrorist camps in northern Syria.

It said the use of all three states was essential to enacting change and forcing Assad to back down.

Bringing in Iraq, it said, was the most challenging aspect of the plan. To do so could only be done by a ‘reorientation of US policy towards Iraq’ and might include ‘more active US participation in supplying high-tech items’ to Iraq’s modernization efforts. It concluded by saying that the US might need to give more support to Iraq in the war against Iran. The Iraq-Iran war started on September 22, 1980 and did not end for eight years. Saddam had invaded because of a territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab, the waterway which formed the boundary between the two countries. He also felt threatened by the Islamic revolution which had brought Ayatollah Khomeini to power in Iran the year before. But they viewed Saddam as a brutal tyrant and he underestimated their devotion to their new leader. The war finally ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire which was accepted by both sides."

Trouble may be brewing for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as new cracks are emerging in the Democrats' stronghold over the House of Representatives.

During the hype surrounding Joe Biden's Super Tuesday victory over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) in the Democratic primaries, a potential ticking timebomb for the Democrats was revealed in California.

And it could signal problems for the future of Pelosi's speakership in the House.

The CA primaries revealed that nine seats currently held by Democrats in the state are looking vulnerable enough that the GOP may be able to take them.

As J.D. Rucker notes at NOQ Report, it's important to keep in mind that ""these aren’t nine seats that are deemed 'in play' through some election miracle.

""These are nine seats currently held by Democrats where Republicans have the upper hand based on analysis of Tuesday’s primary votes.""

Secondly, Rucker says it ""is very important to understand"" that ""with only one statewide ballot measure, the main draw was the Democratic presidential primary in which Republicans may not vote.

""That means that even without the draw of a presidential primary choice, nine seats showed Republicans either within striking distance or outright beating Democrats.""

The San Francisco Chronicle reported, “Republicans took a strong first step in the primary election toward grabbing back at least some of the seven California congressional districts that Democrats flipped in 2018.

""With millions of late-arriving mail ballots still uncounted from Tuesday’s election, Republicans have so far combined for a majority of the votes in six of those seven districts.

""GOP candidates have solid leads in two of them.”

The Chronicle noted, “In Orange County, GOP candidates were winning a majority of the votes in three of the four targeted districts.”

Fred Whitaker, chairman of the Orange County GOP, stated, “On Tuesday night, the waters of the blue wave began to recede … and Republicans showed that we will take back Orange County.

""The pathway to restoring the House of Representatives is through Orange County.”

Here was the data at the time of Rucker’s post on Wednesday, according to The Daily Wire:

District 7: Although incumbent Ami Berra garnered 44.5% of the total votes cast, and his Democratic challenger Jeff Burdick gained 6.6%, their total was not significantly ahead of the total of GOP candidates Buzz Patterson (38.9%) and Jon Ivy (7.8%), and that was with a heavy turnout for the Democratic presidential primary.

Rucker noted of Patterson, a former carrier of the “nuclear football” for President Clinton and former Air Force Lt. Colonel, “If he can get some wind on his back, he has a strong chance of flipping the seat and beating the incumbent.”

District 10: With 58% of precincts reporting, Dem Josh Harder had 38.9% of the vote; GOP candidate Ted Howze had 38.2%.

GOP candidates had a total of 56.3% of the vote.

District 16: Jim Costa (Dem) 37.5%; the GOP’s Kevin Cookingham 38.5%. Rucker noted, “Costa is clearly in trouble with his own base; this is the first time he’s faced other Democrats for his 16th district seat. It’s also the only time he’s come in second in the primary.”

District 24: Salud Carbajal (Dem) 51.8%; Andy Caldwell (GOP) 44.5%. Rucker pointed out, “The last two elections, Democrat Salud Carbajal has easily won CA-24, defeating his opponent by over 17-points in 2018.”

District 25: This is ex-Congresswoman Democrat Katie Hill’s district; the Democrat, Christy Smith, won 30.25% while the two GOP candidates, Mike Garcia and Steve Knight, won 27.4% and 20.4% respectively. (55% of precincts reporting)

District 39: In a rematch of the 2018 election, GOP candidate Young Kim won 52.4% of the cote, incumbent Gil Cisneros won 42.6%

District 45: Democratic incumbent Katie Porter got 48.1% of the vote; GOP candidates got the rest, 51.9%

District 48: Rucker noted that the incumbent, Harley Rouda, got roughly 10% less than the GOP candidates’ total.

District 50: The Democratic candidate, Ammar Campa-Najjar, got 34.4%; the three GOP candidates totaled almost 60%."

No one has ever been held accountable. Nothing has ever been done.

“The chief, if not the sole, cause of the monstrous increase in cancer has been vaccination” – Dr. Robert Bell, fmr VP International Society for Cancer Research at the British Cancer Hospital

The public was kept in the dark for decades about tens of millions of polio vaccines laced with SV40, and its implications for the widespread epidemic of cancer.

The relevant facts were known by the scientific community back in 1960, but it wasn’t until lawsuits and investigative reports in the 1990s and a Congressional hearing in 2003 that the public was informed about the scale of the contamination and its possible link to many of the deadly forms of cancer spreading today. Yet little has been acknowledged in public discussion since that point.

In the aftermath of these admissions and inquiries, the CDC launched a fact sheet page on its website addressing the links between “Cancer, Simian Virus 40 (SV40), and Polio Vaccine” which noted the discovery of SV40, its presence in an estimated 10-30 million doses of polio vaccine and disputed scientific claims concerning its presence in cancer tumors and its possible role in causation.

Worse, scientists in the late 1990s revealed a secondary form of SV40 that was present in post-1963 versions of the polio vaccines — after the formulations with SV40 were replaced — which were not detectable in the testing methods used up until that point — meaning that the impact of this virus on the public could be even more widespread yet largely unknown.

Do they expect the public to forget?

Regardless, nothing has been done to hold any of the pharmaceutical giants responsible for this monstrosity liable for their actions, and the companies continue to produce vaccines administered to Americans every single day.

Whatever master agenda could be at work here, it is amazing that the American and global public continue to trust their bodies to the same science that ‘accidentally’ contaminated tens of millions of people vaccinated for polio with a monkey virus found time and again in cancerous tumors.

The presence of SV40 — which Merck vaccine scientist Maurice Hilleman joked in the video below caused tumors — has not officially been recognized by the government as having caused all these cancers (again, the CDC has continued to affirm ‘further research is needed’).

As this strain of monkey virus has consistently been found present in many types of cancerous cells in people all over the world at this point, the significance of such a correlation cannot be denied.

Why are the same industry and government players allowed to continue to play both God and doctor on your children? On your family, neighbors and fellow human beings? Why has no one been held accountable for these crimes of negligence, or worse?"

According to Business Insider he actually even compared the week to come to 9/11.

For us here in the United States this week could end up being the ‘hardest and saddest’ according to Adams. It seems experts have predicted what could be a surge in COVID-19 deaths and while only time will tell, the thought is not sitting well. Evidently, this outbreak has not yet hit its peak.

Adams told Fox News Sunday as follows on the topic:

“Well, it’s tragically fitting that we’re talking at the beginning of Holy Week because this is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly,”

“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized. It’s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.”

“And so, I want Americans to understand that, as hard as this week is going to be, there is a light at the end of the tunnel if everyone does their part for the next 30 days,”

From there Adams emphasizes the need for everyone who can to stay at home this week more than any other or so it seems, while a lot of people seem to be thinking this is being played up to get the public panicking, our panicked reactions are part of the problem. We all need to be staying at home and keeping our exposure to others at a minimum. This not just for ourselves but for others as well.

Business Insider wrote as follows on the topic:

The US has so far had the worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus worldwide with at least 312,249 confirmed cases and 8,503 deaths from COVID-19, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The death toll has already surpassed that of both the attack on Pearl Harbor during WWII and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.

He added: “I want [Americans] to understand that the public along with the state and federal government have the power to change the trajectory of this epidemic.”

When asked about the nine states that have yet to order residents to “stay at home,” Adams said he respected state leaders’ autonomy to make the best decision for their people, though he said he wished they would encourage citizens to follow the Trump administration’s “30 days to slow the spread” initiative.

Adams compared the varying policies nationwide state policies on cigarettes and opioids and said more people would die from smoking cigarettes than even in the most serious coronavirus projections.

“The coronavirus doesn’t recognize state’s rights,” Wallace responded. Adams then pointed toward New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s statements when the president said he was considering placing New York and neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut on an “enforceable quarantine.”

Cuomo had called Trump’s proposal “a declaration of war on states.”

There is no denying that the official numbers here in the US are rising and fast. If this week does prove to be as hard as Adams claims it will be, we should be keeping those working in the medical field in our thoughts now more than ever. Stay home and try to catch up on things you otherwise wouldn’t be able to. I know, not being able to get out and work is setting things back in huge ways but things will work out once all is said and done."

Inspector General Elizabeth Coleman needs to go to prison for not only failing to do her job, but for being complicit to the crimes of Wall Street scum who are stealing U.S. taxpayers blind. TRILLIONS!!! It's her job, but she shamefully attempts to weasel her way out of questions in Congressional hearings. She has betrayed her oath of office!!! Watch in the following video in which the respectable Congressman Alan Grayson rips her to pieces. She makes a total fool out of herself. Liars are easily exposed and Elizabeth A. Coleman is a filthy BIG LIAR!!! God will punish these massive criminals (Isaiah 13:11). Notice how her crooked lawyers are scrambling behind her and advising her what to say to lie...

This would be a laugh a minute, if it wasn't so serious. This woman has not got even the slightest clue, as to what is going on. This is early 2009, as of October 2009, the FED has committed to 23.7 trillion.

Hell will be hot!!! Romans 12:19 promises that God is going to recompense evil for evil in eternity. The wicked will be punished. They think that they're getting away with all these crimes, laughing at their elite parties and high-brow functions; but God is going to hold them accountable for even the words they speak (Matthew 12:36). Politico reports the cost of the bailouts is approaching twice the GDP of America. 23.7 trillion dollars is about 80,000.00 for every man, woman and child alive in this country today. 

 

 “If you spent a million dollars a day going back to the birth of Christ, that wouldn’t even come close to just one trillion dollars — $23.7 trillion is a staggering figure.” — Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California), the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee. 

 

 The total outstanding household debt in America is 13.7 trillion. What that means is the banker bailouts could have paid off ALL outstanding debt held by private citizens and then some. 

 

 Student loans? Home mortgages? Credit cards? Auto loans? All of it, paid in full.

Durán explained that a representative sample of the population in provinces and municipalities will be taken on Tuesday, May 12, to know in real time the progress of COVID-19 with tests known as TCR, which detect the new coronavirus before the disease manifests itself.

The case is to detect cases in apparently healthy people in regions that have not reported numerous infections with COVID-19 on the island and act accordingly, Durán said in his traditional press conference to offer a balance on the state of the pandemic in the island.

The tests will be carried out in remote parts of the island to detect if cases of COVID-19 have developed in those sites that have not been previously detected to carry out a major intervention, he said.

Massive studies will begin in Cuba to find cases of coronavirus and study the contacts that may have been made, in order to reduce the spread of the pandemic in the Caribbean country, he said.

Both pharyngeal examinations and rapid tests look for cases that are important in the transmission of the disease, the spread of which is three times faster than other known coronaviruses.

The great alarm that exists for this coronavirus is due to its contagion power, which is why it is necessary to maintain confinement and health measures, he considered.

On May 9, Cuba reported 12 new positive cases for COVID-19, along with three dead and 53 medical discharges, Dr. Francisco Durán reported at a press conference.

1,824 patients have been admitted to hospitals for clinical epidemiological surveillance, while 4,081 people are monitored at home from primary health care.

The doctor specified that 1,826 samples were studied on Saturday, and 13 samples were positive. The country accumulates a total of 67,335 samples made and 1,766 positive cases.

In fact, the name has only come-up again recently because of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) — filed by a firm called Action Institute on behalf of the media outlet The Daily Caller News Foundation.

For those still not familiar with the name, he’s the mysterious individual that former FBI Director James Comey used as a go-between in leaking out private memos detailing Comey’s interactions with the President.

After the President fired Comey on May 9th for mishandling a number of investigations, along with official misconduct and improper behavior befitting an FBI Director, Comey decided to take revenge against Trump and leaked those private memos claiming that the President instructed him to shut down the investigation against the President’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

However, Comey wanted to us a surrogate rather than directly leak the memos to the media, deciding on his good friend for over 30-years Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman, who willingly obliged.

Richman after receiving the memos from Comey leaked them to the New York Times, which in turn published them on May 16th raising questions about potential obstruction of justice by the President and setting off a call by Democrats for an investigation by a special counsel, the rest, as they say, is “history.”

That is until now, regarding why the FBI initially decided not to go after Professor Richman, though at the time to be a civilian leaking classified information to the media.

However there’s another hidden side to Professor Richman that the FBI was desperate to keep secret, nevertheless thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, The Daily Caller News Foundation along with Cause of Action Institute have just won a lawsuit against the FBI, informing the agency that they must comply and begin releasing records regarding a “special government employee” named Professor Daniel Richman, who has apparently been on the payroll along with his good friend Former FBI Director James Comey.

“The FBI has worked very hard to keep James Comey and Daniel Richman’s dealings free from public scrutiny,” said DCNF editor in chief Christopher Bedford. “Now, we might finally learn the truth about Comey’s ‘good friend’ Richman and just what Comey had him working on.”

Fox News revealed that Professor Richman had “special government employee” status with the Bureau, where he worked on special projects at Comey’s behest. However, those special projects were being stonewalled by the agency, thus the lawsuit.

The DCNF filed an FOIA request for “all records, documents, and communications about Daniel Richman, a special government employee hired by former FBI Director James Comey” shortly after the Fox report in April 2018.

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly rejected the FBI’s motion on Friday, setting the stage for them to begin providing documents within one month.

Judge Kollar-Kotelly ruled, “The court finds that the FBI has not shown exceptional circumstances or made sufficient progress in reducing its backlog to warrant an Open America stay.”

After the ruling one of the plaintiff’s weighted in stating, “This is a significant victory not just for The Daily Caller News Foundation, but for all members of the transparency community who want to hold the FBI accountable,” said Cause of Action’s Eric Bolinder. “The FBI picked the path of obstructing records transparency by misapplying the Open America standard. Thankfully, that now has to stop.”

Adding “This important precedent signals that the courts will not tolerate the federal government’s attempts to stall FOIA requests to circumvent transparency measures.”

No one knows yet for sure, how involved Richman was to the phony Russian Collusion hoax, if at all. However, within the next month or so that answer may finally be revealed, and another piece of the FBI puzzle will be complete."

Newman explains, “The time to prove this is finished. Everybody now knows this was a giant hoax. If this would have happened in any other country, imagine a coup against Angela Merkel where senior officials conspired to make up stuff and overthrow her government. Imagine this against Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron or the President of Mexico. In any one of those countries, all the coup plotters, all the traitors would have been rounded up, arrested and put on trial. Even the people realize this was a hoax, and not just a hoax because a hoax implies something funny or playful–this was a plot. This was a conspiracy to overthrow the democratically elected President of the United States and overthrow our constitutional system of government using criminal means to wage war on the United States. . . . There is nothing to discuss anymore. We know they did it. It’s time for them to be arrested and put on trial. I am very pleased that President Trump is using the word ‘treason.’ That’s the word that needs to be used, and the time to strike is now.”

Newman also says what happened in the failed coup to overthrow President Trump is much bigger than Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration. Newman contends, “This is much bigger, and the reality is the Deep State you are hearing talked about on the mainstream media and FOX News is about rogue bureaucrats. They are talking about FBI officials and officials at the intelligence agencies such as John Brennan and potentially even Obama and Hillary. The reality is the Deep State goes so much deeper than that. Behind the scenes, there is this vast network of secret organizations . . . where all the Deep Staters that we see interlock and meet up with Deep Staters that we don’t see. Probably the premier U.S. example of this is the Council on Foreign Relations. This is an international movement . . . and the goal has always been, as they admit themselves . . . the goal has always been to subvert U.S. sovereignty and merge us into a global regime that people call the New World Order.”

On the outrageous open borders and baby killing policies of the now far left Democrat party, Newman says, “The crazy is now coming out of the closet. That’s why they want the open borders. They know they have lost the American people. They are now coming out of the closet with this kookiness. They kill babies, they praise a communist cop killer. . . . We knew this was the Democrat party. We knew that the elites held these crazy views, but the public at large didn’t. Now, they are revealing their true colors. . . . Democrats have now become a threat to the survival of our republic as a free republic. They have become a threat to the survival of our Constitution and our liberties. . . . It’s win or lose right now. That is the situation they are in. If they don’t succeed this time around, I think they realize too many people are going to wake up, and they are going to be in major trouble. So, they are just going for it all the way right now–full stop. It really is a fight to the finish, and I think they are hoping with voter fraud, illegal immigration and brain washing of the kids, they can still pull this off. . . . The reality is people are waking up in huge numbers, and they can’t contain it anymore, even with censorship of the internet. . . . People are hungry for the truth, and people know they have been lied to.”

“With Egypt in revolt and the country’s future uncertain, concern is growing over whether a new government in the Arab world’s most militarily and industrially advanced country could accelerate an arms race in one of the world’s most volatile regions.

At the heart of the concern is intelligence indicating that Egypt has quietly carried out research and development on weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, biological and missile technology.

The research and development has continued virtually without pause over the past three decades, according to interviews with U.S. officials and a review of intelligence and other government documents by NBC News. Specifically, the intelligence indicates that Egypt has carried out experiments in plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment, helped jump-start Saddam Hussein’s missile and chemical weapons programs in Iraq, and worked with Kim il-Jung on North Korea’s missile program.

NTEB has been reporting to you since 2009 about how Barack Hussein Obama was the handpicked, George Soros created, New World Order globalist puppet to infiltrate and occupy the American government and do everything at his disposal to attempt to collapse our system from within. You can read our Obama archive of 1,300 plus articles by clicking here.

The”plan” was for Hillary Clinton to step into the Oval Office, with her victory bought and paid for by “unseen forces“, and she would continue Obama’s assault on our government and more importantly, shield from public view the facts exposing Obama for the usurper that he truly is. A Clinton victory would have for at least a generation let Obama get away scott-free. But the sovereign God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob had other plans, and another candidate in mind. Donald J. Trump. And that candidate, now our president, is exposing the whole thing. Obamagate is very real, and about blow sky-high.

Democrats plan to link Trump to the Russians is proving to be their own undoing

When Donald Trump won the presidency in the greatest upset in American history, the Democrats and all their associated minions immediately began a mad scramble to concoct a plan to prevent their evil deeds from coming to light. Their combined genius came up with the Russian Hacking Scandal, in which they hoped, President Trump would be either neutralized or impeached and thereby rendered moot. But, as the Bible points out in the verse at the top, they are starting to swing on the very gallows they created for President Trump.

Just when the Obama Shadow Government thought they had Trump painted into a corner, the president released a bombshell. He claimed that he was hacked and spied on at the authorization of then-president Barack Obama. His claim was met with the predictable and immediate refutation by the Fake News Media, but as they saying goes, not so fast. As the rocks began to be turned over, the slimy denizens beneath began to reveal that yes, orders were given to “hack Trump”, and that yes, then-president Obama was at the helm.

Obamagate will prove to be the greatest scandal in American history, eventually dwarfing previous ones like Watergate, the assassination of JFK by the CIA, and the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 by the New World Order.

And, in such beautiful irony, none of this may have come to light had the Democrats not tried to tie the Trump campaign to the bogus Russian Hacking Scandal.

Democrats and fake news media are terrified, and absolutely in panic mode. And they should be.

Obama meet Haman, Haman meet Obama. Get ready to go swinging…"

Dr. Anthony Mawson led a research team that investigated the relationship between vaccination exposures and acute or chronic illnesses in home-schooled children. The vaccinated children had a much higher rate of autism and ADHD, at a rate of 470% higher than those who received no shots. Vaccinated children were also more vulnerable to allergies and eczema. Unvaccinated children contract mild childhood diseases more frequently, but their vaccinated counterparts suffer pneumonia and ear infections more frequently. The finding that vaccination introduces a significant risk for autism is devastating to the vaccine industry and, therefore, will be vigorously attacked. –GEG

In a development that autism parents have long anticipated, the first-ever, peer-reviewed study comparing total health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated children was released on line yesterday. According to sources close to the project, the study had been reviewed and accepted by two different journals, both of which pulled back on their approval once the political implications of the findings became clear. That’s largely because, as parents have long expected, the rate of autism is significantly higher in the vaccinated group, a finding that could shake vaccine safety claims just as the first president who has ever stated a belief in a link between vaccines and autism has taken office.

Working in partnership with the National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI), Dr. Anthony Mawson led a research team that investigated the relationship between vaccination exposures and a range of over 40 acute and chronic illnesses in home schooled children, a population chosen for its high proportion of unvaccinated children. Surveying families in four states–Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oregon—the study (officially titled Vaccination and Health Outcomes: A Survey of 6- to 12-year-old Vaccinated and Unvaccinated Children based on Mothers’ Reports), reported a number of startling findings.

Vaccinated children were significantly more likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder: most notably, the risk of being affected by an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was 4.7 fold higher in vaccinated children; as well, ADHD risk was 4.7 fold higher and learning disability risk was 3.7 fold higher. Overall, the vaccinated children in the study were 3.7 times more likely to have been diagnosed with some kind of neurodevelopmental disorder.

Vaccinated children were also significantly more likely to be diagnosed with an immune-related disorder. The risk of allergic rhinitis (commonly known as hay fever) was over 30 times higher in vaccinated children, while the risk of other allergies was increased 3.9 fold and the eczema risk was increased 2.4 fold.

With respect to acute illness and infectious disease the outcomes were in some respects surprising. As might be expected, unvaccinated children were significantly (4-10 times) more likely to have come down with chicken pox, rubella or pertussis. Perhaps unexpectedly, the unvaccinated children were less likely to suffer from otitis media and pneumonia: vaccinated children had 3.8 times greater odds of a middle ear infection and 5.9 times greater odds of a bout with pneumonia.

The study was based on a survey with participants recruited in a process led by NHERI and coordinated through 84 state and local homeschool groups. The survey itself was, according to the authors, “nonbiased and neutrally worded.”

These findings in a study population of 666 children, 261 of whom (39%) were unvaccinated, are sure to stir controversy, in part because it is the first of its kind. The scientific literature on the long-term effects of the vaccination program is virtually silent. Most studies on the safety of vaccines only consider immediate or short-term effects. There was no obvious explanation for the differences in health outcomes observed between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups of children other than vaccination itself."

Several polls have already showed something similar, that most Americans don’t want Trump to be impeached. Though most Democrats do, especially far left democrats, moderates sit at only around 39% in favor of impeachment.

Interestingly the poll also found Trump had an approval rating of 40% but 59% did not want him impeached meaning that there are many people who do not approve of Trump but don’t think he should be impeached.

In another poll from Rasmussen we can see that 54% of voters think the media is just trying to stop Trump and they don’t trust the news they hear.

Which leads us to the big question. Outside of the people who don’t trust media, do people think Trump’s approval matters more than policy?

The question we need to ask is is Trump’s disapproval enough to stop his 2020 reelection or is the approval rating for Democrats worse? Will people be more likely to support an unpopular president if the Democratic parties policies are too far left?

1) 0.4% symptomatic CFR and 35% asymptomatic cases; 2) Based on 29% prevalence and 50,000 deaths; 3) The IFR is 0.50 excluding nursing homes.

These studies determine the actual prevalence of recent or current Covid-19 infections in a population or region. In most cases, they find that Covid-19 is much more widespread than previously assumed, with most people showing no or only mild symptoms.

Half of all deaths were below, half were above the median age.

Initial estimates based on Chinese data assumed a very high 20% hospitalization rate, which led to the strategy of ‘flattening the curve’ to avoid overburdening hospitals. However, population-based antibody studies (see above) have since shown that actual hospitalization rates are close to 1%, which is within the range of hospitalization rates for influenza (1 to 2%).

The US CDC found that Covid-19 hospitalization rates for people aged 65 and over are “within ranges of influenza hospitalization rates”, with rates slightly higher for people aged 18 to 64 and “much lower” (compared to influenza) for people under 18.

In local hotspots like New York City, the overall hospitalization rate based on antibody studies is about 2.5% (19.9% or 1.7 million people with antibodies and 43,000 hospitalizations by May 2).

The much lower than expected hospitalization rate may explain why most Covid-19 ‘field hospitals’ even in hard-hit countries like the US, the UK and China remained largely empty.

8) Percentage of Covid-19 deaths in care homes per country

In many countries, deaths in care homes account for 30 to 60% of all additional deaths. In Canadaand some US states, care homes account for up to 80% of all “Covid19-related” deaths.

You see as Bill Cooper said it before “there is some structure to their madness but really is not any structure for ours”. So they show us ‘things in plain sight’, but its not their fault if the people do not understand what is being shown to them.

When you look at the game theory of the last 30 years, US Presidents have been doing things that are illogically harmful toward the American populace, as well as toward the world.

The trillions of dollars lost in the Middle East and millions of casualties in Iraq alone, and what do we have to show for it? Those were open-ended wars that never concluded in decisive victory, by design.

The financial crisis in 2008, and millions of foreclosed on families—that was a consolidation wave for these ‘ruling’ families. Legalized theft.

If you have a lot of money—I mean, more than anyone—and if you really hate the United States, yet you’re old and weak and mostly wear black and mumble incoherent nonsense because you’re high on walnut sauce (adrenochrome) half the time, then you don’t take us on militarily.

You do it gradually, through proxies.

You find compromised sickos like Obama, or the Bushes, or the Clintons—plenty of sickos in this world without values, I’ve learned through covering the Pizzagate scandal—and once you have them properly compromised enough (Bill Clinton flew on the Pedo Express to Lolita Island a documented 26 times; a US President went to a pedophile blackmail island run by a billionaire associate of the Rothschilds, not once, but 26 times).

When you look back through the Boystown scandal, which was hastily covered up by the pre-Internet age media with the force of a military air campaign, it is clear that the Bushes and many of their business associates are simply sick, deranged people.

For people who literally invented many of our modern fiat currencies, as the Rothschilds did, spending a couple hundred million (at most) on propping up a Clinton or Bush or anybody else is not unreasonable—it is practical.

The close working relationship between Lynn Forester de Rothschild and the Clintons revealed by Hillary Clinton’s WikiLeaks is precisely what they didn’t want the world to see.

Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, of the United States, when she was carrying out personal favors for Lynn Forester de Rothschild’s family on the world stage. Fact.

Why stop there? Why not buy up the media that covers these politicians?

So they have. The Economist is literally published by Lynn Forester de Rothschild and the Rothschild family, and it’s a leading voice against Trump economic nationalism, and American prosperity in general, in favor of “globalist” values…."

Do you get a visceral reaction when jets spew their poison and ruin a beautiful blue sky day with their aerosols, nanoparticles and assorted toxic chemicals? 76-year-old actor and activist Chuck Norris agrees with you. Norris is using his celebrity and writing prowess to bring attention to these toxic geo-engineering programs. He recently penned an article in World News Daily entitled “Sky Criminals,” as reported by Inquisitor.com:

“[Norris] argued that people are not taking the issue seriously when there is evidence pointing to the government as having already used chemtrails.

“The chemtrails conspiracy theory claims that the U.S. government or other powerful people are using airplanes, helicopters, and other types of aircraft to control weather and people. In his article entitled Sky Criminals, Norris urged his readers to join him in asking more questions about ‘covert chemtrailing’ – which means that not only is the government practicing it, but also does it in secret.”

You can’t see the chemtrails if you’re constantly bowing down to your cellphone

When a populous has been trained to bow to the beast god of technology, they forget to look up. So, tell the uninformed to raise their heads and watch these jets spewing thick puffs of “exhaust” that do not dissipate like contrails, but spread out like tentacles, forming a haze that cuts down the sun’s rays. Norris writes about these artificial systems in his article from World Net Daily:

“Geoengineering is the artificial modification of Earth’s climate systems through two primary technologies: Solar Radiation Management, or SRM, and Carbon Dioxide Removal, or CDR.

“CDR technologies include ‘bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, direct air capture, ocean fertilization and enhanced weathering,’ according to Wikipedia. SRM technologies ‘seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce global warming. Proposed examples include the creation of stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Stratospheric sulfate aerosols create a global dimming effect [that] has made them a possible candidate for use in solar radiation management climate engineering projects to limit the effect and impact of climate change due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. Delivery of precursor sulfide gases such as sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide (h2S) or sulfur dioxide (So2) by artillery, aircraft and balloons has been proposed’

“Chemtrailing is the ‘public’s term for the classified [covert] and ongoing artificial modification of Earth’s climate systems using reflective nano-materials (aerosols) to reflect sunlight. The aerosols are dispersed via jet aircraft trails that expand into reflective artificial clouds.'”

Without photosynthesis, life on earth would cease to exist… Chemtrails have dimmed the earth by 31% since 1993

Chuck Norris’s article also mentions a 2003 NASA study that theorized delivery of vaccinations from the sky Word News Daily reports:

“The actual 2003 abstract from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a part of the U.S. federal government’s National Library of Medicine – a branch of the National Institutes of Health, reads:

“The feasibility of using aerosol vaccines to achieve mass and rapid immunization, especially in developing countries and disaster areas, is being assessed on the basis of current available information. The aerosol mode of vaccine introduction, which best follows the natural route of many infections, may first lead to development of immunity at the portal of entry, and may also induce a more generalized defense.”

Informed citizens know that carbon is essential to life and that the entire global warming/climate change excuse to control carbon is a ploy to control all life on earth. Other informed sources discuss chemtrials as a mechanism to drop nano bio applications for mind control. Whether barium, aluminum, sulfates, vaccines or bio apps, it’s time to look up and stop this evil destroying our skies and our food supply."

AT&T has called for an ""Internet Bill of Rights,"" arguing for a new, fairer standard to replace the Obama Administration's George Soros-backed ""net neutrality"" rules that the Federal Communications Commission voted in December to repeal.

Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&T is calling for an Internet Bill of Rights arguing “net neutrality” should also include all the giant Internet edge providers, including Google, Twitter, and Facebook.

These web giants, who apply content to the Internet and play a huge role in censoring the net, should also be included and not just limited to the Internet Service Providers (ISP) whose major function is to connect users to the Internet.

Infowars reports: Stephenson argued congressional action is needed to establish an Internet Bill of Rights that applies to all Internet companies and guarantees neutrality, transparency, openness, non-discrimination and privacy protection for all Internet users.

“Legislation would not only ensure consumer’s rights are protected but it would provide consistent rules of the road for all Internet companies across all websites, content, devices, and applications,” he said.

In a series of undercover videos, investigative reporter James O’Keefe and his Project Veritas organization have revealed the extent to which Twitter has used “net neutrality” rules to follow the lead of Google and Facebook in censoring out conservative and libertarian views.

On July 13, Infowars.com reported that the Soros-funded pro-censorship group had partnered with the salacious website PornHub to fight to keep in place the Obama administration “Net Neutrality” rules by organizing a “BOT” campaign to flood the FCC with “AstroTurf”-generated form letters by the hundreds of thousands with addresses from Russia, Germany, and France – all countries where the Internet is not regulated by the FCC.

As Infowars.com has repeatedly explained, “Net Neutrality” rules imposed fairness standards only on the ISPs like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon – the Internet switches through which users connect to the Internet – while not applying to Google, Facebook, and Twitter – the giant Internet content providers – who remained free under “Net Neutrality” rules to censor conservative and libertarian websites like Infowars.com.

QAnon champions the meme storm bolstering AT&T call for Internet Bill of Rights

In an Internet posting yesterday, on the “dark web” website 8chan, the secretive intelligence agent QAnon championed AT&T’s call for Congress to pass an Internet Bill of Rights.

This prompted QAnon’s thousands of anonymous followers, known as “Anons,” to call for a meme storm to support the new Internet standard AT&T has proposed to combat the rampant censorship of conservative and libertarian views openly practiced by the giant Internet edge providers, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

On Thursday, Jan. 25, QAnon posted a screen capture from Fox News’s Fox & Friends news segment that produced IP data to refute the #NeverTrump false argument that the #ReleaseTheMemo campaign to urge Congress to release the “Nunes Memo” prepared by the House Intelligence Committee was tied to “Russian Bots,” as argued by Democratic Rep.

Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, and by Sen. Diane Feinstein, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

In commenting on the Fox & Friends report, QAnon commented the following cryptic language:

Decoded, QAnon referenced the $2 billion dollar contract the NSA awarded to AT&T, a company QAnon has distinguished as a major Internet player that openly advocates policies that prevent the type of politically motivated censorship openly practiced by the giant Internet content providers like Google and Facebook.

Urging a “push” to get AT&T’s call for Congress to pass an Internet Bill of Rights, QAnon launched an Internet meme storm that Anons began producing on 8chan Thursday and Friday, preparing the memes for Internet launch over the weekend.

Look for the memes to start appearing on websites like Twitter under the following hashtag: #internetBillofRights."

Friday’s tally marks a significant decrease from the 351 deaths reported on Thursday, though that number included previously uncounted fatalities at care homes for the elderly.

France’s health ministry said in a statement that the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 infections fell again to 19,861 from 20,463 on Thursday, continuing an uninterrupted downward trend now in its fifth week.

The number of people in intensive care — a key measure of a health system’s ability to cope with the pandemic — also continued its downtrend, falling by 96 to 2,203, from more than 7,000 in early April at the height of the crisis.

Both figures are welcome news for the government, which has begun lifting lockdown measures this week in an effort to revive a flagging economy.

The government has warned it will consider locking down the country again if daily new infections rise above 3,000. On Friday, the number of infections increased by 563 to 141,919, up 0.4% and the ninth consecutive day that the case tally rose by about half a percentage point or less.



 President Trump said that he was mobilizing the military to inoculate most of the population against COVID-19 with a vaccination that has not even gone into production yet.

 In this fascinating and riveting episode Dark Journalist Daniel Liszt welcomes back Geoengineering Author Elana Freeland to preview her new research set for release in 2017 on the massive Multi Level Surveillance Project called 'The Space Fence.' 



 Early Development of SDI Technology

 The Space Fence was originally the brainchild of the Reagan era during the craze to build the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) a space based weapons defense program ostensibly designed to protect the US from incoming Russian nuclear missiles. It has been established that this early version of the Space Fence may have actually been created to keep an eye on unusual UFO developments in space. 



 HAARP Ionization of the Atmosphere & Nano Particles

 After abandoning SDI on paper, covert forces inside the National Security State continued to develop various uses for the space deployed technology. Realizing their new efforts of achieving a global domination through space surveillance on Earth could not be totally successful, they undertook to expand the ionization of the atmosphere which gives them the ability to implant tiny nano particles into the human body. These nano sensors can penetrate the blood brain barrier to activate wireless signals that can be remotely monitored and controlled. Human beings in effect would become walking cell towers that microwave signals could be beamed at and penetrated to automatically send back revealing data. 



 Planetary Lockdown

 The ultimate purpose behind this decades long project can not be fully known, but according to Elana's research we can deduce that its main goal is a Full Planetary Lockdown intended to centralize and control the full spectrum of activity on planet Earth, including human behavior, geopolitical events, weather conditions, earthquake activity and the creation of a manipulated reality within a gigantic artificial intelligence grid.

A new petition by LifeSiteNews already has almost 400,000 signatures from folks who are saying no to mandatory vaccination for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Within the first four days of the petition’s launch, more than 350,000 people signed it, followed by another 50,000 people over the past three days. And with your signature added to the petition, LifeSiteNews will easily exceed its next benchmark.

The petition states that while people of goodwill have varying opinions on the safety, efficacy, and religious implications of a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), everyone should be in agreement that forcing people to get jabbed is not okay.

“No government can force anyone who has reached legal adulthood to be vaccinated for the coronavirus,” the petition states. “Equally, no government can vaccinate minors for the coronavirus against the will of their parents or guardians.”

Over the next several weeks, LifeSiteNews is planning to deliver the petition to governments around the world, showing them that people everywhere are against coercive medicine that threatens punishment for no compliance.

“The enormous response to this petition shows that many people around the world absolutely will not accept a mandatory vaccine for the coronavirus,” says Gualberto Garcia Jones, the director of advocacy for LifeSiteNews.

The Trump plan to deliver a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine before the end of 2020 has shocked many who believed that the president was against vaccination. Consequently, there is concern about how this vaccine might be pushed on Americans, possibly without consent.

Because there remain many unknowns as to what the future holds, LifeSiteNews is urging its readers to share the story and petition on the Facebook page of the White House by posting it as a comment under a White House post. Natural News readers can do the same with this article.

Signing the petition, and getting other people to sign it, is important because the rush to develop and release a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is both disturbing and unethical, seeing as how it normally takes several years to develop, safety test, and release a new vaccine.

There is also talk of microchip implants that will go along with these vaccines, allowing the government to track and spy on Americans who receive it.

In California, Governor Gavin Newsom has promised that he will not open the state back up for business until there is a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine available, which some worry could imply that people will be forced to receive it. Billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates agrees that society should not reopen until there is a vaccine.

“We can now see more clearly that some of our politicians – people who are supposed to work for the public – are attempting to use this health crisis as an excuse to curtail our personal freedoms,” Jones adds, pointing to efforts that seek to make human guinea pigs out of American citizens.

“We cannot allow them to achieve that goal.”

Keep in mind that continued mutations of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) mean that any vaccine developed for it will be certifiably worthless, as well as dangerous. And it is simply not good policy to resort to compulsory medicine as the solution to this crisis, especially when there are already safe and natural alternatives.

The FBI broke into President Trump’s campaign, spied on him, then tried to cover it up.

Actually, Kevin, it’s worse than that. This overthrow attempt goes all the way back to our so-called “friends in the U.K.” who backed the would-be-juntas of the Senior Executive Services (Brennan, Clapper, Rice, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Comey, Wray, Haspel, Baker, Jarrett, Powers, Nuland, Yavonovitch, Kent, Lynch, Holder, Clinesmith, Taylor, Lerner, et al) who are supported by the fake media and fake intelligence agencies.

“In August, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the agency wouldn’t permit cancer warnings to be included on jugs of Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides, calling it a potentially false claim as the EPA has determined the chemical to be safe. That directive came after California unsuccessfully tried to require cancer warning labels for glyphosate, citing IARC’s classification of glyphosate as a probable carcinogen.

Bayer argued in its own recent Hardeman case filing that the EPA’s refusal to allow warnings should override the jury’s decision. The company argued it cannot be held liable by the jury for marketing a legal product with an EPA-approved label, which many scientists and regulators say isn’t carcinogenic.”

Historians Rip Into The New York Times After It Refuses To Address Requests For Corrections To The ‘1619 Project’"
630,True,"The article discusses allegations of misconduct and secrecy within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), suggesting a potential conspiracy.",True,The article mentions the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as the actor responsible for secretly removing classified documents.,True,The article discusses the actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in secretly removing classified documents and potentially violating the United States Constitution.,False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,True,The article connects events and allegations of misconduct to suggest a larger pattern of secrecy and potential wrongdoing within the CIA.,True,The article discusses the secretive actions of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in removing classified documents and potentially violating the United States Constitution.,"The Central Intelligence Agency secretly removed classified documents from a computer system used by Congress, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) said Tuesday morning, and may have violated the United States Constitution as a result.

Feinstein — the chair of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee — critiqued the CIA’s supposed conduct on the floor of the US Capitol Building early Tuesday in Washington, DC, and said that the agency’s alleged actions may have violated the constitutional principle of congressional oversight, as well as both the Fourth Amendment and a presidential executive order that prohibits the CIA from engaging in domestic search and surveillance.

The chairperson’s unexpected remarks early Tuesday came amid multiple requests for the Department of Justice to investigate allegations of misconduct between the chairperson’s panel and the secretive spy agency.

According to the Associated Press, Sen. Feinstein said the CIA improperly searched a stand-alone computer network at the agency’s Langley, Virginia headquarters that was put in place so that Intelligence Committee staffers could view sensitive documents.

As RT reported earlier, the CIA and Senate Intelligence Committee has been at odds in recent weeks after congressional staffers were accused of removing a draft document without authorization from the Northern Virginia facility while at work on an investigation pertaining to the agency’s use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques during the George W. Bush administration. The Senate committee finished their 6,300-page, $40 million study on the CIA’s torture program in late 2012, but the agency has yet to approve of a completed draft.

Previously, the CIA said someone affiliated with the Senate’s investigation took a document in violation of a user agreement between both parties. Members of Congress fired back, however, and accused the CIA of spying on Senate staffers in order to make such a determination.

On Tuesday, Sen. Feinstein threw her weight behind those allegations and said she had “grave concerns that the CIA’s search may well have violated the separation of powers principles embodied in the US Constitution.”

There is “no legitimate reason to allege to the Justice Department that Senate staff may have committed a crime,” Feinstein said, adding that she viewed the CIA’s request for an investigation as a “potential effort to intimidate this staff.”

“I am not taking it lightly,” Feinstein said. Following her remarks, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) told the Washington Post: “In 40 years here, it was one of the best speeches I’d ever heard and one of the most important.”

“There is no one who has more courage and conviction than Dianne Feinstein,” added Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nevada). John Brennan, the current director of the CIA, spoke of the scandal during a previously-scheduled discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations later Tuesday morning.

“[W]e are not in any way shape or form trying to thwart” the release of the torture report, Brennan said. With regards to allegations that the CIA “hacked” into the Senate-used computer, Brennan said: “Nothing can be further from the truth.”

“We wouldn’t do that,” Brennan said. “That’s just beyond the scope of reason.” Shortly after, White House press secretary Jay Carney said during a news briefing that Pres. Barack Obama “has great confidence in John Brennan and confidence in our intelligence community and in our professionals at the CIA.”"
631,True,The article suggests that America is becoming like Nazi Germany and that the Obama Administration is pushing for laws that would allow indefinite detention without trial. It also mentions powerful actors like Homeland Security and the Wall Street banking-mafia controlling Homeland Security.,True,"The article mentions actors like the Obama Administration, Homeland Security, House and Senate Armed Services Committee leaders, Democratic and Republican representatives, and the Wall Street banking-mafia.",True,"The article mentions actions like arresting and incarcerating individuals without trial, passing laws that authorize indefinite detention, protesting, being a political subversive, and abducting people labeled as enemies of the state.",True,"The article mentions threats like undermining constitutional rights, legalizing indefinite detention, and targeting anyone the globalists don't like.",True,"The article connects events and observations to suggest a pattern of America becoming like Nazi Germany, the Russian communist revolution under Stalin, and the gulag work camps.",True,"The article suggests that there is secrecy in the actions of the actors, such as the intentions of Homeland Security to mislead the public.","America increasingly is becoming like Nazi Germany during World War II. If the Obama Administration get their way, Homeland Security (terrorizing the homeland) will be able to arrest anyone they deem a terrorist, and incarcerate you indefinitely without right to an attorney or due process. The Bill of Rights won't protect you anymore. According to Patriot Act II, Americans can be charged with terrorism for even the slightest offences, like protesting in Speech Free Zones or being a political subversive. Incrementally, our goose is being cooked in America!

Out of 535 elected members of congress, only 40 object to this treasonous bill. The other 495 sorry, low-down, scum-sucking, slime-ball, members of congress ought to be fired. What a despicable group of traitors to the United States!

40 members of Congress have sent an urgent letter to House and Senate Armed Services Committee leaders protesting provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act that would legalize indefinite detention of American citizens without trial, as the revised version of the bill heads for a final vote on Thursday. “The Senate-passed version of the NDAA, S. 1867, contains Section 1031, which authorizes indefinite military detention of suspected terrorists without protecting U.S. citizens’ right to trial. We are deeply concerned that this provision could undermine the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth amendment rights of U.S. citizens who might be subjects of detention or prosecution by the military,” Opposition to the bill has been bipartisan. While the letter is signed mostly by Democratic members of Congress, Republican representatives like Justin Amash, Ron Paul, and Rand Paul have also been vocal in their opposition.

This is frighteningly reminiscent of the book Archipelago Gulag by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918-2008). That's exactly what was going on in the Russian communist revolution under Stalin between 1920-1950. People were being indefinitely detained, enslaved, sent into the gulags as work-prisoners for the almighty state. Millions of victims froze to death in Siberia working the coal mines and cutting down timber building Stalin's projects.

If an actor displayed anti-government sentiment in a play, he ended up in a gulag detention camp. Fathers would say goodbye to their wife and kids for a normal day at work (so they thought), never to return home again. People got into taxies and were never seen again.

Having been imprisoned for several years in a Russian gulag camp himself, Alexander Solzhenitsyn said oftentimes the very fear of being abducted and sent into the camps was worse than when it actually happened. Only 15% of the Russian population were sent into the gulag work camps, while the other 85% went about daily life as usual. While children played and people went about their business, the government abducted anyone whom they labeled as an enemy of the state. This is exactly what Homeland Security (a treasonous coup) is moving toward. This will happen in America, I assure you. It is starting already. This indefinite detention bill ought to frighten every American.

Political subversives were sent into the gulag work-camps. Authors who showed contempt for the revolution were deemed enemies of the state, sent into the work camps. This is what indefinite detention means my friend! Wake up! Women in the gulags were given privileges if they succumbed to the sexual advances of the prison officials. The horrors of the death-camp gulags greatly came to light when the Berlin Wall came down in 1987 (originally built in 1961) and historians rushed into East Germany to complete the historical records. The Russian government still refuses to acknowledge the atrocities of the death-camps, typical of Communist regimes.

If you haven't figured it out yet, this law is going to target anyone and everyone whom the globalists don't like. Homeland Security is an insidious (working or spreading in a hidden and usually injurious way) group, controlled by the Wall Street banking-mafia and the Military Industrial Complex. These traitors are the villainy of mankind, hardcore servants of Satan.

Woe unto all the woefully ignorant Americans who sit and listen to the paid liars and deceivers in the mainstream newsmedia. Most of what people are being fed by the evil newsmedia is distorted lies, controlled opposition and deception. Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly are traitors to America, enemies of Jesus Christ and no friend to the American people. Rotten television programming, such as THE VIEW is evil to the core, intended to promote the homosexual agenda and the agendas of the globalists who keep them rich.

The Bible foretold in 2nd Thessalonians 2:9 that Satan would deceive men with lying wonders. Everything that the Bible teaches us about Satan (our enemy) tells us that the Devil is a deceiver, liar, murderer and thief. Those who follow Satan are those who pull on the same rope as the Devil. Anyone who promotes abortion rights, homosexual rights and feminist rights is of the Devil.

And may I say, any politician who supports anti-American agendas after taking a sworn oath of office to defend and uphold American sovereignty is a liar, thief and scoundrel. President Barack Obama (which is not even his real name) broke nearly every campaign promise that he made to the American people to get elected. Mr. Obama is a cruel hoax! Most of our leaders are dirty, rotten lying criminals. And saddest of all are the spiritually sick, arrogant, self-styled, apostate and wicked pastors of churches who support such criminals, hiding behind a convenient perverted interpretation of Romans 13. God help us!!!"

A new report by Swedish national broadcaster (SVT) found there was no evidence of Russian bots posting upwards of 2,000 anti-5G posts in total, but rather a granny in Sweden running a grassroots social media group, who was opposed to cellular network radiation.

The posts began in December 2019, when Ygeman pointed out to the Swedish press that thousands of negative 5G comments were showing up on his Facebook account. He immediately blamed “Russian trolls,” and the mainstream media took his word as face value, reported RT News.



 A comedian makes more sense that a #DeepState bureaucrat. George Carlin vs Fauci — Carlin predicted the black comedy we’re experiencing now as we trade our liberty for the promise of safety

Dagens Nyheter, a leading newspaper in Sweden, ran a headline that was titled “Ygeman target for Russian net attack” with no credible evidence that Russia launched a troll attack on him. Earlier this year, Russian Embassy rejected his claims:

As it turns out, SVT traced the posts back to a local grassroots group called “WiFi Radiation Health Risks Stop 5G,” which is led by Katarina Hollbrink, 64, who describes herself as a granny that is against 5G and lives in Södermalm, Stockholm. The Swedish paper quoted Hollbrink, who said it’s kind of “ridiculous” for the government to accuse “ordinary Swedish citizens of being Russian trolls.”

The Russian Foreign Ministry’s Facebook page posted a meme on Sunday that poked fun at Ygeman’s outlandish comments from late last year, blaming a “Russian troll attack,” while, “in fact, carried out by a domestic tinfoil-hat group,” the post read.

The controversy comes as Sweden is introducing 5G telecoms networks across the country, allowing citizens and businesses to experience lighting fast upload and download speeds that are far superior to existing 4G technology. Sweden didn’t exclude Chinese tech giant Huawei from building out its 5G network, unlike many other Western nations.

Well, step aside all you doubters and listen up carefully to what took place in the halls of Congress on May 14, 2014 regarding the weather modification system known as HAARP.

In the YouTube below Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) asks some pointed questions about HAARP. However, readers may not be surprised at the answers, but the mainstream media ought to be wiping oodles of egg yolk from its collective face.

Furthermore, the U.S. Air Force intends to dismantle the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) in Gakona, Alaska, by or during the summer of 2014!

Built at a cost of more than $290 million, the site has 180 antennas on 30 acres that are used to direct energy into the ionosphere, which is 55 miles to 370 miles above the Earth, and monitor changes in the flow of charged particles. Stevens was the godfather of HAARP, which he helped start two decades ago with annual earmarks slipped into the defense budget.

It seems that no research facility can be found to take over the HAARP Alaska facility. Could that be an indication that the weather modification system is regarded unfavorably? I find that as a possibility and extremely interesting, especially in view of all the technology that was invested and built into it. If no one wants to continue operating HAARP, will the State of Alaska be interested in it for education research purposes? But then, maybe HAARP-at-sea-ships, i.e., the Tesla Weapon Platform SBX-1, probably will be the most effective ‘on-site’ HAARP facility rather than one remotely stationary on land.

However, there are numerous HAARP facilities in other countries around the globe that the Tesla Weapon Platform SBX-1 possibly could interact with. But then, we have to wonder what Assistant Secretary Walker was referring to when he stated that they got out of HAARP Alaska what they wanted and were moving on…moving on to what? 



May 2nd, 2014, I published “What’s With the Weather and Chemtrails?” Readers may want to review in light of the latest “bombshell” acknowledgement by Walker at a Congressional hearing. 



Conspiracy theories and theorists truly have been vindicated about HAARP. 



Knowing the dogged research we, who are proclaimed ‘tin hat theorists’, perform and circulate, this writer feels extremely confident that other information regarded as ‘conspiracy theories’ about vaccines and other ‘sacred cow’ secrets also will be vindicated at some forthcoming date—just when, who knows—since it all depends upon who has the integrity to stand up and tell the facts of what’s been going on that the U.S. media, press, TV, and controllers won’t permit be made public until it’s too late to get objection going to stop the destruction of the planet and humankind."

My Startling Dream After Hearing Trump's Announcement About the US Embassy Move in Jerusalem

This post relates to my previous free article on Trump's December 7th, 2017 announcement recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to begin the four year process of moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

The first dream in this post came the night after I heard that news and immediately began work on that article. The reception of the dream in the midst of writing the article over two days was a clear confirmation to me from God of what I had concluded and begun writing. Namely, that the embassy move to Jerusalem is (finally) a real step towards the Isaiah 17/Psalm 83 war, and that the embassy move will provide something I had overlooked up to that point: extra provocation the Arabs need to overcome normal complacency about acting on their hatred for Israel in the most grave and costly way: a fourth confederate Arab attack on Israel in modern times.

Read the dreams for yourself and decide if they confirm for you as well that my conclusions above are inspired.

Mannarino contends, “I absolutely think that’s going to happen. Before they allow this mechanism that they have propped up with these distortions that are so extreme, to correct to fair market value, they are going to throw everything at it to keep it going. Again, the alternative is too horrible to contemplate—too horrible to contemplate. The world will become Baltimore when the debt bubble bursts. Every street in every nation around the world is going to become Baltimore as people realize they cannot acquire basic assets. Everyone is struggling for these resources. This is really what it’s all about. They understand this. The world central banks are not stupid. This goes back to why the police are militarized in every state in the union. We are one nation under surveillance. They have understood where this was going for many, many years.”

Mannarino goes on to say, “The mechanism that is in place right now is boosting up the stock market at the expense of everyone else in regard to the gap between the haves and the have-nots. We are clearly moving back to a two-tier society. When this is over, the middle class will not exist–period.”

In terms of the so-called recovery, Mannarino says, “We are going nowhere. We got consumer spending falling off a cliff despite the promise we heard from the mainstream that people were going to be saving cash at the pumps and we were going to be spending it on other things. . . . We got manufacturing falling off a cliff. Exports are falling off a cliff. We’re in decline. There is no doubt about it, and they bare blaming the weather and everything they can think of to try to get people to believe this is a good economy. This is the new norm, and I don’t see how people can believe the nonsense anymore. This is it. The new norm is what we have now. . . . This is a set up for a massive downside move with asset prices.”

On the latest Fed meeting about raising interest rates, Mannarino says, “They took away any reference to any calendar date. We have heard it’s going to be in June, then it’s going to be in September. Now, it’s all “data dependent,” and every media is considered “live,” whatever that means. In the grand scheme of things, they keep moving goal posts.”

On the rising U.S. dollar, Mannarino predicts, “I believe we just hit a top in the U.S. dollar. We are starting to see the dollar pull back, and we are starting to see commodities go up. . . . The dollar has to correct here. It went up on speculation of a rate increase, and it will go down because there will be no rate increase.”

On gold, Mannarino contends, “I believe that we are at a natural bottom now because of the actions of the dollar. The Federal Reserve is not going to raise rates anytime soon, and the dollar will correct and we’ve seen this. I am not saying the dollar is going down in a linear fashion. I am not saying gold and silver are going to go up in a linear fashion. I do think we have tipped over, and we could be at the cusp of a major bull run with the precious metals. . . . By holding a hard asset . . . you are betting against that debt. That is the short end of the trade, and that is probably the best trade in the history of the world.”

When non-persistent spraying is in progress, you can often see a white sheen covering the sky. It's as if a white nylon stocking is stretched across the entire sky. This sheen is not like the all-encompassing haze that covers the sky when persistent chemtrails spread out and join. This is a very smooth, evenly-distributed metallic layer that makes parts of the sky so bright that you cannot look at it. This sheen is most blatantly visible when looking at the area around the sky near the sun. You will see that it is difficult to see where the sky meets the sun because of the intensity of the white sheen. This blending of the sun with the surrounding sky is something I've never witnessed before chemtrails appeared. This phenomenon is likely caused by fine particulates that are spread out across the sky very evenly at a high altitude. I would guess that this is accomplished through frequent, non-persistent spraying at high altitudes. I have witnessed this sheen after seeing numerous, high-altitude, non-persistent chemtrails being sprayed. At sunset, this layer manifests itself in a unique way. When the sun is low enough to turn red, you can see a faint pink hue to the sky that extends far above the horizon, much farther than you would normally see pink coloring. It's common for me to see this pink extending 50° up from the horizon long after the sun has fallen behind the trees. Again, this is something I've never witnessed before the appearance of chemtrails."

A total of 4,215,514 people around the world have been infected by the coronavirus (COVID-19), according to data from Johns Hopkins University on Wednesday.

Even as the pandemic continues to rage, many parts of the world are starting to loosen restrictions. But many countries in Asia – in particular, those hailed for their early response – are battling the pandemic again, as new clusters emerge.

Health officials in Singapore reported 884 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, bringing the country’s total caseload to 24,671, with 21 deaths. The island nation, once praised for its initial handling of the coronavirus, now has the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia, followed by Indonesia and the Philippines with 14,749 and 11,350 cases, respectively.

Kenneth Mak, the director of medical services for Singapore’s Ministry of Health, said that the government will boost testing capacity fivefold, from 8,000 to as many as 40,000 tests a day later this year.

Authorities in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic began, said that it will test all 11 million residents after new cases were confirmed this week. The new cluster of cases was linked to a man who first became ill in March and contracted the disease again last month.

However, local reports revealed that the outbreak is more severe than how it is portrayed in state media. In addition, the Epoch Times published an account of how authorities detained a woman who demanded justice for her daughter who died of COVID-19.

“I won’t stop. I will continue my protest until I get justice for my daughter,” Yang Min, the protester, told the Epoch Times.

New cluster in South Korea linked to nightclub

In Seoul, officials are scrambling to contain the capital city’s biggest coronavirus clusters. Using mobile phone data, credit card statements and closed-circuit TV footage, health authorities have identified around 100 new cases of coronavirus after an infected man visited bars and clubs in Itaewon, a known nightlife district.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified over 10,000 people in the area at the time of the incident and have tested over 7,000 people, including family members and co-workers of clubgoers. Currently, the agency is still tracing over 1,900 people who have yet to be identified.

The states of Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro will start requiring its residents to wear masks in public places and on public transportation following a steep increase in coronavirus-related deaths. Sao Paolo has also extended its stay-at-home measures to the end of the month. (Related: SECOND WAVE of coronavirus infections about to hit Germany as country relaxes lockdowns and social distancing regulations.)

The move, however, has put the states in the crosshairs of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the severity of the coronavirus and has pushed for the country to reopen – despite having over 178,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the highest in South America. Public health experts have also noted that the coronavirus crisis is getting worse in the country. In the past two days, over 1,200 people have died, while many hospitals in the country are reaching capacity.

Infectious disease experts in the country are also pushing to extend restrictions, saying that the outbreak still hasn’t slowed.

“We’re in a state of calamity, the worst since World War II, and some people minimize it, saying it’s just an annoyance,” said Carlos Fortaleza, an epidemiologist at Sao Paolo State University.

The mainstream media is actively trying to bury the findings of a new study that sheds a not-so-positive light on influenza vaccines. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Vaccine, the shocking paper reveals that pregnant women who receive seasonal flu shots year after year are more than four times more likely to have spontaneous miscarriages compared to women who don’t get jabbed.

Funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this groundbreaking research rejects the official government narrative that all vaccines are completely safe and effective, which is probably why some of the gatekeepers of “science” are already starting to question its implications. Vaccine‘s editor-in-chief, Dr. Gregory Poland, for instance, recently stated contradictorily that while the paper raises important questions about vaccine safety that shouldn’t be ignored, he also doesn’t believe that flu shots are in any way responsible for causing miscarriages.

“Not at all,” Dr. Poland emphatically stated when asked whether or not flu shots are risky business for pregnant women.

How Dr. Poland can make such a claim when the study was conducted using rigorous scientific methods that many consider to be the “gold standard” is a bit disingenuous, especially when considering the fact that if the opposite had been discovered – that pregnant women can get flu shot after flu shot with no risk of complications – such findings would have been immediately declared by every major health agency and news station to be gospel truth.

GLYPHOSATE testing is now being applied to all Health Ranger Store branded products. Our in-house lab uses LC-MS-MS (triple quad mass spec). See the full lab science tour video and announcement here. Shop for ultra-clean, lab-tested superfoods, personal care products and more at the Health Ranger Store, the world's most trusted source for clean foods and lab-verified nutritional solutions.

Further, it was two CDC researchers, not “anti-vaxxers,” who noticed what ABC News described as “a big difference” between women who had miscarried within 28 days of getting a flu shot, as well as who had received a flu shot the year prior. Among such woman, 17 of the 485 evaluated had miscarriages compared to only four of 485 women from an unvaccinated comparison group.

The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota reported on these findings as suggesting “a strong association between receiving repeated doses of the seasonal influenza vaccine and miscarriage.” That pretty much speaks for itself, wouldn’t you say?

Flu shots cause spontaneous abortions, the remains of which are used to manufacture other vaccines

Besides the inherent risk of spontaneous abortion that comes with pregnant women getting flu shots, according to this latest research, there’s also the use of aborted human fetal tissue in many vaccines that suggests the vaccine industry is really just an extension of Planned Parenthood and other key players in the abortion industry.

Consider a research article that was published by Jessica Farnsworth back in May 2011 that looked at the link between aborted human babies and vaccine production. As it turns out, the vaccine industry technically relies on the abortion industry to develop new vaccines, so it’s hardly surprising that these same vaccines seem to cause abortions as well.

“Cell strains from fetal organs can multiply many times and provide a cell source for many decades, serving as an ideal culture medium due to their longevity,” Farnsworth reported. “One aborted baby can be the source of a cell strain with a potential yield of about 20 million metric tons of cells, which can be stored frozen for many years. The availability of aborted babies also presents an economic advantage over animal sources of cell cultures such as monkey, chicken, duck, dog, or rabbit, since animals must be housed, fed, maintained, and bred.”

So there you have it: The disgusting truth that the abortion business is key to vaccine production, which in turn results in more abortions. It’s a constant cycle of death being propagated against the American people in the name of “public health,” but thankfully the truth is spreading."

He said there was ""no way"" the tenfold leap in autistic children could be the result of better recognition and definitional changes, as claimed by health authorities. ""It is highly likely that at least part of this increase is a vaccine related problem."" he said. ""But whatever it is, why isn't the Government taking this massive public health problem more seriously?""

 He said he had decided to speak out because of his deep concern at the lack of treatment for autistic children with bowel disease, as revealed in The Mail on Sunday two weeks ago. He called the sudden termination of legal aid to parents of allegedly vaccine-damaged children in late 2003 ""a monstrous injustice"". After agreeing to be a witness for the parents, he received thousands of documents relating to the case. ""Now, it seems, unless the parents force the Government to restore legal aid, much of this revealing evidence may never come out,"" he said.

To be effective, the commercial interests use persons whom the public trusts. These spokespersons then promote the activity. They lie about its risks. They portray an activity that is less than safe as not only safe but also desirable. In the place of proof of safety, these propagandists invariably tout the ""lack of evidence of harm"". In addition, the promoters of an unsafe activity do all they can to bury studies that question the activitys safety under an avalanche of ""recognized"" studies that are peddled as showing ""no evidence of harm"". Those who benefit from the commercial activity also do all they can to discredit those persons who dare to publish studies that question the safety of the activity.

Wittkowski and remove his video.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article presents Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski's alternative approach to dealing with the pandemic.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"In its fight to stamp out “misinformation” about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), Google-owned YouTube has silenced a prominent epidemiologist whose opinions and ideas about the pandemic contradict certain facets of the official narrative.

Dr. Knut M. Wittkowski, the former head of biostatistics, epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller University, was featured in a video about the virus that was recently posted to YouTube before being quickly removed from YouTube for violating the tech giant’s “community standards.”

The 65-year-old expert in viruses is a vocal critic of so-called “social distancing” and other government-imposed measures that supposedly aim to fight the pandemic. He has repeatedly warned that such measures are not helping but rather prolonging the crisis – and for this he is no longer welcome on YouTube.

About the time that a video of Dr. Wittkowski explaining all of this reached about 1.3 million views, YouTube pulled it down and banned it, just like it has done to many other videos and channels over the years.

In Dr. Wittkowski’s view – and keep in mind that the guy holds two doctorates, one in computer science and the other in medical biometry – the best response to the Wuhan coronavirus is to basically let it do its thing. Most people will not even develop symptoms, and thus will never even know they have it. The small percentage of people who do get sick will also largely recover, while those with the highest risk can simply stay at home until the worst of it has ended, if they so choose.

“With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd immunity,” he stated in the now-deleted video. “About 80 percent of the people need to have had contact with the virus, and the majority of them won’t even have recognized that they were infected.”

You will not encounter this type of censorship at Brighteon.com, by the way, which is hosting the Plandemic film that has also been deleted and banned by YouTube.

As usual, YouTube provided no explanation as to why Dr. Wittkowski’s video was removed

In speaking to the New York Post about his video’s removal, Dr. Wittkowski was perplexed, to say the least. He said that all he did was share with viewers his understanding as to how viruses work while presenting an alternative approach to dealing with this current pandemic, which apparently is not allowed.

“I was just explaining what we had,” he stated. “They don’t tell you why. They just say it violates our community standards. There’s no explanation for what those standards are or what standards it violated.”

Another possible reason that Dr. Wittkowski got the axe from YouTube is because he has likened the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to a “bad flu,” an opinion that YouTube and other tech giants have stated in the past “is problematic.” Everyone is apparently expected to believe that this crisis is the worst thing to strike the world since the Holocaust, and all must respond with cowering trepidation to the government’s demands.

“Anything that goes against [World Health Organization] recommendations would be a violation of our policy and so removal is another really important part of our policy,” admitted YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki during a recent interview with CNN.

While Dr. Wittkowski’s viewpoints may not be in the majority, they do align with what has been implemented in Sweden, where “social distancing” and societal shutdowns were never implemented.

Facebook is also going after people and groups that it deems as spreading “dangerous” information. The company has reportedly been working with state governments in California, Nebraska and New Jersey to remove event pages for anti-lockdown gatherings.

This evening at 11 PM eastern time, a massive LO pressure system is going to organize over the North and South Dakota border, producing near blizzard conditions, massive snow, and followed by a drop slot of no moisture and NO Canadian cold winds from the northwest as is normal in weather there blowing for several days after a front.

Traditionally normal weather on the American Great Plains involved two systems. The Oregon LO pressures would slam into the American Rockies, reorganize, and produce dry weather fronts with mild weather.

The California LO pressures would slam into the Sierra Nevadas and Rockies dropping most of their moisture and power, and then reform in Colorado to produce the infamous Trinidad Lo Pressures which would bring Cyclones and Blizzards across the American mid section.

In addition to this, Clippers, which are Arctic Lo Pressure ridges in the winter and early autumn would bring chilling winds of 50 mph and above, but little moisture.

That is normal weather patterns, but now in HAARP, the Northern Great Plains are experiencing massive LO pressure systems forming when they absolutely can not form.

First one needs a Lo Pressure energy ridge to for a storm system. There is none.

Second, weather is generated by uneven heating and cooling. That is why Trinidad Colorado produces those systems as it involves dry air over the plains, warm Texas air and cold North Plains air.

Third, none of that is available now as the heat is in Texas, and the entire Plains is cold air due to HAARP trying to keep early drought from taking place in America by keeping it all in the freeze box.

As another exclusive here, the Obama regime has really f*cked this up in the delay of spring using HAARP as spring wheat for your Mark Levin bread must be sown this week on the high plains and into next week into North Dakota. It is buried under these HAARP storms and every week it delays, means lower production per acre.

 Mark Levin will probably blame it on corn planting again as his oil tycoons write his talking ponits hating bio fuel production.

So a climatic impossibility is taking place in America, a super LO is forming tonight, and it will dump huge amounts on Grand Forks into the buried Duluth Minnesota area. None of this should be possible, and yet it is taking place due to HAARP.

 There have been a few other storms such as this, this season which leads one to conclude that HAARP is learning to “spin the atmosphere” and load it up with these freeze dried snows, which are absolutely worthless as they evaporate when melting and there is absolutely no moisture in this odd fuzz fiber snow that leaves CHERRY CLOTH in the underlayers named snow mold.

Amazing in this that the Great American Desert is known by that name as their are no oceans with moisture to produce rain or snow. Yet in Obama super snows flooding the American interior out and these HAARP storms, one finds “moisture” being spiked like an ocean wash basin being dumped into the upper atmosphere to produce these cyclones on land now.

HAARP is learning to push moisture into areas which none could possibly be generated. The only natural means for anything such as this were hurricanes slamming in from the Gulf of Mexico or Pacific hurricanes hitting Mexico and reorganizing to pull moisture from the Gulf to the interior……..and yet now there is by HAARP a moisture dump rolling in from the upper atmosphere, and in the heating of the upper levels, this LO Pressure is being created in the desert which is winter cold and covered with the last blast of HAARP winter that you probably missed it, but places like Sioux Falls South Dakota were destroyed by an ice storm and places like Duluth were buried under this HAARP storm.

 Interesting in the reports though there was not any BROWN SNOW in this as this blog reported in the yellow snow evidence posted here. The current snow is blue and white again with no Peking toxic pollution.

Yes you can call this Lame Cherry matter anti matter exclusives again as they are, and are according to meteorologists going to produce an event this evening which can not be, and yet it is due to HAARP.

Why is only this blog posting about Peking toxic storms dumping poisons on America? Odd is it not that none of the environmentalists have uttered a George Soros or Birther Obama word about it.

 Why the cover up or was it only to destroy America that “acid rain” mattered in that farce, and when it is Peking poison dumping millions of tons of pollution on America that it a form of warfare by the global feudal Marxist state which must not be made known to alert the public.

There is a real danger now in this as wheat planting will not take place for at least one week in the Great Plains. This is deliberate now by HAARP. That will mean a 20% reduction in wheat crop production this season.

Only this blog told you last year already that something odd was taking place in Soros, Archers Daniel and Cargill were hording wheat and making huge shipments on Buffett BNSF trains……that grain never left America and these conglomerates have been hording all grains and not selling them, for reason.

HAARP is delaying another Obama drought. It now is reducing wheat crop planting and that is a huge problem in food prices and feeding people. This is all engineered, and by evidence HAARP is learning to roll the atmosphere to create cyclones where they can not appear."

Pope Francis vs. Donald J. Trump is actually The False Prophet (Revelation 19-20) versus 666 The AntiChrist (Revelation 13)

PEACE PORTAL ARCH, WA – Jorge Bergoglio as Pope Francis with a hermeneutic consciousness as “The False Prophet”, as defined in Revelation chapter 19, first reached out to expose Donald John Trump (whose gematria is 666) as the AntiChrist of Chapter 13 of Revelation on February 16, 2016, saying “Donald Trump is not Christian” for building walls and not bridges between people.

Chapter 19, verses 19-20 of Revelation state, referring to Pope Frances,“19. Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army. 20 But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.”

Chapter 13, verses 11-18 of Revelation state, referring to Donald J. Trump, “The Beast out of the Earth

 11 Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.

 12 It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.

 13 And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people.

 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.

 15 The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.

 16 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,

 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.

 18 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.

On February 18, 2016, Donald J. Trump, most probably with the covert consciousness of 666 the AntiChrist, responded to Pope Francis public rebuke from the U.S. Presidential campaign, where he was a candidate for U.S. President. Trump stated, “If the day that the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, the Pope would only wish that wish and pray that Donald Trump is U.S. President.”

This conscious battle between two archetypal, prophecized world leaders is not acknowledged more publicly in open civil discourse and reported more widely in public media because of a powerful clandestine international network dedicated to hide this reality in plain sight.

 Is Donald J. Trump the Beast of Revelation? Why does the number 666 keep turning up ― over & over again ― where Trump & his family are concerned, as documented extensively in this thread?

And I’ve been a practicing Catholic my whole life,” said Vice President Joe Biden in 2012. “I accept my church’s position on abortion as … doctrine. Life begins at conception. … I just refuse to impose that on others.”

For four decades, Biden backed the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of the tax dollars of Joe’s fellow Catholics to pay for what they view as the killing of the innocent unborn.

Last week, Joe flipped. He now backs the repeal of the Hyde Amendment.

Ilyse Hogue of NARAL Pro-Choice America welcomed home the prodigal son: “We’re pleased that Joe Biden has joined the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in coalescing around the Party’s core values — support for abortion rights.”

But when did the right to an abortion — a crime in many states before 1973 — become a “core value” of the Democratic Party?

And what are these “values” of which politicians incessantly talk?

Are they immutable? Or do they change with the changing times?

Last month, Disney CEO Bob Iger said his company may cease filming in Georgia if its new anti-abortion law takes effect: “If (the bill) becomes law, I don’t see how it’s practical for us to continue to shoot there.”

The Georgia law outlaws almost all abortions, once a heartbeat is detected, some six to eight weeks into pregnancy. It reflects the Christian conservative values of millions of Georgians.

To Iger and Hollywood, however, Georgia’s law radically restricts the “reproductive rights” of women, and is a moral outrage.

What we have here is a clash of values.

What one side believes is preserving the God-given right to life for the unborn, the other regards as an assault on the rights of women.

The clash raises questions that go beyond our culture war to what America should stand for in the world.

“American interests and American values are inseparable,” Pete Buttigieg told Rachel Maddow. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Claremont Institute: “We have had too little courage to confront regimes squarely opposed to our interests and our values.”

Are Pompeo and Mayor Pete talking about the same values?

The mayor is proudly gay and in a same-sex marriage. Yet the right to same-sex marriage did not even exist in this country until the Supreme Court discovered it a few years ago.

In a 2011 speech to the U.N., Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, “Gay rights are human rights,” and she approved of U.S. embassies flying the rainbow flag during Pride Month.

This year, Mike Pompeo told the U.S. embassy in Brazil not to fly the rainbow flag. He explained his concept of his moral duty to the Christian Broadcasting Network, “The task I have is informed by my understanding of my faith, my belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior.”

The Christian values Pompeo espouses on abortion and gay rights are in conflict with what progressives now call human rights.

And the world mirrors the American divide.

There are gay pride parades in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, but none in Riyadh and Mecca. In Brunei, homosexuality can get you killed.

To many Americans, diversity — racial, ethnic, cultural, religious — is our greatest strength.

Yet Poland and Hungary are proudly ethnonationalist. South Korea and Japan fiercely resist the racial and ethnic diversity immigration would bring. Catalans and Scots in this century, like Quebecois in the last, seek to secede from nations to which they have belonged for centuries.

Are ethnonationalist nations less righteous than diverse nations likes ours? And if diversity is an American value, is it really a universal value?

Consider the treasured rights of our First Amendment — freedom of speech, religion and the press.

Saudi Arabia does not permit Christian preachers. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, converts to Christianity face savage reprisals. In Buddhist Myanmar, Muslims are ethnically cleansed.

These nations reject an equality of all faiths, believing instead in the primacy of their own majority faith. They reject our wall of separation between religion and state. Our values and their values conflict.

What makes ours right and theirs wrong? Why should our views and values prevail in what are, after all, their countries?

Under our Constitution, many practices are protected — abortion, blasphemy, pornography, flag-burning, trashing religious beliefs — that other nations regard as symptoms of a disintegrating society.

When Hillary Clinton said half of all Trump supporters could be put into a “basket of deplorables” for being “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic,” she was conceding that many Trump’s supporters detest many progressive values.

True, but in the era of Trump, why should her liberal values be the values America champions abroad?

With secularism’s triumph, we Americans have no common religion, no common faith, no common font of moral truth. We disagree on what is right and wrong, moral and immoral.

Without an agreed-upon higher authority, values become matters of opinion. And ours are in conflict and irreconcilable.

Understood. But how, then, do we remain one nation and one people?"
649,True,"The article discusses the idea that Big Tech companies have become a feared Big Brother, implying a conspiracy of control and manipulation.",True,"The article mentions Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube as the technology companies that are involved in the conspiracy.",True,"The article talks about how Big Tech exploits privacy, collects personal data, and censors those who do not conform to official narratives.",True,The article suggests that the population is being manipulated and controlled by Big Tech through the exploitation of personal data and censorship.,True,"The article connects various examples of censorship and control by Big Tech, suggesting a pattern of behavior.",False,The article does not explicitly mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Conform or die: Big Tech has become the feared Big Brother, the ultimate thought control machine

In 1984, Apple launched a compelling and ironic commercial that promised freedom from Big Brother mind control. The video depicts humans lining up, mesmerized by a large screen. A woman, chased by security guards, bursts onto the scene and hurls a hammer into the screen. As the glass shatters, the obedient crowd is liberated. The iconic Apple commercial introduced the Macintosh and promised that advances in technology will set the world free from Orwellian thought control.

Since then, American technology companies have prospered, capitalizing on new ideas to spread information and connect people around the world. When Google first came about, internet users were introduced to a brave new world of information search. Facebook helped internet users connect with friends and family in a variety of new ways. Twitter connected people in the moment. YouTube allowed anyone to share information in video format and learn from one another.

Big Tech exploits the population’s privacy and censors those who do not conform to official narratives

In order to grow into the monopolies they are today, these technology companies had to provide free, readily accessible, and easy-to-use platforms. In order to do that, the companies had to sell their users out by collecting vast amounts of personal data on everyone. Forfeiting the fundamentals of privacy, these technology companies essentially forced users to consent to privacy loss in order to participate. The personal data, sold to advertisers and bad actors, can be used to exploit and manipulate the population in ways that people don’t even consciously recognize.

The 1984 commercial that depicted one giant authoritarian screen is now the modern day representation of Big Tech. As explained by PragerU, it’s not one giant screen dictating the people; it’s one way of thinking that dictates the population from the top down. The giant authoritarian screen has been multiplied into millions of handheld phones, dispersed into the pockets of the obedient population. The personalization of the technology is a deception of user control because ultimately, users are only allowed to share information and espouse the beliefs that conform to the official narratives established by Big Tech and their army of content reviewers. All of Big Tech preaches conformity to official narratives or else users are banned (censored) from the platforms.

Apple’s CEO Tim Cook is very open about the speech rules enacted across Big Tech: “We only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division and violence. You have no place on our platforms. You have no home here.” Tim Cook’s ideas are exactly the same as the CEOs of Facebook, YouTube, Google, and Twitter. These ‘thought leaders’ and their tens of thousands of content reviewers will exclude anyone who dares challenge official narratives and leftist belief systems. This is thought control and information dictatorship.

Who decides what hate is? Who decides what division is? Why are Republican candidates like Marsha Blackburn cited for “hate speech” and taken off the platforms? Why are Trump-supporters, Diamond and Silk, segregated and banned from the platforms? Why does the conservative think-tank, PragerU, continue to face censorship of their videos? Why is the incredible reporting of independent thinker, Paul Joseph Watson, censored across social media? Why does life-saving information from NaturalNews continued to be blocked from social media platforms? The list of censored independents, libertarians, and conservatives continues to grow.

1984 is definitely here, more real than ever depicted in commercials. In 2019, it’s conform or die in the online world. If Big Tech censorship doesn’t bother you, keep on with your positive, friendly, and unifying speech. You are free to lookup information and espouse beliefs that do not rock the boat, and for that, your mind is already covertly censored and strongly controlled. If you are unwilling to admit that, then you are blinded by your manipulators, just as the Apple’s 1984 commercial depicts.

That figures combines the 6,589 victims who tested positive for the virus plus another 3,778 who were never tested, but whose death certificates list the cause of death as “COVID-19 or an equivalent”. Probable coronavirus deaths were more common than confirmed coronavirus deaths among victims ages 75 and older. President Trump said that authorities in New York are categorizing deaths from heart attacks as heart attacks caused by COVID-19, and then said this was OK because it was “just in case”. -GEG

President Trump on Wednesday questioned Mayor Bill de Blasio’s revised coronavirus death toll — a day after New York City revised how it tracks fatalities by adding more than 3,700 victims who died of apparent coronavirus symptoms and were never tested.

“I see this morning where New York added 3,000 [sic] deaths because they died. Rather than [a] heart attack, they say heart attack caused by this,” he said during the daily briefing of the Coronavirus Task Force, referring to COVID-19.

Responding to a question about the staggering US death toll, which topped 27,000 Wednesday, the president suggested that the Big Apple added the new deaths to the tally “just in case” the victims had the virus.

“If you look at it, that is it. Everything we have is documented and reported great. What they are doing is just in case — that is OK. We have more cases because we do more reporting.”"

In trying to figure out why the vast majority of his most popular articles vanished from Google back in June, Dr. Mercola has learned that he’s become a Big Tech target due to his procuring of health and wellness information that, in many cases, eliminates the need for pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other high-profit “medicines.”

You see, Google’s transformation into a pharmaceutical company has greatly influenced the search results that pop up during search queries. Users who try to seek out information about “rheumatoid arthritis,” for instance, will no longer find useful articles like the one Dr. Mercola wrote back in 2010. Instead, they’ll pull up pro-drug propaganda links to WebMD, Healthline, and Medical News Today, all of which push drugs and vaccines as the solution to all health problems.

As explained by Dr. Mercola in a powerful video he recently uploaded to his Brighteon.com page, WebMD is owned by the global investment firm KKR & Co., which also owned RJR Nabisco at a time when the company was selling junk food and tobacco products. KKR also owns Medscape and MedicineNet, two other choice websites promoted by Google over sites like Mercola.com.

“WebMD, as you may recall, was in 2010 caught providing users with a fake depression screening test,” Dr. Mercola explains in his video. “The test – in which 100 percent of quiz-takers ended up having a ‘high likelihood of major depression’ and were directed to talk to their doctor about treatment – was sponsored by drug giant Eli Lilly, the maker of Cymbalta.”

653,True,The article alleges that there is a conspiracy by troublemakers to undermine the status quo and that the banking industry prefers a method that benefits them.,True,"The article mentions troublemakers, politicians, journalists, money lenders, economic experts, bankers, governments, and the Labour Party as actors.",True,"The article mentions actions such as alleging, arguing, printing money, circulating money, borrowing money, condemning, promising, persuading, adopting, and forming a task force.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects events and observations to argue for the current economic model and the existence of money hidden in sofas and armchairs.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"It has been alleged by troublemakers determined to undermine the highly popular status quo of nobody knowing what is really going on that recessions are caused by a shortage of circulating money – a relative scarcity of spending power.

The shortage of spending power, they also maliciously allege, prompts people business and governments to borrow lots of money to compensate for it.

Some have argued that the way to handle the problem is to print more money and get it into circulation. However, this method has been roundly condemned by politicians, journalists, money lenders and other economic experts as,

It has long been argued by the banking industry that the second, preferred method of,

“Having the government print money and circulate it is a recipe for disaster and that the really sensible way of doing things is to have banks print money and lend it out at high rates of interest instead.” [Nathan Oligarch, from his book, “Nothing is More Sensible than Fleecing the Proles”]

The inescapable reality is that if the first method were used by sensible people and other criminals, this would deprive millions of needy bankers of easy profits.

Sure enough, it is well known that the second method, used across the world for over a hundred years has produced nothing but stability without any form of recession or austerity or economic travail whatsoever.

Indeed, when the bankers first persuaded governments to adopt their method they promised that “nothing can possible go wrong” and so it has been, with nothing going wrong at all apart from the occasional depression, recession, collapse, downturn and debt epidemic no more that every year or so.

So there is, when you think about it, no reason to change anything or look for ways to do things better because the current economic model could not possibly be improved on at all and is probably the most perfect system in the history of the universe.

So what, then, is causing economies to experience money shortages if it isn’t the failure to supply the economy with an adequate stock of circulating money?

A task force recently . . . er, tasked by the government with finding an answer that isn’t completely stupid has made a not-at-all-stupid discovery that may well solve the problem once and for all.

Extensive research has revealed that money to the tune of bazillions of pounds annually is disappearing into a black hole now identified as the backs of people’s sofas the length and breadth of the land. The phenomenon is known to economists as the Pounds In the Sofa Syndrome (PISS). Consequently a new agency has been formed to investigate and resolve this national threat, the Pounds in the Sofa Syndrome Eradication Department (PISSED).

A random sampling of sofas carried out during dawn raids by armed PISSED agents revealed that,
• A sofa regularly used by a family of five in Leamington Spa had £300 in loose change wedged under the cushions.
• A sofa found on a skip in Waddington in Lincolnshire, when dismantled, revealed that it was concealing two $20 notes, two groats (!) and the equivalent of £9.50 in old Greek Drachmas and American dollars.

It has been estimated from this random armed sampling that there may be enough to pay off the entire national debt lying dormant in the nation’s comfy furniture.

The government therefore has increased the powers of PISSED to form up a national task force that will visit every house in the country and dismantle is sofas, extract the the money and recycle it into the purchase of a nice fleet of environmentally-friendly nuclear submarines or compensatory payments to the banking industry for loss of revenue.

Not to be outdone, the Labour Party has responded with an even more ambitious plan of its own and has pledged, should a miracle occur at some point and it gets elected, that it will extend the task force’s powers to include armchairs in a second wave of helpful raids that the general public will almost certainly be very happy about.

A Labour spokesperson has claimed that the nation’s armchairs may well be concealing as much spending power as “all the money hidden in the offshore accounts of the nation’s corporate Mafia”.

654,True,The article suggests that there is a vaccine deep state that is hiding the truth about the polio vaccine and squelching any negative information about vaccines.,True,The article mentions the vaccine deep state as the actor responsible for hiding the truth about the polio vaccine.,True,The article claims that the polio vaccine doesn't actually work and is causing some recipients to develop polio.,True,The article describes the situation as an 'alarming surge' of people catching polio from the oral polio vaccine.,True,The article connects the use of the oral polio vaccine to the spread of polio and suggests that vaccination programs often create more problems than they solve.,True,The article suggests that the vaccine deep state is hiding the truth about the polio vaccine in order to keep the vaccine racket going.,"If the polio vaccine was really a “miracle breakthrough” for public health, why is it still causing people to get polio?

Vaccine apologists are notorious for claiming that vaccines are the greatest public health intervention ever created, pointing to early vaccines for infectious diseases like polio as “proof.” But an inconvenient little truth about the polio vaccine in particular that the vaccine deep state will never confess to is the fact that it doesn’t actually work, and is still, after all these years, causing some recipients to develop polio.

Oral polio vaccines are “spawning virulent strains” of polioviruses that didn’t previously exist, in fact, though you’re unlikely to hear about this on the nightly news anytime soon. That’s because any truths that cast vaccines in a negative light are squelched in order to keep the vaccine racket going, and going strong.

It’s not just that some people, primarily children, are catching polio from oral polio vaccines. There are actually a lot of people catching it from these vaccines – so many, it turns out, that some reports are describing the situation as an “alarming surge.” The very intervention that’s supposed to prevent this debilitating disease is actually spreading it, in other words.

Oral polio vaccine contains live viruses that scientists have long known cause polio

What makes the oral polio vaccine (OPV) particularly dangerous is the fact that it contains live polioviruses that supposedly match wild varieties. Because of this, there’s always a risk that this attenuated, or weakened, vaccine virus will cause infection, especially under poor sanitary and hygiene conditions.

Vaccine scientists know full well that this is a possibility, and have for quite some time. But it’s rarely spoken about because if the public knew that there was a potentially serious risk involved, they might think twice about getting their children vaccinated at all – and we can’t have that, now can we?

“Researchers concede that an OPV virus ‘can very rapidly regain its strength if it starts spreading on its own,’ acquiring ‘mutations that make it basically indistinguishable from the wild-type virus,'” reports Children’s Health Defense (CHD).

“In other words, there is no meaningful difference between a wild and OPV-derived poliovirus ‘in terms of virulence and in terms of how the virus spreads.'”

CDC expert admits that latest OPV has created “more new emergencies of the virus than we have stopped”

For the longest time, the official OPV used around the world contained three types of wild polioviruses: types 1, 2, and 3. In 2015, however, global public health agencies decided that type 2 had been “eradicated” globally, and thus removed it from the official OPV, converting it from a trivalent to a bivalent vaccine.

This ended up being a disaster, it turns out, as removing type 2 from the equation caused a “spectacular backfiring,” according to CHD, triggering a surge in vaccine-derived polio outbreaks in a number of countries around the world.

The consequences were so dramatic for the worse that an official from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) actually admitted that switching to this new vaccine was a mistake, stating, “we have now created more new emergencies of the virus than we have stopped.”

Natural News actually warned about this type of scenario more than seven years ago, pointing out a study that was published at the time about how an OPV campaign in India caused a 12-fold increase in rates of “vaccine-associated polio paralysis,” as they were calling it, which is really just a cleverly disguised way of saying wild-type polio infection caused by the vaccine itself.

“Whether in Pakistan, Africa or the U.S., it is time to stop equating public health with vaccination and time to admit that vaccination programs often leave new and worse problems in their wake than those they were intended to solve,” contends CHD."

Gold star widow Natasha De Alencar, widow of Army Sgt. La David T. Johnson, released the audio of a phone conversation she had with President Donald Trump in April about the death of her husband who was killed in Afghanistan on April 8 . De Alencar was killed during a firefight with Islamic State fighters in eastern Afghanistan. Five days after he died, U.S. forces dropped a 22,000-pound explosive — nicknamed “the mother of all bombs” — near where De Alencar was shot. Since then, two more American soldiers have been killed fighting the Islamic State in the same area. He was a member of the 7th Special Forces Group.

He left behind five children — Deshaune, 20, Octavia, 18, ­Rodrigo, 16, Tatiyana, 13, and Marcos, 5 — and his wife of 15 years.

Later in the call, Trump invited De Alencar to the White House, telling her, “If you’re around Washington, you come over and see me in the Oval Office,” before asking about her oldest son, Deshaun, who is playing college football at Missouri Valley College in Marshall, Mo.

The phone call was released after White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly pushed back against Florida Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson’s criticism that Trump told a Gold Star widow “he knew what he signed up for.”

 Tearjerker: Gold Star Widow releases uplifting video of Trump’s call after her husband was killed in Afghanistan

Referring to Gen Kelly scathing response to her allegations, “That’s a racist term, too. I’m thinking about that one. We looked it up in the dictionary because I had never heard of an empty barrel. And I don’t like to be dragged into something like that,” Wilson said Friday on CNN’s “New Day.” “The only thing I want to be dragged into right now is getting back our girls who are the victims of Boko Haram in Nigeria.”

 Kelly said the term was meant to be metaphorical, to represent someone who “makes the most noise,” but Wilson took it as racially demeaning.

“You mean to tell me that I’ve become so important…that the White House is following me and my words? This is amazing. That’s amazing. That is absolutely phenomenal. I’ll have to tell my kids that I’m a rock star now,” Wilson told Miami Fox affiliate WSVN-TV, while laughing as reported by Daily Caller.

The DailyWire reported: After she issued a scathing and inappropriate reply to White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly Thursday afternoon, Rep. Frederica Wilson’s staff says she will no longer be speaking publicly about President Donald Trump’s condolence call to a Gold Star widow.

Planned Parenthood is defending Rep. Frederica Wilson’s (D-FL) claim that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s use of the term “empty barrel” is racist.

On Thursday, Kelly lectured Wilson for eavesdropping on and politicizing President Donald Trump’s phone call to the widow of a soldier slain in Niger.

“It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on the conversation – absolutely stuns me,” Kelly said, “And I thought at least that was sacred.” as reported by Breitbart.

An event hosted by Rev. Al Sharpton’s civil rights organization and poised to include anti-vaccine viewpoints in Harlem this weekend was canceled by the group on Tuesday, after physicians and public health officials argued that the event was harmful and targeted the African American community.

When asked about the National Action Network’s decision to host the event in the first place, Sharpton said:
• None ABC: NY State Kicks Boy Out of School Even Though Neurologist Signs Off on Medical Exemptions

The free event was set to be hosted by the president of the National Action Network’s Scholars Committee, Curtis Cost, who in 1998 hosted another event in Harlem sponsored by Sharpton and NAN providing a “both sides” approach calling into question whether AIDS was caused by HIV. The event comes just one month after New York City declared an end to its largest measles outbreak in nearly 30 years, spurring a repeal of religious exemptions to vaccines in the state.



Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the outspoken vaccine-choice advocate leading the effort to sue the state over the repeal of that law, was one of the speakers slated to attend the event. Other speakers included Mary Holland, Esq., Ms. Sheila Ealey and Rev. Dr. Phil Valentine.

Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, and a regular critic of anti-vaccine activists said he was frustrated by Sharpton. Hotez has occasionally appeared on Sharpton’s MSNBC show as a guest to discuss his research on Zika virus and Ebola. He said:

“In 2019 the anti-vaccine ringleaders targeted the Orthodox Jewish community to flood them with a phony pamphlet, hold teleconferences, robocalls, and town hall meetings with fake information about vaccines. Now they have their sights set on Harlem to ignite an even bigger measles epidemic on the African American community there. Why Rev Sharpton would attack his own community in this way defies common sense or explanation.”2 “His organization should not be hosting this event. He should not be appearing at this event. This is an event which is intended to deliberately work towards depriving kids in Harlem of their life-saving vaccines and to make parents question the safety of those vaccines.”2

Dr. Sean O’Leary with the American Academy of Pediatrics also expressed dismay over the upcoming event. Referring to the recent measles outbreak, he said:

Since Tillerson's comments, Saudi Arabia has moved to establish a blockade against Qatar that has been internationally condemned. The Trump Administration has sided with Saudi Arabia in the conflict. It has hypocritically condemned Qatar for supporting terrorism while attempting to ease tensions between the two countries.

Tillerson has found himself caught in a hard place. The US is unprepared to resolve the dispute. In his address, Tillerson referred to the region as the ""Arabian Gulf,"" an obvious indication that he knows little about the geography of the region let alone the players involved. Furthermore, the US has economic and military partnerships with both countries, each of which is non-negotiable from the standpoint of the ruling elite. In a gamble, the current Administration has decided to lean on Saudi Arabia to ease its hostility in hopes that the Qatari monarchy will soften in the process.

The rivalry between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is rooted in complex yet interrelated social relations. Both countries possess autocratic superstructures controlled by hereditary monarchs who claim the faith of Islam as their guiding principle. Qatar and Turkey have become close allies through their support of the Muslim Brotherhood. Saudi Arabia and much of the Persian Gulf region is dominated by an extreme loyalty to Wahhabism. This fundamentalist ideology is less indigenous to the region than the Muslim Brotherhood but has received equal support from imperial powers seeking to divide and conquer the region in their interests.

In recent years, the struggle between these two countries has been painted as purely philosophical when in fact it is much more significant. Saudi Arabia has long sought to diminish the power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Qatar to dominate the region more effectively. However, access to an abundance of natural gas allows Qatar to assert independent political positions when necessary. Qatar shares a large gas field with Saudi Arabia's number one enemy: Iran. The off shore North Field supplies Qatar with its natural gas, giving ample room for Doha to navigate the international arena independently of Saudi interference.

Tillerson didn't mention any of these overarching factors currently shaping tensions between Qatar and the Saudi-led Persian Gulf Cooperation Council (PGCC). His statement on June 9th painted Qatar as the sole supplier of terrorism in the region. Tillerson attempted to balance his critique by urging Saudi Arabia to ease its blockade. But US imperialism cannot stop the motive force of history driving the conflict. Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia are strategic partners that the US can ill afford to lose.

The similarities between Qatar and Saudi Arabia should not be lost in the conflict. Qatar hosts the US Central Command and recently signed a military agreement with the US worth 12 billion USD. Saudi Arabia receives ample support from the US military and its weapons contractors worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia finance jihadist proxies to achieve their own imperial ambitions in partnership with the US and the West. Saudi Arabia and Qatar played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the socialist Libyan government in 2011 and the protracted war in Syria that intensified shortly thereafter.

Yet diligent service to US imperialism is no longer enough to maintain unity among the Persian Gulf puppet states. Qatar understands that stronger ties with Iran can insulate it from the volatile character of the oil capitalist market. Iran's wealth also allows Qatar to diversify the monarchy's source of profit. Russia has also strengthened ties with Qatar in recent years as it attempts to curry favor with Muslim Brotherhood-aligned countries and persuade such forces to cease its war on Syria. The same scenario played out with Turkey, whose support for the overthrow of the Syrian state is well-documented. Turkey has grown closer to Russia as the war on Syria winds down. This complex set of relations is lost on the current US Administration.

The Trump Administration's handling of the inter-imperialist conflict between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is indicative of a larger crisis. US imperialism is rapidly losing control of its political and economic hegemony. Russia, China, Iran and their allies represent an emerging axis of influence that cannot be arrested short of a nuclear war. This axis offers far more desirable outcomes in a period of instability. All advocate for peace and respect for international law. And all want a more stable international order that is friendlier to independent economic development.

The Qatar and Saudi conflict is just another instance where the stupidity and irrationality of US imperial policy is on full display. Syria and Iran are leading the way toward a more independent Middle East despite being the target of endless war. Sanctions and the threat of nuclear war have not deterred other countries from building stronger partnerships with Russia and China. It is the US imperialist system that is decaying to the point of irrelevancy. The future points to a new world order based on the needs of humanity, a development that will surely bring more conflicts like the one afflicting Saudi Arabia and Qatar to the fore.

Come on, now, did you really think things were going to be any different? Let the record show that the very first movie ever produced by the Barack Obama production company Higher Ground, for Netflix, won an Oscar and quoted Communist Karl Marx and the Communist Manifesto while accepting their prize.

Socialism and Communism are stains on the world that have only ever caused poverty, misery, death and oppression. Do you find it interesting that in 2020 we have former president Barack Obama and his minions praising Karl Marx, and the main front-runner for the Democrats for president is Communist Bernie Sanders?

From now until November 3rd I wont stop reminding you that YOUR VOTE COUNTS like never before, don’t waste it. The wolf of Communism is in the wings, and he is hungry.

FROM THE DAILY WIRE: Julia Reichert of “American Factory” received the award and said: “Working people have it harder and harder these days – and we believe that things will get better when workers of the world unite.”

The term “workers of the world unite,” comes directly from the communist manifesto and was widely noticed by media critics. Obama praised them, writing on Twitter, “Congrats to Julia and Steven, the filmmakers behind American Factory, for telling such a complex, moving story about the very human consequences of wrenching economic change. Glad to see two talented and downright good people take home the Oscar for Higher Ground’s first release.”

Communism is an ideology of evil and was estimated to be responsible for the deaths of 100 million people last century.

Such convictions set the stage for decades of murder on an industrial scale. In total, no fewer than 20 million Soviet citizens were put to death by the regime or died as a direct result of its repressive policies. This does not include the millions who died in the wars, epidemics and famines that were predictable consequences of Bolshevik policies, if not directly caused by them. The victims include 200,000 killed during the Red Terror (1918-22); 11 million dead from famine and dekulakization; 700,000 executed during the Great Terror (1937-38); 400,000 more executed between 1929 and 1953; 1.6 million dead during forced population transfers; and a minimum 2.7 million dead in the Gulag, labor colonies and special settlements. To this list should be added nearly a million Gulag prisoners released during World War II into Red Army penal battalions, where they faced almost certain death; the partisans and civilians killed in the postwar revolts against Soviet rule in Ukraine and the Baltics; and dying Gulag inmates freed so that their deaths would not count in official statistics. If we add to this list the deaths caused by communist regimes that the Soviet Union created and supported—including those in Eastern Europe, China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia—the total number of victims is closer to 100 million. That makes communism the greatest catastrophe in human history.

Responses varied online with the far-left praises the speech and everyone else either mocking it or expressing shock or outrage.

Far-left activist Adam Best responded: “The Obamas now have a movie that won at the #Oscars and Trump is still mad over never winning an Emmy. Imagine he’s having a hissy fit right about now.” READ MORE

The “fake pipe bomb” events we all witnessed today are nothing more than Democrats mailing fake pipe bombs to other Democrats.

This is their last, desperate ploy to try to control the outcome of a mid-term election they’re terrified of losing. And with that loss will come the implosion of the Democrat party, the mass arrests of thousands of deep state traitors, and the exposing of the left-wing media as a lying, anti-American “journo-terrorism” operation that despises truth and democracy.

The fake pipe bombs sent to the addresses of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, CNN and others are pathetic propaganda attempts based on “bombs” that look like nothing more than road flares duct taped to kitchen timers. They aren’t even good fakes. They’re so obviously not real bombs that much of the internet is mocking the entire affair, pointing out that even Ahmed the Clock Boy built a more sophisticated bomb (oh, but in that case Obama declared it to be a “clock,” not a bomb, remember?).

“Proper pipe bombs don’t have wires connected to both ends. That’s dumb,” observed Tom Sauer, who describes himself as a former bomb disposal officer. “A proper timer would best be stored inside the pipe, making it fully encapsulated,” he says. “This is nearly the same as a bundle of road flares wrapped together with an old-timey alarm clock ticking away.”

Clock taped to “pipe bomb” doesn’t even have alarm function

According to an analysis by #Anon, reported by NeonRevolt, the low-cost clock taped to the fake pipe bombs didn’t even have an alarm function. Via Gab.com/NeonRevolt:

So, by now you’ve heard that none of the “bombs” delivered to Dems today actually worked.

Turns out, #Anons were able to locate the actual make and model of the clock taped to one of the bombs.

It doesn’t even have an alarm function.

In other words, it can’t count down to anything. It’s literally just to make a “scary-looking” bomb prop.

If that doesn’t REEEEEEK of desperation, idk what does.

Here’s a picture of the China-made dashboard clock, also available on Amazon.com, which shows that the simple clock has no alarm function at all:

With this fake pipe bomb hoax, the deep state Democrats desperately hoped that if they mailed enough fake pipe bombs to each other, they could all blame Trump and proclaim conservatives to be terrorists. But the real violence and terrorism in America comes from the radical Left: Antifa mobs, crazed left-wing shooters at congressional softball games, death threats from left-wing comedians and singers, a constant stream of hate-filled drivel from America-hating Hollywood, the democracy-hating deep state media that pushes fake conspiracy theories about Trump, etc.

Immediate release of the bomb photograph proves it’s all propaganda, not a real forensic investigation

Even more shockingly, photographs of the bomb devices have been almost immediately released to the public, proving the real purpose is propaganda, not a serious law enforcement investigation. If law enforcement were genuinely concerned about these pipe bombs, they wouldn’t be releasing photos to the public.

But, alas, here’s the widely-circulated photo depicting one of the fake pipe bombs:

No Democrats have denounced the rising mob violence of the lunatic Left

Note, too, that there are no Democrats who have denounced the rising mob violence of the lunatic Left. In fact, they are calling for more violence. Hillary Clinton herself recently said that Democrats cannot be “civil” until they win more elections. Maxine Waters has openly called for left-wing mobs to confront conservatives in restaurants and “push back on them” in a way that continues to escalate toward violence. Eric Holder recently suggested that when Republicans go low, “we kick them,” directly invoking mob violence and a kind of gang tactic that’s used to stomp people on the ground. And Barack Obama famously said that if “they” bring a knife to a gun fight, “we bring a gun.”

The lunatic violence in America today is almost entirely owned by the deranged Left. They are the ones issuing constant death threats against conservative speakers; bashing vehicles on public roads when they’re driven by white men; calling for the killing of President Trump on social media; and threatening to overrun the country with armed communists who have adopted names such as “By Any Means Necessary.”

Since the election of President Trump in 2016, Democrats have descended into mob rule and deranged violence. Their effort to now mail fake pipe bombs to themselves and then cry “terrorism!” is nothing more than a lame attempt to distract America from the real source of violence and lawlessness in America: the lunatic mobs of the Left."

Militants previously said the medical staff must leave the country.

“In zones of conflict there is no free will, Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin told reporters in Delhi. “This is a situation where lives are at stake. They did not go of their own free will, but they are unharmed. Our mission advised them to proceed where they are proceeding.”

The Indian staff were reportedly forced to board two buses, which then drove off to an undisclosed location. Akbaruddin said that five of the nurses received minor injuries from cut glass, though he denied they had been caught in an explosion.

The nurses had been stranded in the basement of Tikrit Teaching Hospital for nearly a fortnight after radical Islamists ISIS plowed through the country, and captured the hometown of former leader Saddam Hussein. The fighters, who aim to establish a Sunni caliphate that stretches from Baghdad to the Mediterranean, had been pressuring the foreigners to leave.

“We were politely resisting the militants’ moves,” Sona Joseph, one of the nurses, told The Hindustan Times on Thursday. “But now the tone of the bearded boys is different. We have no other option but to obey them.”

The nurses are among about 10,000 Indian citizens working in Iraq, and they were receiving salaries of $750-$1,000 a month. The Indian government is now helping to evacuate other expatriates near danger zones throughout the country."

Across America, people are protesting the various lockdown measures put in place to slow the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19). However, new data seems to show that these same protests are helping spread the killer disease.

According to a campaign group Committee to Protect Medicare, cellphone location data suggests that demonstrators at anti-lockdown protests are often traveling hundreds of miles to events, often crossing state lines, to join protests. The group says that this widespread movement risks helping spread the virus among protesters in various states.

The campaign group captured the cellphone data — which they claim is anonymized — from opt-in cellphone apps with the help of campaign firm VoteMap. Data scientists at VoteMap used the data to determine the movements of devices present at protests in five states — Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Colorado and Florida — between late April and early May.

While the data only showed movement within the states, VoteMap executive-vice president Jeremy Fair said that many devices were seen to reach state borders, indicating that their owners crossed them.

The data comes as reports have come in of anti-lockdown protesters catching the virus. In late April, one of the leaders of North Carolina’s anti-lockdown protests tested positive for the coronavirus.

“When they started doing antibody testing (select labs) I went and had one done just out of curiosity to see if what I had in Feb was COVID,” posted Audrey Whitlock on the Facebook page of ReOpen NC. “The test came back positive for COVID and negative for the antibodies, so I had a CDC test performed.”

Whitlock, one of the leaders of ReOpen NC, says that she has since self-quarantined in her home ever since she tested positive for the disease.

“After an abundance of caution I notified my primary care physician who advised me on what to do, and I have been in my house ever since,” she added.

Prior to this, experts had already warned that the rallies could serve to actually help spread the disease. In a tweet, Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, stated that he expected a surge of protest-related cases within a month after the protests.

While the data suggest that protests may be epidemiologically significant events, Committee to Protect Medicare chair Dr. Rob Davidson said that “it’s hard to draw a straight line between devices, individuals at these protests, and cases.”

However, Davidson reiterated that the protests still put attendees at risk.

“The behavior we’re seeing at protests carries a high risk of infection,” he added. “We can see protesters are going from a highly concentrated event and then dispersing widely.”

That protests could help spread the coronavirus shouldn’t come as a surprise. Previous research has shown that mass gatherings, such as protest rallies, are potential breeding grounds for respiratory illnesses like COVID-19.

These studies have noted how big international events that draw crowds from all over the world, such as the Olympics, the World Scout Jamboree and the Hajj, usually result in outbreaks of respiratory illnesses among attendees.

What makes it worse in the case of these lockdown rallies, however, is the fact that most protesters aren’t wearing any sort of protective equipment. (Related: Pro-Trump, anti-lockdown protesters demand end to tyranny while refusing to wear masks: Here’s what happens next.)

The lack of protection only makes anti-lockdown protesters much more vulnerable to the disease, facilitating its spread. By doing so, these rallies give authorities even more ammunition to halting them, taking away people’s right to protest, all in the name of stopping the pandemic.

Consider the Source

Denying civilians admittedly needed aid constitutes, in the West’s own terms, a crime against humanity. While in Syria attempts by the West to openly arm and equip known terrorist organizations within Syrian territory included a mandate from the UN that allowed supplies to flow without the approval of the Syrian government. Those “aided,” are now clearly the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (ISIS) running rampant on both sides of the Syrian-Iraqi border.In Ukraine, precisely the opposite is happening. The regime in Kiev is openly raising armies of Nazi militants to go east and mass murder Ukrainians. Referring to Russian-speaking Ukrainians as “subhumans,” the NATO-backed regime is clearly attempting region-wide genocide. Humanitarian aid from Russia, opened for inspection and coordinated with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), has been blatantly denied entry into eastern Ukraine after baseless accusations have been made by both Kiev and their NATO backers that it constituted a “Trojan horse.”

To further poison attempts to relieve desperate civilian populations surrounded by literal Nazis in eastern Ukraine, British propaganda outlets from the BBC, to the Guardian and Telegraph are claiming columns of Russian armor have been seen moving into Ukraine. Of course, their articles only provide photographic evidence of the armor inside of Russia, but none proving it crossed the border.

When considering the constant deluge of anti-Russian propaganda in support of literal, flag-waving Nazis and fascists occupying Kiev and mass murdering populations in eastern Ukraine, one must consider the source.

British propaganda, like its newer but equally deceitful American counterparts, has exhausted its legitimacy and panders to shrinking audiences. Desperately trying to maintain control over the global narrative, everything from cognitive infiltration of newer forms of alternative media, to fabricating entire audiences to manufacture popularity has been used to propagate the agenda of special interests occupying Wall Street and the City of London.

The credibility of British propaganda in particular can be gauged through the examination of some of its most prominent networks – the Guardian and the BBC.

The Guardian’s recent article, “Russian military vehicles enter Ukraine as aid convoy stops short of border,” includes familiar fabrications that have been seen in other conflicts around the globe. It was the Guardian in November of 2012 that claimed the Syrian government “shut down” the Internet, despite all evidence pointing to NATO and its terrorist proxies. The Guardian would write in its article, “Syria shuts off internet access across the country,” that:

With absolutely no evidence, and even with claims by the Syrian government itself denying involvement, the Guardian shamelessly accused Damascus of cutting off the Internet, thus fueling a propaganda campaign designed to make the government in Damascus appear overbearing, tyrannical, and despotic, while attempting to create panic with a “rebels are making gains” narrative.

It was clear at the time that it was not the Syrian government, and since then, revelations published within the pages of the Guardian itself, admit that it was the NSA, not the Syrian government, behind the outage. Shamelessly admitting the truth, with no apology to readers for misleading them, those behind British propaganda understand that the damage has already been done in the timely business of public lying.

In contrast to a more “minor” incident like baselessly accusing Syria of cutting the Internet or Russia of “invading” eastern Ukraine, all of the major British publications and broadcasters participated in the lead up to the US-UK invasion of Iraq on the patently false pretense of Baghdad possessing chemical weapons. Other notorious lies involved the “Houla Massacre,” and alleged e-mails “leaked” from the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

And while a torrent of easily verified lies pour forth from British propaganda, there is another factor to consider when weighing the objectivity and integrity of the British media. The BBC, aside from serial lies including selling the invasion of Iraq on false pretenses, paid-for documentaries, and using intentionally deceptive photographs from separate, past conflicts to depict current events, is at the center of an immense pedophile ring emanating from one of its own broadcasters it harbored and covered up for over many years, and into the highest levels of political power in British society.

Serial child-rapist Jimmy Savile, a long-time employee of the BBC, was protected by the organization despite many admitting “everyone knew” of his pedophilia. In the London Evening Standard’s article, “BBC accused of ‘cover-up’ as evidence from Savile inquiry is heavily censored,” it was reported that:

Indeed, the BBC, while not lying about the world beyond its newsroom, is busy covering up improprieties and horrific crimes within its newsroom. The “integrity” and “objectivity” of the BBC, the Guardian, and in fact, newsrooms on both sides of the Atlantic parroting the false narratives emanating from London and Wall Street, is non-existent on any perceivable level.

So when the Guardian or the BBC claims Russian tanks are moving into Ukraine, and the Russian government is not saying as much, nor is any evidence – photographic or otherwise – presented to back up such accusations, all that we are left with is the credibility, integrity, and reputation of those making the claims – credibility, integrity, and reputation that is without doubt non-existent.

Some Orgonite in the vicinity of a cathode-ray monitor apparently negates the bad effects and especially if one will wear a small orgonite device on the sternum the body's energy field will be shielded quite well. We believe that this is because the hart region is where energy from outside enters one's personal energy field and orgonite instantly transmutes ambient 'bad' energy at this point. --Don Croft

Mannarino explains, “The general public is zombiefied. . . . What the Federal Reserve is determined to do is kill the dollar. We might get a bounce here or there, but that downward trajectory that started in December is going to continue and has no end in sight. We know this because the Fed has said it is going to do whatever it takes to create inflation. The Federal Reserve thinks that making things more expensive and sucking the value out of the dollar means you are going to be better off. Right there you can see there is some kind of twisted mentality going on.”

Mannarino goes on to say, “What the Fed is not telling you . . . is the economy is dead in the water. The cash is not moving through the system. So, they can print or add digits to a screen from here to oblivion and not get inflation if the cash isn’t moving. That’s why we are not seeing massive inflation – yet. There is going to be a moment when all these extra bills start chasing all these extra goods. What’s going to prompt that to happen is the bond market action. Right now, cash is moving back into the perceived safety of debt. The U.S. 10-year yield is plunging. This is positive to the stock market for now.”

On gold, Mannarino says, “Gold has just hit a high for the year, and that is also a trajectory that will continue. Why will this keep going? Let’s go back to the dollar. Investors don’t want anything to do with the dollar. They are dumping their dollars here. We are going to get, at some point, a massive sell-off in the bond market. Don’t listen to Gregory Mannarino on this. Listen to former Fed Head Alan Greenspan. This is what he says, and he thinks the bond market is in a bubble. . . . Greenspan also said the potential for a rapid sell-off in the bond market is very, very high,”

Mannarino contends a rapid sell-off in bonds “will be very good for gold.” Mannarino also likes physical silver and thinks, “It’s still the most under-valued asset on the planet.”

668,True,"The passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in 1986 emboldened vaccine manufacturers and their accomplices to systematically hide the serious damage caused by vaccines and manipulate data to exaggerate the benefits and effectiveness of vaccination. They have also used their money and power to subordinate the mainstream media, medical journals, and front groups to publish and broadcast deceptive studies.",True,"Vaccine manufacturers and their public- and private-sector accomplices, notably the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are explicitly mentioned as responsible for hiding the damage caused by vaccines and manipulating data.",True,"Vaccine manufacturers and their accomplices purposefully and intentionally hide the serious damage caused by vaccines, manipulate data, subordinate the mainstream media, medical journals, and front groups, and publish deceptive studies.",True,The passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) and the actions of vaccine manufacturers and their accomplices have undermined vaccine safety and the right to sue manufacturers and medical practitioners directly in the event of injury.,True,"The author connects events and observations, such as the passage of the NCVIA, the manipulation of data, the subordination of the media and medical journals, and the whitewashing of inconvenient questions, to support the argument that the vaccine industry is engaged in a conspiracy.",True,"The vaccine manufacturers and their accomplices are described as systematically hiding the serious damage caused by vaccines and manipulating data, which implies secrecy and attempts to mislead the public.","As the Children’s Health Defense eBook, Conflicts of Interest Undermine Children’s Health, tries to make clear, the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in 1986 was a watershed event that emboldened vaccine manufacturers and their public- and private-sector accomplices—notably the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—to systematically hide the serious damage caused by vaccines. In addition to making a mockery of pre-licensing safety testing and post-marketing surveillance, these entities have regularly manipulated (or destroyed) data to exaggerate both the benefits and effectiveness of vaccination. Manufacturers have also used their money and power to subordinate the mainstream media, medical journals and front groups, making it possible to publish and broadcast deceptive studies that whitewash questions inconvenient to the financial bottom line.

From multiple standpoints—not least of which is children’s dismal state of health—the status quo is untenable. Three of the most urgent steps to be taken include repealing the NCVIA, eliminating vaccine mandates (making both childhood and adult vaccination voluntary) and addressing conflicts of interest by establishing a fully transparent and independent vaccine safety commission.

The NCVIA has been an unmitigated disaster. As New York University law professor Mary Holland has written, the Act’s passage has allowed the government and vaccine manufacturers to ride roughshod over three important legal protections:
• Free and informed consent to an invasive medical procedure
• Accurate and complete information about vaccine ingredients and possible side effects
• The right to sue manufacturers and medical practitioners directly in the event of injury.

According to Holland, the absence of these legal protections for vaccination is “striking” compared to “almost all other medical interventions.”

The legal protections are interrelated. For example, an individual cannot exercise truly informed consent unless he or she has access to full and unbiased information. Recognizing this, one provision of the NCVIA was a mandate for the CDC to develop (and health care providers to distribute) patient education materials about vaccine risks and benefits. However, not only has the CDC repeatedly dumbed down the materials in a variety of ways, but research suggests that many doctors do not comply with the legal requirement to hand out (much less discuss) them. Instead, providers and the media continue to blandly assure the public that vaccine injuries are a “one in a million” event, never mentioning that 99% of vaccine injuries go unreported. Under the circumstances, no meaningful assessment of vaccine risks is possible.

Research shows that by eliminating consumers’ ability to sue, the NCVIA has had a tangibly negative effect on vaccine safety. After an extensive analysis of nationwide and state-level U.S. data, a researcher reported in 2017 that vaccines licensed after NCVIA’s passage were associated with “a significantly higher incidence of adverse events” compared to vaccines licensed prior to the law’s passage. The researcher concluded that “product safety deteriorates when consumers are no longer able to sue manufacturers.” Repealing the NCVIA and reinstating product liability would not solve all of the ethical problems that permeate the pharmaceutical industry’s business culture, but it could curtail the “free-for-all” environment that has prevailed since 1986 and might incentivize manufacturers to treat vaccines in the same way as drugs and put safety on somewhat of a more even footing with profits…."

It also mentions the deliberate efforts to keep the word 'geoengineering' out of public education and college systems.,"California Skywatch watchdog exposes how clandestine NASA-military programs are poisoning the environment, food and water supply

Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch was a certified U.S.D.A. Farm Service Agency Crop Loss Adjustor working in more than ten counties throughout California. She now spearheads a watchdog group that monitors uncontrolled experimental weather modification programs, atmospheric heating and testing programs, and ocean and atmospheric experimental geoengineering programs Peterson is at the forefront of the chemtrail research field and how the unexplained patterns that scar our skies are “causing detrimental human health effects and environmental degradation.”

In this 1-hour plus video exclusive for Prison Planet.tv members, Peterson reveals how she was first spurred to investigate chemtrails after being alerted to them by someone at the Mendocino County Probation Department. Peterson then began to intensely study the phenomenon and note that aircraft producing the trails would circle the county in a clock-like loop, covering the entire area with a cloudy haze in as little as three hours. Peterson cites NASA studies showing that the chemtrails turn into man-made clouds, exacerbating artificial climate change. However, Peterson states her contention that NASA is attempting to cover-up the true nature of chemtrails and convince people that they are a natural phenomenon, a ruse dutifully parroted by top weather and satellite observatories, who as Peterson explains acknowledge the fact that man-made chemtrails are changing the weather yet still label them as natural weather fronts in their public broadcasts.

Because such vast unapproved and unwitting experiments with our atmosphere are obviously completely illegal without Congressional approval and thorough public debate, Peterson notes how academics and scientists have deliberately sought to keep the word “geoengineering” out of the public education and college system and keep it within the confines of elitist scientific circles, but that the idea is now slowly being rolled out to the public as part of a gradual conditioning exercise.

Peterson shows a map provided by the FAA which reveals how “intra-flights” – mainly of military origin – are causing the chemtrails by flying in loops around counties in flight paths that differ substantially from normal airline trajectories. The flights have no other obvious purpose than to disperse chemtrails because they have no fixed destination, they merely fly around and around in circles.

As proponents of geoengineering like Obama’s science czar John P. Holdren have proposed, blocking sunlight is a primary effect of chemtrailing, and sulphur could be one of the chemicals being dispersed by these trails. As Peterson explains, sulphur has been linked with a host of health problems, which is why California removed it from diesel fuel in the first place.

As we have documented separately, exposure to sulphur has been linked with the following health effects.

– Neurological effects and behavioral changes

 – Disturbance of blood circulation

 – Heart damage

 – Effects on eyes and eyesight

 – Reproductive failure

 – Damage to immune systems

 – Stomach and gastrointestinal disorder

 – Damage to liver and kidney functions

 – Hearing defects

 – Disturbance of the hormonal metabolism

 – Dermatological effects

 – Suffocation and lung embolism

After studying water quality samples for the state of California stretching back some 30 years, Peterson found that starting from 1990, water sources were all registering unusual spikes in certain chemicals at precisely the same time, namely arsenic, barium, aluminum, calcium, manganese, magnesium, lead and iron. By measuring the spikes in these chemicals in the water supply with similar spikes in these chemicals in air quality samples, Peterson was able to conclude that the cause was airborne and that it had to be coming from the atmosphere. Peterson notes that mixing aluminum and barium creates clouds and that NASA experiments based around this concept were coinciding with the spikes in such chemicals measured in water and air quality samples.

This is an enlightening, detailed and documented explanation of how chemtrailing is being conducted, who is responsible for it and what the consequences are for our health and the environment.

Seven analyzes how Blockchain, despite its origin in the NSA, Deep State, negative AI, and dark web, now is triggered as part of the September 23, 2017 Revelation 12 Prophecy to serve as an instrument of the Restoration of Divine Order on Earth.

In the Webinar Seven introduces the ICJ-ICC.org, a meta-organization of officers and employees of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and International Criminal Court (ICC), a key Partner of the United Humanitarian Trust that is sponsoring gold and asset-backed digital currencies to restore the infrastructure, health, well-being, food, energy and water of populations and Nations that have been subjected to targeting and depopulation.

Seven introduces the Digital Reserve and its gold and and fully asset-backed digital currencies, backed by the gold entrusted to the tribal elders of the Philippines for the welfare of the world, as predicted by the September 23, 2017 Revelation Chapter 12 Prophecy.

“The Universal Digital Currency Reserve foundation (UDCRF), an entity set up by the United Humanitarian Trust foundation (UHTf) in conjunction with the digitalReserve, is the Official Digital Currency issuer of the four chosen Digital Currencies in various denominations. All currencies are tracked (not pegged) to the Euro giving us the flexibility to track other currencies for the benefit of us all in times of financial crisis around the world. The coins being issued are as follows:

“This is done in the various denominations available [starting at 10 Euros ($12USD), so that UDCRF can allow all levels of people in poverty, the unbanked as they call them, to be accomodated and to allow microfinance to thrive to assist in lifting the some three billion people out of poverty and allowing them to participate in global recovery and prosperity. It also allows every level of trade and financing to take place from individuals to SME’s, from major corporations to traders, from banks to governments, and lastly for foundations such as the UHTf to fund major projects globally without being hindered by anything and anyone.”

“We have been very pleased,” Carter told reporters during a tour of a polling station at the Rod al-Farag girls’ secondary school in a working class district of the Egyptian capital

He said the election — a three-staged process launched in November to choose the first parliament since mass protests forced former president Hosni Mubarak to quit — had been peaceful despite “some problems.”

“But in general the will of the people has been expressed accurately,” he said on the eve of the end of the polls. The Carter Center is one of the few monitoring group to have had a licence to witness the election, and the former US president will hold a news conference on Friday.

Carter arrived in Egypt on Monday to join a Carter Center delegation of 40 witnesses representing 21 countries deployed in Egypt since mid-November, the statement added. Egypt’s two main Islamist parties have scored a crushing victory in the seats declared so far, reflecting a regional trend since Arab Spring uprisings overthrew authoritarian secular regimes.

The powerful Muslim Brotherhood, the country’s best organised political movement, has claimed the lead through its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP).

It has been closely followed by Al-Nur, which represents the ultra-conservative Salafi brand of Islam, raising fears among increasingly marginalised liberals about the prospects for civil liberties and religious freedom.

Under the complex electoral system, voters have been asked to cast three ballots — two for individual candidates and one for a party list — for the 498 elected seats in the lower house.

On Tuesday, Egyptians were voting in second-round run-offs for the third and final phase of the election. The run-off, which takes place over two days in the last nine of the country’s 27 provinces to vote, is for individual candidates.

The election is to be re-run in several constituencies between January 14 and January 19, after complaints over the conduct of the first-round voting were upheld. The electoral commission has yet to announce when it will publish the final results. source – Breitbart"

Pencil neck Adam Schiff turned all the innuendos, presumptions, and lies to the House Judiciary Committee to further the partisan agenda. Now that the information had been made public, we find that the “bribery,” a tested poll term is not mentioned in the report.

The report also does not lay out any precise grounds for impeachment. Abuse of power is mentioned, but even as Cass Sunstien of the Obama administration declared in 2017, abuse of power is not grounds for impeachment. Ignored in the abuse of power accusation, is that even witnesses agreed that Ukraine had “bet on the wrong horse” in 2016. Nothing in the report shows any specific grounds for impeachment.

There was much hand wringing over the firing of Ambassador Yovanovitch even though even President Zelensky did not have any confidence for her. She was also deficient in any investigation of Burisma during her time as Ambassador.

Yesterday, it was being taken as fact that Gordon Sondland said that the White House meeting was conditional on investigations. Sondland later admitted that he “presumed that was the case as he had no first-hand knowledge”. This was supposed to be a part of the “quid pro quo” that the progressive socialist Democrats are trying to convince the American people was impeachable even though President Zelensky felt no pressure and has said so many times in public.

The HJC is claiming “obstruction of justice” because the President affirmed the executive privilege to have members of his administration not testify. They are falsely claiming obstruction on an impeachment inquiry that had not been voted on and is partisan in the extreme.

Now they are in a hurry to impeach the President without mediating the balance of power disputes in the judicial branch. The White House has grounds that caused the non-compliance, close secret door hearings, selective leaks by Schiff and his cronies, no formal authorization, or compliance with standard impeachment protocol.

The ‘progressive socialist leftists‘ (COMMUNISTS!) whine about the abuse of power for implementing an agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine to investigate corruption. They claim that it is an abuse of power because Job Biden was mentioned during the call.

I noticed that the Democrat’s counsel used the same dodge that the media and leftists have made a talking point. He stated that President Trump asked for a favor and then directly went into talking about Biden, Hunter, and Burisma.

This leaves out the truth that the discussion about Biden was about Burisma and the corruption with the Bidens. And there was a good five minutes between the favor being asked which concerned Crowdstrike, the corrupt company that investigated the DNC hacked computer."

Democrats attacked President Donald Trump over the weekend for a photo of migrant children being detained by immigration enforcement — even though the photo was actually taken in 2014, druing President Barack Obama’s term.

Left-wing celebrities, media personalities, and politicians took to Twitter to rage against Trump’s supposedly inhumane policy of separating illegal alien children from their parents, citing an article in the Arizona Republic and published in azcentral.com.

They rushed to delete their tweets once confronted with the fact that the photo was taken in 2014, when Obama was president.

Others blamed Trump for the policy of separating illegal alien children from adults — though it predates the Trump administration:

The Arizona Republic article claimed, incorrectly, that the 2014 photo was the “first glimpse” of children in a holding facility for illegal aliens — ignoring the fact that Breitbart Texas editor Brandon Darby had already broken the story of unaccompanied minors being detained at the border.

One reason for the policy of separating children from adults appears to have been to deter human trafficking. Immigration officials who were unable to ascertain whether children were actually related to the adults with whom they were caught often placed the children under supervision or in temporary foster care."

JAY: [I]f you are right that Bandar knew this was going on, then he’s sitting, meeting with his friend President Bush regularly in the days leading up to 9/11, and either not saying anything or somehow does. I mean, I know you know there’s a lot of theory--and, I think, a lot of evidence that would at least require an inquiry--that there’s a deliberate attempt not to know.

GRAHAM: Well, and also the fact that it was so pervasive, that virtually all of the agencies of the federal government were moving in the same direction, from a customs agent at an airport in Orlando who was chastised when he denied entry into the United States to a Saudi, to the president of the United States authorizing large numbers of Saudis to leave the country, possibly denying us--forever--important insights and information on what happened. You don’t have everybody moving in the same direction without there being a head coach somewhere who was giving them instructions as to where he wants them to move.

JAY: So that includes before and after the events.

GRAHAM: Primarily before the event. After the event, it shifts from being an action that supports the activities of the Saudis to actions that cover up the results of that permission given to the Saudis to act.

GRAHAM: Let me say, I no longer use the words cover up to describe what’s going on. I find more accurate the words aggressive deception. The federal government has attempted to rewrite the narrative of 9/11 in order to exclude the role of the Saudis from that horrific story.

JAY: I just want to focus on this line: “You don’t have everybody moving in the same direction without there being a head coach somewhere who was giving them instructions as to where he wants them to move.” And that’s in reference to me talking about the various examples of American intelligence agencies that in fact did generate intelligence that could have prevented 9/11 if it had been followed up. And I had asked you if there was a deliberate culture created to the American intelligence agencies of not wanting to know, which in itself could prohibit the sharing of information that people talk about. So who’s the coach?

GRAHAM: Well, I think the coach is the president of the United States. He’s the only one who could have commanded agencies, from the Department of State to the Treasury Department, to the intelligence community, to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, to all act in the same manner, because they are all ultimately responsible to the president.

JAY: If all this is true, what might have motivated it is a real convergence of interests between the Saudi regime and President Bush and Dick Cheney and the neocons around them. We know there’s a document that comes out called Project for the New American Century, which essentially calls for regime change, first of all in Iraq, then in Syria, and the ultimate prize being Iran. And we know the Saudis are extremely motivated to try to overthrow the regime in Iran.They hate the Iranians, and it frames itself as hating Shia. And it’s certainly a convergence of interests between the Saudi government and al-Qaeda that hate Shia probably more than they hate America. And, of course, Bush-Cheney’s stated objective was regime change in Iran. In fact, there was a time when they hoped to go to war with Iran, and perhaps only generals from the Pentagon stopped it from happening, that there was a real convergence of interests to create the conditions of what was called, in that Project for the New American Century, the need for a “new Pearl Harbor”, that they’re conniving in this. There’s no other way to say it.

GRAHAM: A lot of intriguing questions. I hope that we will have some answers. I only hope we don’t have to wait another decade and a half to get at the business of providing those answers.

Airport Security Ignored Pre-9/11 Warnings about Hijackers

 (Included in article above.)

Editor’s Note: See this James Woods interview where he recalls telling the pilot of a pre-9/11 flight where he thought fellow passengers were planning to hijack his flight. He also called the FBI after 9/11 and identified four of the hijackers:"
675,True,"The article suggests that Amazon is engaging in censorship and selective banning of content, while still selling a book by a known terrorist leader. This implies a hidden agenda or ulterior motive behind Amazon's actions.",True,The article mentions Amazon as the actor responsible for banning vaccine awareness documentaries and selling a book by a Hezbollah terrorist leader.,True,The article describes Amazon's actions of banning vaccine awareness documentaries and selling a book by a Hezbollah terrorist leader.,False,There is no explicit mention of a threat in the article.,True,"The article connects multiple instances of Amazon's selective banning and selling of controversial items, suggesting a pattern of biased decision-making.",False,There is no mention of secrecy or attempts to mislead in the article.,"Even after it banned vaccine awareness documentaries, Amazon was happy to sell a book by Hezbollah’s terrorist leader

As you probably well know, Amazon has been on a censorship spree as of late, having removed all “anti-vaccine” content from its Prime service back in March. But what many people don’t know is that this multinational corporation was still selling a book written by a Hezbollah terrorist leader after this massive purge took place.

It wasn’t until Israeli media spoke out against Amazon that the Jeff Bezos-led digital empire finally pulled the book, entitled: Hezbollah: The Story from Within, from its store. But why did it take so long for the world’s most vulturous retail behemoth to stop supporting a known terrorist, even as it was busying itself with “protecting consumers” from the threat of content that in any way questions the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.

According to the Hebrew-language daily newspaper Maariv, Amazon’s continued selling of this Hezbollah book represented “a clear instance of breaking sanctions and helping to finance terrorism.” The paper went on to explain that the book was “filled with anti-Semitic statements and questioned Israel’s right to exist.”

This particular book had been available in English through Amazon for many years prior to being identified, by the way. Its existence, and the fact that Amazon was selling it, only came to light after an official from the United Nations came out during a heated debated with an Israeli official to declare that it was “necessary reading.”

Amazon shouldn’t be banning ANY books or materials, let alone documentaries and Confederate flags

Now, it’s important to point out that Natural News doesn’t necessarily support the banning of any material by Amazon, including this controversial book, on the grounds that our country honors free speech rights and the First Amendment. But if Amazon is going to ban films like Vaxxed that simply tell the other side of the story concerning vaccines, then how can it simultaneously approve of pro-terrorism material?

It’s important to also keep in mind that this is hardly the only instance of Amazon selling questionable items after removing so-called “hate speech” from its platform. As we reported back in April, Amazon continues to promote pedophilia by selling child sex dolls that adults can purchase to simulate having sex with children.

Amazon is also guilty of selling illegal pesticides that harm and kill children, even as the platform has made it a top priority to ban all sales of confederate flags because they’re “offensive.”

All of Amazon’s banning this while not banning that over the past several years just goes to show that the tech giant has absolutely no morals whatsoever, and is simply trying to pander to deranged, virtue signaling leftists who believe that forced LGBTQ child mutilation is perfectly normal, but that homeopathy is evil.

At this very moment, you can still purchase grotesque female bondage contraptions on Amazon that are marketed with racist language like “slave.” But you’ll no longer find any Confederate battle flags that were an important part of American history – history that Jeff Bezos and his cronies are quickly wiping down the memory hole as if they never even existed.

What this all means, to quote the words of Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is that Amazon.com “is now basing product listing decisions on waves of social hysteria rather than anything resembling thoughtful policy.”

“The only rule in America now is that you have to jump on every bandwagon of idiotic social conformity in order to avoid being shamed across social media.”

There have been more than 1900 confirmed cases of measles around the country this year, with nearly 1600 as part of an outbreak in Auckland alone.

Authorities two weeks ago announced they believed the spread had peaked.

There are 864 pharmacists around the country who are allowed to provide vaccinations for the flu, shingles, whooping cough and meningitis, but current rules mean they aren't funded to provide the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.

They've been calling to be allowed to help with this year's outbreak and the Government on Wednesday announced the rules would be changed to allow them to be paid to vaccinate people over 16 years old for measles.

Her death was blamed on the ingestion of a lethal level of an antihistamine, even though what she really had recently had was the HPV vaccine, 6 hours prior to her death.

“According to a news report, Meredith’s mother took her to the doctor for a sore throat. At the doctor appointment, she received the HPV vaccine. Later in the afternoon, the mother found her daughter unresponsive on the floor, and she was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The parents suspect the vaccine as the primary cause of their daughter’s death. However, Meredith’s autopsy report rules her cause of death as inconclusive.”

And we see that despite her death, and recent vaccine, every excuse was given to detract from the vaccine. This is called medical indoctrination and there is a reason for it- money. And to the grieving parents? “We don’t know what killed your daughter, but we know it was not the vaccine … vaccines are proven to be safe and effective. We’re terribly sorry for your loss.”

Global sales for Gardasil, just one of the HPV vaccines manufactured by Merck Pharmaceuticals, were $1.8 billion in 2013- even though there have been 35,270 adverse effects, reported to VAERS, caused by HPV since 2006. It is an inconvenient truth BUT profits from selling vaccines are more important than the dead AND are protected by law; in fact, they must be protected at all costs.

More from the article:

“The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-660) created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). Under this program, vaccine manufacturers (and doctors) are given complete immunity from any legal liability if your child is harmed by their product. This law gives parents, like Meredith’s, few options to seek compensation legally. However, this law does not prohibit you from asking your doctor questions about vaccines or to exempt your child from being injected.

While it is only still taboo to question our doctors about vaccines, the more we do it- the more we DEMAND answers and responsibility- the less taboo it will be. So, starting now, the best thing you can do, the most POWERFUL thing you can do for yourself and your family is become informed. Start investigating vaccines right now.

 Regions with few COVID-19 cases can not have 15 new cases or five deaths on a three day rolling average

 A region must have fewer than two new COVID-19 patients per 100,000 residents per day

 Hospitals can’t be filled to more than 70% capacity – including ICU beds – leaving 30% available in the event of a surge

James Henry Fester, founder for the Scholars for 9/11 Truth and a retired professor from Wisconsin, says he believes U.S. intelligence and Israeli intelligence orchestrated the attacks in order to further American foreign policy.

“9/11 was in fact an orchestrated event that was brought to us compliments of the CIA, the neocons (neoconservatives) in the Department of Defense and Mossad,” he told Press TV.

Their “objective was to transform American foreign policy from one in which, at least officially, we never attacked any nation that had not attacked us first, to one in which we became an aggressor nation, launching attacks to destabilize seven governments in next five years,” Fetzer told Press TV on Friday.

On Friday, the US Congress released 28 pages of a congressional report on the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, which show the Saudi government may have had a hand in the attacks.

The previously classified 28 pages of the Joint Inquiry report also hints at Saudi Arabia’s support for terrorist activities in the US and other countries, but fails to show its extent.

 “According to various FBI documents and CIA memorandum, some of the September 11 hijackers, while in the United States, apparently had contacts with individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government,” the report said.

Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has welcomed the release of the pages, saying there is no proof of Saudi involvement in the attacks.

US President Barack Obama, under pressure from Congress and the public, announced in April that the 28 pages, which have been kept secret since 2002, would be declassified soon.

The September, 11, 2001 attacks, also known as the 9/11 attacks, were a series of strikes in the US which killed nearly 3,000 people and caused about $10 billion worth of property and infrastructure damage.

US officials assert that the attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda terrorists but many experts have raised questions about the official account.

They believe that rogue elements within the US government orchestrated or at least encouraged the 9/11 attacks in order to accelerate the US war machine and advance the Zionist agenda.

I’m not much for the classics like chess or go, preferring the more modern ones. But, regardless, as a person who appreciates the delicate balance between strategy and tactics, I have to say I am impressed with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s sense of timing.

Because if there was ever a moment where Putin and Russia could inflict maximum pain on the United States via its Achilles’ heel, the financial markets and its unquenchable thirst for debt, it was this month just as the coronavirus was reaching its shores.

Like I said, I’m a huge game player and I especially love games where there is a delicate balance between player power that has to be maintained while it’s not one’s turn. Attacks have to be thwarted just enough to stop the person from advancing but not so much that they can’t help you defend on the next player’s turn.

All of that in the service of keeping the game alive until you find the perfect moment to punch through and achieve victory. Having watched Putin play this game for the past eight years, I firmly believe there is no one in a position of power today who has a firmer grasp of this than him.

And I do believe this move to break OPEC+ and then watch Mohammed bin Salman break OPEC was Putin’s big judo-style reversal move. And by doing so in less than a week he has completely shut down the U.S. financial system.

On Friday March 6th, Russia told OPEC no. By Wednesday the 11th The Federal Reserve had already doubled its daily interventions into the repo markets to keep bank liquidity high.

By noon on the 12th the Fed announced $1.5 trillion in new repo facilities including three-month repo contracts. At one point during trading that day the entire U.S. Treasury market went bidless. There was no one out there making an offer for the most liquid, sought-after financial assets in the world.

Why? Prices were so high, no one wanted them.

Not only did we get a massive expansion of the repo interventions by the Fed, but it was for longer duration. This is a clear sign that the problem is nearly without an end. Repos longer than three days are in this context a rarity.

The Fed needing to add $1 trillion in three-month repos clearly means they understand that they are looking out to the end of the quarter as the next problem and beyond that.

It means, in short, the world financial markets have completely seized up.

And worse than that…. It didn’t work.

Stocks continued to slide, gold and other safe-haven assets were hit hard by a reversal of capital outflows from the U.S. In the first part of the aftermath of Putin’s decision the dollar got whacked as European and Japanese investors who had piled into U.S. stocks as a safe-haven sold those positions and brought the capital home."

It is sad that so many born-again believers are promoting worldliness. I certainly don't condemn anyone, because we are all hell-deserving sinners in God's eyes. My righteous rests solely in the righteousness of Jesus Christ which is by faith alone (Romans 4:5). My intent is not to condemn anyone for their personal sins; but rather, to expose those who publicly parade their sins.

American is filled with professed ""Christians"" who do business at bars, nightclubs and other worldly places of entertainment. Elvis Presley lived his life glorifying the works of the flesh. Elvis would sing disgusting worldly lyrics to rock-n-roll rhythms for most of his songs... and then sing ONE gospel song at the end.

The term ""Christian"" was first given to believers by the heathens at Antioch, Syria (Acts 11:26). It was the Christlike testimony of those early believers that caused the unsaved people to label them as ""Christians.""

The average believer knows the TV Guide better than they do the Bible. Jesus warned us not to become ""choked"" by the cares, pleasures and riches of this world...

Jesus spoke of picking up our cross to follow Him. The Bible clearly teaches that those who live godly in Christ Jesus SHALL suffer persecution (2nd Timothy 3:12). No wonder America is going to hell... we have become a nation of ENTERTAINMENT CHRISTIANS."

 ==========================

Dave Hodges did the work on this

 Apparently there are orders to Permanently Evacuate the Gulf Coast

That’s why the area was sprayed with Corexit – to make it uninhabitable and all those who initially sprayed the Corexit are dead.

The idea is to permanently sterilize the Gulf on Mexico and then grow Algae for a New Energy Source.

Even Obama is in the loop – invested in Vangard 1 and Vangard 2 Mutual Funds who are heavily in invested with BP to make this happen.

It is the Spray that is killing and deforming the babies, not the Zika Virus — which, by the way, was patented by the Rothchilds – see previous video on the Zika Virus

The Vatican has used the Banks in Frankfurt to fund them for 1,000 years – “The Holy Roman Empire”

The Frankfurt Banks sent the Bauery Boys to England and they changed their names to the Rothchilds

The Rothchilds then took over the Bank of England using Jesuit Hit Men and they now own most of the world – including the United States Corporation and they control the English Crown’s Stuart Trust Fund.

They then had the United States create the Corporations of NATO and the Euronations – and the European Bank Central Bank

Eurosyschem owns Eurosystem International – which owns SinoHarvest in Taiwan – which makes NALAD under the company name NALCO – which has pulled the ingredients of COREXIT

They could have used Soap to disperse the oil – but the idea here is to PERMANENTLY STERILIZE the Gulf Coast Areas.

So now they are spraying with primarily NALAD from NALCO

Confusing – it is meant to be confusing

NALAD is Trichlofon – which is now used to spray and kill mosquitoes that may have the ZIKA Virus in the Gulf Coast – a Virus patented and owned by the Rothchids and is being spread by the US Department of Agriculture so the spraying can go wide spread.

NALAD from NALCO causes cancer and almost a 100% Birth defect causing babies to be born with small brains.

Most of those currently spraying NALAD will be dead in 2 years and they all signed a waiver that they cannot collect disability or sue the company or even talk about it in any way.

So since the manufacturer is in Taiwan you cannot sue them unless you go too Taiwan and hire a Chinese Lawyer.

Other chemicals being used include Raw DDT and artificial derivatives of Permethrin – which are extremely toxic and all cause cancer and Massive Birth Defects.

The list goes on

We published the video THE CURE FOR CANCER to remove these chemicals form your body.

 ================================

 You know – the funny thing – there is a natural way to get rid of mosquitoes using an equal mix of Vodka and Green Palmolive Soap with a small amounts of Miracle Grow and Epsom Salt. It works very well. So here is the formula:

8 Ounces Vodka

 8 Ounces of Green Palmolive Soap

 1 Pound of Miracle Grow

 1 Table Spoon of Epsom Salt

Put in a gallon jug and spray one acre per month with this and All Plant Diseases go away, COREXIT begins to break down, and Mosquitoes go away.

If you have a really bad mosquito problem then put 8 ounces of Vodka per gallon of water and spray this weekly.

Trichlorofan + COREXIT = One of the most toxic ingredients in the world that takes decades to even begin to break down because it sterilizes the soil with Sulfuric Acid and lowers the PH for generations to come.

Our formula reverses this in about 1 month but it will take years to break down the NALAD from NALCO.

These compounds also kill all living things when in contact with sun light – it’s called Photo Toxicity.

686,True,The article suggests that there is a conspiracy by the government and vaccine makers to cover up the negative effects of vaccines and mislead the public.,True,"The article mentions the federal government, vaccine pushers, officialdom, vaccine makers, and Big Pharma as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,The article mentions that the government has established a fund to pay out claims to vaccine-injured families and that the U.S. Vaccine Court awards cash settlements to families whose children became autistic after receiving vaccines.,False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,The article connects the negative outcomes and side effects of vaccines to the rise of autism spectrum diagnoses.,True,The article suggests that there is secrecy and cover-up by the government and vaccine makers in handling the negative effects of vaccines.,"If vaccines are safe, why has the US gov. paid out $3 BILLION to vaccine-injured families?

Americans are constantly told that “vaccines are safe” and that anyone who says otherwise is a kook, a crackpot, or someone trying to sell something on the Internet.

If anyone is “selling” something, it’s the vaccine pushers – they’re selling a lie.

Not many people know this, but the federal government long ago established a fund specifically for paying out claims to people and families whose loved ones were injured by vaccines. In fact, to date, the government has paid out more than $3 billion in vaccine injury claims since the fund was established in 1986.

As reported by NaturalNews, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, or VAERS, lists a number of negative outcomes due to vaccines, and many of the side effects are actually much worse than the diseases that the vaccines are supposed to protect against.

VAERS reported in 2015, for instance, that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is “linked to febrile seizures, which are a type of seizure that occurs in infants and young children in association with a fever.” Those fevers are generally very high – like above 101 degrees Fahrenheit. And while these seizures don’t normally cause long-term issues, they are nonetheless frightening to parents and can injure the child.

What’s more, VAERS reports that a large group of vaccines including MMR, varicella, zoster, influenza, hepatitis B, meningococcal, and tetanus are “linked to anaphylaxis,” a type of shock that can lead to sudden death. And naturally, many of these cases go under-reported by officialdom and the vaccine makers, or they are deemed as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome deaths.

What no one completely understands is how the overload of vaccinations in the 21st century is a contributing factor to the rise of autism spectrum diagnoses (which is now a greater problem than the diseases we are trying to fight).

Woven into the discussion of vaccines and vaccine overload/frequency is the rising incidence of autism, and while that debate largely rages on the sidelines and under the radar, the U.S. Vaccine Court, also established in 1986, has awarded a number of families large cash settlements after confirming that their children likely did become autistic after a regimen of vaccines.

This kangaroo vaccine court gives the makers of vaccine and Big Pharma in general absolute immunity from being prosecuted for the effects of their products. The government instead handles the cases for them and essentially pays claimants off in a way that really circumvents the true intent of the judicial system. Anyone who’s followed the vaccine/autism/injury debate for any length of time knows that."
687,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions campaigners who argue that EMFs from overhead power lines and mobile phone masts are responsible for cancer and leukaemia ""clusters"" across Britain.",True,"The article mentions the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) on health, including the risks of life-threatening illnesses such as childhood leukaemia, adult brain cancer, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",True,"The article suggests that hundreds of thousands of Britons, particularly children, are at risk from life-threatening illnesses linked to the emissions from overhead power lines and household electrical appliances.",False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey missing information or show intentions to mislead the public.,"Overhead power lines and household electrical appliances increase the risk of developing cancer, according to the findings of an eight-year study into the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs). The £4.5 million study, the largest held into the effects of EMFs on health, suggests that hundreds of thousands of Britons, particularly children, are at risk from life-threatening illnesses linked to the emissions. Pregnant women are also at greater risk of miscarrying. Its findings will be seized on by campaigners who argue that EMFs from overhead power lines and mobile phone masts are responsible for cancer and leukaemia ""clusters"" across Britain. The National Radiological Protection Board, the Government watchdog on radiation, reported last year that its studies into the effect of EMFs had been inconclusive. The latest study was commissioned by the California Public Utilities Commission, which is expected to publish the full report in the next few months. Scientists reviewed scores of previous studies from all over the world, including Britain, and carried out new research in the San Francisco area. The researchers told The Telegraph that they believe that EMFs increase the risks of life-threatening illnesses including childhood leukaemia, adult brain cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative disease that attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Dr Raymond Neutra of the California Department of Health Services, who led the research, said: ""In Britain, hundreds of thousands of homes are exposed to levels [of EMFs] that mean they could be at risk."" Dr Vincent DelPizzo, a senior member of the research team, said: ""People have a right to be warned but whether a major effort to reduce EMFs is appropriate must still be decided."" The first suspected link between overhead power lines and cancer was made in America in 1979. Some reports, however, have dismissed a connection, while others have said that evidence is inconclusive. Until now, those considering long and costly legal action have been advised that it would probably fail because of lack of proof. John Scott, the Conservative MSP for Ayr who led an unsuccessful campaign to stop the erection of more than 200 pylons in South Ayrshire, said yesterday: ""The implications of this [study] could be enormous for the power-generating companies."" If the report bolsters demands for the burying of all power cables, the cost will run into billions of pounds. A spokesman for the Electricity Association said: ""If the Government ever decreed that power lines had to be placed underground then the costs would be passed straight on to the consumer."" Every mile of underground cabling costs nearly £16 million to install, whereas overhead cables cost about £800,000 over the same distance. The power companies could face a string of lawsuits from families who claim to have been affected by EMFs, as could manufacturers of domestic appliances. Martyn Day, a solicitor representing a dozen families who are considering legal action against power companies they claim were negligent, said: ""The evidence has been accumulating over the past 23 years and this sounds a very significant piece of additional information."" Among those who claim to have been affected are Ray and Denise Studholme, who believe that their son Simon would still be alive if he had not been subjected to a strong electromagnetic field in his bedroom. As Simon slept, his head was less than 3ft from an electricity meter and a burglar alarm in a hall cupboard. According to the family, tests after their son's death revealed that the two appliances gave off an EMF more than six times the recommended safe limit. Simon was diagnosed with leukaemia in November 1990, nearly two years after the family moved to their three-bedroom home near Bolton, Greater Manchester. He died in September 1992, aged 13. The family hopes to use the study's findings to resume a test case against Norweb, their electricity supplier. They dropped a civil case five years ago after losing their right to legal aid. ""We faced an uphill battle all the way to win compensation,"" said Mr Studholme, 54, who has retired from his job as a financial adviser because of his poor health. ""If I had known about the electromagnetic fields Simon would not have been sleeping there. Within six months of moving here he used to get up in the morning complaining of headaches and feeling light-headed,"" said Mr Studholme. In America up to five per cent of homes have EMF levels considered potentially dangerous. It is estimated that the same percentage of homes in Britain could be at risk, either because of nearby power lines, internal wiring or electrical equipment. Dr Michael Clark, the scientific spokesman for the National Radiological Protection Board, said yesterday that the board welcomed new research into the effect of EMFs but would not comment on the findings from California until it had studied the full report. Roger Coghill, who runs an independent science laboratory in Pontypool, Gwent, and who has studied the effect of EMFs on people's health for more than a decade, said that he was impressed by the latest research project. ""This is a huge, well-conducted study and people must pay attention to its results. Some power companies have deliberately suppressed research in this field. But in the end the truth will out and here it is. ""We are all on the same side: we all want electricity but none of us wants brain tumours."" Exactly how cancer could be caused by such exposure remains a mystery, however. The strength of the magnetic fields falls away rapidly from overhead power lines - just a few dozen yards from a pylon registers well below the natural magnetic field level of the Earth. Studies of living cells and animals exposed to such weak fields have hitherto failed to reveal any changes normally linked to cancer."

Residents were told to “self-quarantine or go to designated venues to quarantine” after returning to the Chinese capital from holidays.

The measure came as Egypt confirmed the first coronavirus case in Africa.

Over 1,500 people have died from the virus, which originated in Wuhan city.

The notice on Friday from Beijing’s virus prevention working group was issued as residents returned from spending the Lunar New Year in other parts of China.

The holiday was extended this year to help contain the outbreak. More than 20 million people live in Beijing.

China’s national health commission on Saturday reported 143 new deaths, bringing the toll to 1,523. All but four of the latest victims were in hard-hit Hubei province.

A further 2,641 people have been newly confirmed as infected, bringing the national total to 66,492.

Outside mainland China, there have been more than 500 cases in 24 countries, and three deaths: one each in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Japan.

A World Health Organization (WHO)-led mission to China will start its outbreak investigation work this weekend, focusing on how the virus – officially named Covid-19 – is spreading and its severity, director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

The mission, including international experts, will also look at how and when more than 1,700 health workers contracted the virus.

The team consists of 12 international members and their 12 Chinese counterparts.

“Particular attention will be paid to understanding transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures,” said Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme."
689,True,"The article discusses a case involving scientific fraud and destruction of evidence by senior CDC officials, suggesting a cover-up of the link between vaccines and autism.",True,"The article mentions Dr. William Thompson, the CDC whistleblower, and senior CDC officials who ordered the destruction of data.",True,The article discusses the actions of Dr. Thompson and senior CDC officials in committing scientific fraud and destroying evidence.,False,There is no explicit mention of a threat in the article.,True,The article connects events and observations to support the claim of scientific fraud and a cover-up.,True,The article suggests secrecy and attempts to mislead the public through the destruction of evidence.,"An important witness in a case focusing on the link between vaccines and autism has been stopped from testifying.

Thomas Frieden, the director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC), has stopped CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson from giving evidence on scientific fraud and destruction of evidence by senior CDC officials in a recent case.

Attorneys Bryan Smith and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., of Morgan & Morgan, have wanted to have Dr. Thompson testify in a medical malpractice case to explain how the CDC committed scientific fraud in a series of studies, which found no link between vaccines and autism.

After denying the request, Dr. Frieden said, “Dr. William Thompson’s deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of CDC or HHS [Health and Human Services].”

Dr. Thompson is a 19-year veteran at the CDC and former senior vaccine safety scientist at the agency’s Immunology Safety Office, and is the co-author of four key studies that the CDC widely suspects will stop the use of the MMR vaccine and vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal, from being linked to autism.

Thompson’s current position is at the CDC’s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention.

Back in August 2014, Dr. Thompson revealed that the data behind CDC’s principle vaccine safety studies demonstrated a causal link between vaccines and autism or autism symptoms, even though CDC claims the opposite is true.

Thompson says,based upon interpretation of the data:

“There is biologic plausibility right now to say that thimerosal causes autism-like features.”

Shockingly Thompson has claimed that his bosses, including the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office Branch Chief Frank Destefano, specifically ordered him and three other CDC scientists to destroy data demonstrating vaccine induced autism in CDC’s seminal 2004 study (Destefano, et al. 2004).

The data in question unexpectedly showed a 250 percent increase in autism among young black males who received the vaccine on time (before their third birthday) in comparison to those who were vaccinated after their third birthday.

It also showed a significant link between the vaccine and isolated autism, which is an autism that occurs in normally developing children with no other medical problems.

According to Thompson, Destefano called his four co-authors into a room and ordered them to dump the damning datasets into a giant garbage can. The published study left out those sets of data.

This study is now cited in 91 other papers on PubMed as proof of vaccine safety, is the main building block on the idea that vaccines don’t cause autism.

The case in question is to do with 16-year-old Yates Hazlehurst. The case is claiming that Yates is autistic as a direct result of vaccine injuries acquired in 2001 when the vaccine was improperly administered.

Because of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act of 1986 (VICA), which protects doctors from any liability to do with vaccine injuries, Hazlehurst v. The Jackson Clinic is the only vaccine injury case in 30 years that has reached a court in the US.

Dr. Thompson wishes to reveal the scientific fraud and destruction of evidence that occurred in the studies he was involved in.

The problem has arisen due to the Whistle Blower Protection Act, which means Dr. Thompson can not testify under oath without the permission of the director of the CDC, Dr. Thomas Friede.

Hazelhurst’s lawyer Kennedy, who argued before Tennessee Senior Circuit Court Judge William Acree that Dr. Thompson’s testimony was necessary, said:

“Yates, and almost 5,000 other vaccine injured autistic children, lost their cases in vaccine court because CDC and the Justice Department submitted fraudulent science wrongly denying the vaccine-autism link.”

Judge Acree ordered on Feb. 5 that Dr. Thompson should be deposed, accepting the logic of the argument, and following this ruling, Smith filed a formal request to CDC to make Thompson available for deposition and trial testimony.

“Since that original study data is only available from Dr. Thompson,” Hazelhurst’s other attourney Smith explained, “We are very confident that a federal judge will order CDC to make Thompson available.”"
690,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,"Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is mentioned as a source of information and criticism towards the Trump administration.",True,The article discusses the actions and statements of Scott Gottlieb regarding the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) and the need for Americans to prepare for societal disruptions.,True,"Scott Gottlieb warns that the number of Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) cases in the U.S. will continue to grow rapidly, potentially reaching thousands of confirmed cases.",False,The article does not mention any patterns or connections made by the author.,False,The article does not suggest any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"The official infection count for the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) here in the United States currently stands at 106 (and likely a few more by the time this gets published). But according to Scott Gottlieb, the former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the true number has actually breached the “low thousands.”

During one of his many recent appearances on cable news, Gottlieb publicly stated that Americans shouldn’t trust the rhetoric coming from the Trump administration, adding that things are far from “okay” like President Trump is claiming.

In Gottlieb’s view, the number of Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) infections in the U.S. will continue to “grow rapidly,” which means that Americans need to start stocking up on supplies and preparing in other ways for widespread societal disruptions.

By the end of the week, he’s quoted as saying, the confirmed number of Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) cases will likely enter into the hundreds. But there are still many hundreds more cases that have not yet been confirmed, meaning that when all is said and done, we could be seeing many thousands of confirmed cases of the novel disease.

While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is still telling Americans that it’s not necessary to wear surgical protective masks in public, Gottlieb apparently believes otherwise.

“Right now, there [are] probably hundreds or low thousands of cases … that aren’t reported yet,” Gottlieb is quoted as saying.

“It’s a big country, 330 million people, so anyone’s individual risk is still very low, but we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we can start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. We need to start mitigating the implications of this spread.”

Listen below as Professor Francis Boyle drops even more amazing bombshells about the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) that you won’t hear about in the mainstream media:

Gottlieb says U.S. authorities will be able to screen 10,000 people daily by end of week

 As for the U.S. government’s ability to screen Americans for the novel disease, Gottlieb says processing capacity will increase by up to 10,000 people daily by the end of the week. And by the end of next week, he says, that will double to 20,000 people daily.

“That was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs and leveraging their capacity; these are the major medical centers,” he’s quoted as saying. “What we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get therapeutic. We know when it started but we don’t know when this is going to end.”

While President Trump’s travel restrictions probably bought the system a little bit of time to get its plans in order, Gottlieb added, the biggest failure was not getting the diagnostic testing situation in proper order.

“We should have been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game, and the manufacturers who have diagnostic capabilities,” Gottlieb, a current board member of the eerily named Illumina group, which has been involved in coronavirus-related work, further stated.

As we’ve been warning, Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) testing kits have been in very short supply here in the U.S., which is why the official infection and corresponding death counts are believed to be far less than the actual counts.

Meanwhile, President Trump has announced that “progress is being made” on the development of a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).

“I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure,” the president wrote in a March 2 tweet.

The U.S. reportedly bombed a known Syrian military position five days into the cease fire and killed at least 83 Syrian soldiers and wounded more than 100. The U.S. says it was just a “mistake,” but Russia says this “mistake” came with four U.S. warplanes and an attack that lasted 15 minutes. Now, trust between the U.S. and Russia is gone, and diplomacy is largely off the table. Is a wider Middle East war not too far behind? In a word, yes.

The violence is increasing between the cops and the black community after two police shootings in Oklahoma and North Carolina. Is it really the fault of the police that the black community is in such disarray when it has been run for decades by Democrats? There are high rates of unemployment, poverty, crime and children born out of wedlock. Is the black leadership blaming their failed policies on the police? It sure looks that way. Louis Farrakhan says that President Obama has “failed the black community.”

The economy is bad and is going to get much worse according to many high powered multi-billion dollar fund managers. There is no wonder why the Fed did not raise interest rates after saying at the beginning of this year it would raise rates four times. How many times has the Fed raised rates in 2016? Zero, and that is why Gregory Mannarino of TradersChoice.net says the Fed not raising rates really means the “economy is in crisis.”

The first scenario was called LOCK STEP and was described as follows: “A world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership, with limited innovation and growing citizen pushback.”

In this scenario, a virus pandemic appeares suddenly, quickly infecting populations around the world, destroying economies by interrupting mobility of people and goods, and debilitating industries and global supply chains.

This makes it possible for government leaders to take total control over their citizens as a public-health measure – a process the people greatly disliked but are psychologically incapable of resisting, because it is done in the name of protecting them. Thus, the economies and political structures of the whole world emerge as a united totalitarian system with a resentful and unruly population but one that can be effectively controlled by new technology.

We see from this that the economic and political effects of a pandemic were being carefully studied at the Rockefeller Foundation at least as early as 2010. More recently, a pandemic simulation took place at Event 201, which was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This occurred six weeks before the first reported outbreak of the coronavirus. Almost to a tee, it followed the initial phase of the LOCK STEP scenario.

Now this is where it gets interesting, because it deals with the connection between the Rockefeller Lock Step scenario and the Johns Hopkins Event 201. The two organizations have a long history of collaboration ever since 1916, when the John Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health was founded with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Since then, they have become inseparable.

Some of the history of this collaboration is not pleasant. For example, In the 1940s, 750 victims filed a $1-billion lawsuit against the Rockefeller Foundation, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, the Johns Hopkins University, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the Johns Hopkins Health System Corporation, alleging that they were the driving force behind human experiments in the 1940s in which vulnerable populations of Guatemalans were intentionally exposed to syphilis, gonorrhea, and other venereal diseases, without informed consent. The experiments targeted school children, orphans, psychiatric hospital patients, prison inmates, and military conscripts.

Key Rockefeller and Johns Hopkins researchers involved in the Guatemala Experiments also were behind the now infamous Tuskegee experiments in which 600 impoverished African-American sharecroppers were never informed they had syphilis, and were given placebos rather than treatment.

Bill and Melinda Gates now have joined this team and, as previously stated, they co-sponsored Event 201. It is logical that they should come together on this project. All parties involved are obsessed with population reduction. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation granted at least $60-million to the Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health to fund the Bill and Melinda Gates Institute for Population and Reproductive Health that is located inside of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. In their dictionary, reproductive health means drastically reducing the birth rate.

None of this proves ill intent of these parties, but it does (or should) sound the alarm to be cautions when these people and their organizations ask us to trust their judgment and leadership in a health experiment called vaccines, most of which never have been tested for safety and all of which are loaded with toxins known to reduce fertility and shorten lifespan. Could that be a covert way of reducing the population? Think about it."
693,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,"The article mentions actors such as President Obama, the US, Europe, Russia, and Washington.",True,"The article discusses actions such as mass shootings, police shootings, foreclosure, foreign policy lies, economic lies, bombings, and drone strikes.",True,"The article mentions threats such as mass murders, illegal wars, and the destruction of human life.",False,The article does not connect events or specific observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey missing information or show intentions to mislead the public.,"In his comment on the mass shootings at the Oregon community college, President Obama said: “This has become routine.”

So have police shootings of unarmed and unresisting Americans.

So have numerous other undesirable and deplorable happenings, such as the foreclosure on the homes of millions of Americans, while the “banks too big to fail” are bailed out with trillions of dollars, and such as foreign policy lies that have destroyed seven countries, bringing the US and Europe millions of refugees.

In addition there are the foreign policy lies that have brought the US and Europe into conflict with Russia, and the economic lies that shield the extraordinary concentration of income and wealth of the One Percent.

Also routine is Washington’s obliteration of weddings, funerals, and medical centers with bombs and drones. Two days after Obama expressed his despair, frustration and anger over the Oregon mass shootings, a US air strike hit a hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan. According to numerous news reports, at least 19 people were killed, including 12 members of Doctors Without Borders, and another 37 wounded. The US air strike killed one person on the operating table, and intensive care patients burned to death in their beds.

For Washington, these mass murders are only “collateral damage,” nothing warranting a presidential statement displaying despair, anger, and frustration.

Obama says he can do nothing about mass shootings, but he could certainly call off his illegal wars and deep-six his reckless and coercive approach toward Russia before we are incinerated. As Vladimir Putin said at the UN, “We [meaning Russia] can no longer tolerate the state of affairs in the world.”

Putin does not lie. When he says something, he means it.

Somebody in Washington had better listen to this man, because Washington is no longer The Unipower. There are now three superpowers—Russia, China, and the US—and probably in that order.

In America all forms of evil and corruption have become routine. Bob Dylan told us that vice and corruption have become routine: “People’s lives today are filled on so many levels with vice and the trappings of it. Ambition, greed and selfishness all have to do with vice. . . . We don’t see the people that vice destroys. We just see the glamour of vice on a daily basis—everywhere we look, from billboard signs to movies, to newspapers, to magazines. We see the destruction of human life and the mockery of it, everywhere we look.”

Vice is Washington’s signature. A fish rots from the head, and Washington has led our country into vice, greed, selfishness and the mockery and destruction of human life.

The Golden Rule is to “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” Allegedly, America is a Christian country. This means that Christian America is following Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount in a masochistic way. Do we really want other countries to bomb and invade us, to reduce our towns and cities to rubble, to destroy our social and economic infrastructure, to kill millions of us and make most of the rest of us into refugees?

This is what America has done to the world. This is why Vladimir Putin said Russia can no longer tolerate the state of affairs in the world and why he asked America, “Do you realize what you have done?”"

This implies secrecy and attempts to mislead the public.,"“V, the Guerrilla Economist” says we have reached the point of no return in the global financial system. “V” explains, “We are entering a time which I call the collapse point. At the collapse point, there is going to be massive systemic shock. Why? Because you have one paradigm and one system being done away with, which is the dollar. It is going to be replaced by a new system. During that transition period, you cannot expect to trade anything because what do you trade it in? That’s why the Chinese are gearing up their own gold price fix. Once that collapse point happens and the world reels from the systemic shock, the Chinese gold price fix and the BRICS system will be there to fill in that vacuum. That is what’s being set up right now.”

“V” uses an anonymous name because he says if his cover is blown, he would lose business and his global high ranking financial sources. So, what will the collapse look like for the man in the street here in America? “V” says, “I was on a conference call at the beginning of the year. On that call were seven guys and some of the smartest people in the world. They work in various sectors of government and various sectors of the military, and the question was asked what does an economic collapse in the United States look like? The initial, unanimous answer was you can expect anywhere from 25 million to 50 million dead in the first 90 days. I almost fell off my chair. Then they said, it’s real simple. You are going to have people dropping dead from violence, looting, rioting, lack of medication; we are the most medicated country on the planet. People also will be dropping dead from starvation, dehydration and disease. That’s going to kill a large swath of people. If you look at the big population centers: in New York you got 8 million people, in L.A. you got a couple of million. It would be very easy to rapidly build those death numbers up.”

Can you survive the crash here in the U.S.? “V” says, “My people say you need to have enough food and supplies for three months. I say to be safe, you should have supplies for six months. . . . My hope and prayer is “We the People” get this government and these things under control and prosecute these criminals at some point. . . . You cannot stop what is coming. You cannot stop this collapse. It’s too far gone and too far forward. You are not going to stop it, but right now, the race is for who is going to win on the other side. Is it going to be us, the American people? Or is it going to be the criminal cabal that is running D.C. right now. They have already made a pact or a promise to do whatever it takes for them to hold on to power on the other side of this thing. You’ve got to understand, the economy is weak and these guys are weak, as well. They have never been weaker.”

So, does the collapse point happen this year? “V” predicts, “No crash this year. You will have major geopolitical events. The dollar will be undermined. The petro dollar will come to an end by the end of 2015. There will be no market crash this year.”

What about gold and silver prices? Will they vault higher this year? “V” says, “No, but I expect them to vault higher by the middle of 2016.”

“V” adds one caveat to the “no collapse this year” prediction. He says if Saudi Arabia stops selling oil exclusively in dollars or if the Kingdom gets overrun and falls—all bets are off.

Pollock explains, “They are firing them in the direction of China. What is so amazing is the ocean is a vast place. They could have chosen anywhere to launch these missiles from and, instead, they launched them right next to a metropolitan area. So, really, they are sending a message to the people in the United States. More so than that, they are sending a message to the people in China. It’s definitely not directed at Russia. What the government wants you to see is the U.S. is this big powerful military strength type of country. It is in control of the world, and the reserve currency is worth something. We are a strong military power and, really, on a conventional sense, the emperor has no clothing. This use of a last resort weapon, the demonstration of it, is really a sign of impotence.”

Pollock says the global economy is the key to the timing of war. The global economy is in a tailspin, and Pollock says, “War starts when China’s economy implodes. . . . The economy in China is coming to a halt. It’s in deflation. It’s in a depression. All the capital that has been pouring into China has been misallocated. It’s similar to the 1920’s in the United States. The onset of the boom-time and the follow-on depression. . . . People in China want to get out of China. They want their assets out of China. . . They see this is going to be a full blown deflation where debt is going to go bad. People’s commitments are not going to be honored, and they might try to delay . . . bide for time and try the old formula first.”

Pollock says China might be pressuring the Fed to raise interest rates even though the economy is sinking. Why? Pollock explains, “If the U.S. dollar gets stronger, that allows us to buy more Chinese goods. First, the Chinese are going to call their friends in Washington and tell them to strengthen that dollar. . . . This will just make the pile of bad U.S. dollar assets bigger and bigger and will make the crash bigger and bigger.”

Pollock says that the U.S. will go into the biggest financial depression in the history of the world. Pollock says, “Unlike we have ever seen, and it’s possible war is going to be the resetting mechanism. Let’s look at it from the perspective of China. Their economy goes bad and guess what? They are going to say the Japanese are evil. The Americans are evil. . . . Japan sees this war coming. Russia sees this war coming. To some extent, some generals in the U. S. see this war coming. They are stockpiling bullets. They have their heads in their asses in the Pentagon.”

How does gold do in the coming depression and World War scenario? Pollock says, “I wouldn’t sell my gold for anything because it’s going to survive through this crisis. It’s going to survive through deflation. It’s going to survive through hyperinflation. It’s going to survive through war, assuming that you do.”

Warren Pollock also says, “The China economic crash is due to fraud and can only be (temporarily) revived with more fraud.” As far as the economy here in the U.S., Pollock says, “We already crashed and, since 2008, everything that has been done is just propping it all up.” Pollock has many accomplishments in his long career. He was a pioneer of high frequency trading and built the largest private Wall Street trading system around the turn of this century. He is also an expert on cyber security and, in particular, to trading platforms. Pollock is on record, years ahead of time, predicting the housing bust in 2008 and the QE (money printing) that followed.

The disclosure is important because it adds to the body of evidence establishing that senior U.S. officials in the Obama administration knew early on that Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and not a spontaneous protest over an anti-Islam video that had gone awry, as the administration claimed for several weeks after the attacks.

Eric Stahl, who recently retired as a major in the U.S. Air Force, served as commander and pilot of the C-17 aircraft that was used to transport the corpses of the four casualties from the Benghazi attacks – then-U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, information officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods – as well as the assault’s survivors from Tripoli to the safety of an American military base in Ramstein, Germany.

In an exclusive interview on Fox News’ “Special Report,” Stahl said members of a CIA-trained Global Response Staff who raced to the scene of the attacks were “confused” by the administration’s repeated implication of the video as a trigger for the attacks, because “they knew during the attack…who was doing the attacking.” Asked how, Stahl told anchor Bret Baier: “Right after they left the consulate in Benghazi and went to the [CIA] safehouse, they were getting reports that cell phones, consulate cell phones, were being used to make calls to the attackers’ higher ups.”

A separate U.S. official, one with intimate details of the bloody events of that night, confirmed the major’s assertion. The second source, who requested anonymity to discuss classified data, told Fox News he had personally read the intelligence reports at the time that contained references to calls by terrorists – using State Department cell phones captured at the consulate during the battle – to their terrorist leaders. The second source also confirmed that the security teams on the ground received this intelligence in real time.

Major Stahl was never interviewed by the Accountability Review Board, the investigative panel convened, pursuant to statute, by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as the official body reviewing all the circumstances surrounding the attacks and their aftermath. Many lawmakers and independent experts have criticized the thoroughness of the ARB, which also never interviewed Clinton.

In his interview on “Special Report,” Stahl made still other disclosures that add to the vast body of literature on Benghazi – sure to grow in the months ahead, as a select House committee prepares for a comprehensive probe of the affair, complete with subpoena power. Stahl said that when he deposited the traumatized passengers at Ramstein, the first individual to question the CIA security officers was not an FBI officer but the senior State Department diplomat on the ground.

“They were taken away from the airplane,” Stahl said. “The U.S. ambassador to Germany [Philip D. Murphy] met us when we landed and he took them away because he wanted to debrief them that night.” Murphy stepped down as ambassador last year. A message left with Sky Blue FC, a private company in New Jersey with which Murphy is listed online as an executive officer, was not immediately returned.

Stahl also contended that given his crew’s alert status and location, they could have reached Benghazi in time to have played a role in rescuing the victims of the assault, and ferrying them to safety in Germany, had they been asked to do so. “We were on a 45-day deployment to Ramstein air base,” he told Fox News. “And we were there basically to pick up priority missions, last-minute missions that needed to be accomplished.”

“You would’ve thought that we would have had a little bit more of an alert posture on 9/11,” Stahl added. “A hurried-up timeline probably would take us [an] hour-and-a-half to get off the ground and three hours and fifteen minutes to get down there. So we could’ve gone down there and gotten them easily.”

I’m not holding my breath that Hillary or Obama will truthfully respond to this report. What difference at this point does it make?"

It also mentions the denial of knowledge by the companies involved.,"The National Security Agency has obtained direct access to the systems of Google, Facebook, Apple and other US internet giants, according to a top secret document obtained by the Guardian.

The NSA access is part of a previously undisclosed program called PRISM, which allows officials to collect material including search history, the content of emails, file transfers and live chats, the document says.

The Guardian has verified the authenticity of the document, a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation – classified as top secret with no distribution to foreign allies – which was apparently used to train intelligence operatives on the capabilities of the program. The document claims “collection directly from the servers” of major US service providers.

Although the presentation claims the program is run with the assistance of the companies, all those who responded to a Guardian request for comment on Thursday denied knowledge of any such program.

In a statement, Google said: “Google cares deeply about the security of our users’ data. We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully. From time to time, people allege that we have created a government ‘back door’ into our systems, but Google does not have a back door for the government to access private user data.”

Several senior tech executives insisted that they had no knowledge of PRISM or of any similar scheme. They said they would never have been involved in such a program. “If they are doing this, they are doing it without our knowledge,” one said.

An Apple spokesman said it had “never heard” of PRISM. The NSA access was enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under Obama in December 2012.

The program facilitates extensive, in-depth surveillance on live communications and stored information. The law allows for the targeting of any customers of participating firms who live outside the US, or those Americans whose communications include people outside the US.

It also opens the possibility of communications made entirely within the US being collected without warrants.

Disclosure of the PRISM program follows a leak to the Guardian on Wednesday of a top-secret court order compelling telecoms provider Verizon to turn over the telephone records of millions of US customers.

The participation of the internet companies in PRISM will add to the debate, ignited by the Verizon revelation, about the scale of surveillance by the intelligence services. Unlike the collection of those call records, this surveillance can include the content of communications and not just the metadata.

Some of the world’s largest internet brands are claimed to be part of the information-sharing program since its introduction in 2007

Microsoft – which is currently running an advertising campaign with the slogan “Your privacy is our priority” – was the first, with collection beginning in December 2007.

It was followed by Yahoo in 2008; Google, Facebook and PalTalk in 2009; YouTube in 2010; Skype and AOL in 2011; and finally Apple, which joined the program in 2012. The program is continuing to expand, with other providers due to come online.

Collectively, the companies cover the vast majority of online email, search, video and communications networks. source – Guardian UK"

Several Tesla cars and other vehicles burn so hot nothing can put out the fire. Foam and water simply turn to steam.

 

 Here is a page from the cargo manifest - listing 1,990 (Kg?) chargeable weight for a shipment of lithium-ion batteries.

 

 1,990 is in kilograms equals 4,387 POUNDS of lithium-ion batteries - more than 2 tons.

 

 Some may counterclaim that smoke detectors would alert the crew to a fire. But perhaps not. Maybe smoke detector(s) malfunctioned on the flight, the fire destroyed the fire warning system wiring or smoke and detectors did could not detect the fire where it broke out.

 

 It's very hard to comprehend the market value of this big lithium battery shipment. A aircraft fire would give both the lithium-ion battery industry and the manufacturer a bad reputation if just one related fire brings down a aircraft. Perhaps this is why the cockpit voice was edited? Without a doubt, a lithium fire is hot enough to ignite aluminum all aircraft is constructed of.

 

 In the USA, it is FORBIDDEN by FAA regulations to ship any lithium-ion batteries on a commercial flight due to the threat of fire.

 

 Aluminum melts at 1,221F. Lithium burns far hotter, around 2,000F. Aluminum will catch fire if heated hot enough.

 

 From a scientific paper we learn what can happen to any lithium battery:

 

 If the battery is undergoing a thermal runaway reaction then a explosion or fire is inescapable. In normal use of the battery, the temperature is below 40C. But abusing a cell with a short circuit, overcharge, apply reverse polarity or expose to high temperature, will cause the temperature to rise quickly. When the temperature exceeds 66.5C, more reactions occur and generate more heat to quicken self heating reaction. 

 

 Thereafter, if the temperature is over 75C, then the reaction will continue with no return to normal. With increased chain reaction gas and heat are accumulated. Once the inner pressure exceeds the battery endurance, explosion is inescapable. Fragments can easy be ignited and cause fire. [1]

 

 NOTE: Temperatures over 75C is the run-away temperature for lithium batteries - just 167F. Cars, vans and trucks can almost reach this temperature under a hot summer hot sun. 

 

 Even if the flight crew discovered the fire in time, it's unlikely they could get close enough to put it out. Note the FIRE warning stated on the manifest for the shipment below:"

Watch and decide.

I understand that emotions around the nation are raw right now with the stunning and tragic death of Kobe Bryant, his daughter GiGi, and the others people on-board the helicopter that crashed in Calabasas yesterday morning. We are praying for the loved ones of those left behind, and are asking God to send them comfort and healing.

“For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.” Mark 4:22 (KJB)

But the news goes on, and today we bring you a stunning video clip from a Chamberlain Heights cartoon from 2017 that showed Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash that takes his life. This is called predictive programming, and it is a favorite tool of the Illuminati and global elites.

For those of you who do not know what predictive programming is, here are a few examples:
• Trilateral Commission and New World Order Exposed In 1981 Episode Of Barney Miller

Get the picture? And there are dozens more examples of predictive programming than the few I just gave you. One of the most stunning of all is President George H.W. Bush calling for the establishment of the New World Order tens years to the day before the Twin Towers were brought down in New York City. The Illuminati and global elites make their plans years in advance and they love to leave clues behind for people to connect the dots.

This video we are about to show you is quite chilling for two reasons. One, it accurately depicts how Kobe Bryant would die two full years before the event took place. Two, when you watch the cartoon, they seem to be implying that Kobe’s death was the price he had to pay for becoming immensely wealthy and powerful. There are those who say that you can only reach that level by making a deal with the Illuminati, and when you do, eventually a price must be made in the form of a human sacrifice. In this case, it was Kobe and his daughter who were “sacrificed”.

I was an actor in Hollywood for 6 years, and I absolutely agree with the idea that it is the Devil and the forces of darkness who promise people wealth and fame in exchange for their souls. There is so much happening there with child sex rings, sex slaves, witchcraft, demonology, the Illuminati, things you wouldn’t believe actually, but they are true. If you would like proof of that, visit our GODLESS HOLLYWOOD section to have you illusions shattered and your eyes opened to the truth. I was skeptical of the idea of predictive programming when I first heard about it years ago, but since then, I think predictive programming is very real indeed.

What happened yesterday in the helicopter crash could have just been a tragic accident, or it could have been a targeted hit by the Illuminati demanding a sacrifice. At this point, I could make and equally compelling case for either side. You watch the video and decide for yourself.

In another stunning example of predictive programming, cartoon Chamberlain Heights showed Kobe Bryant dying in a helicopter crash and explosion back in 2017. As did the cryptic tweet from .Noso (@dotNoso) from 2012.

The Simpsons is the longest-running cartoon in history and crazy popular to boot. What better place to use predictive programming?

So, here we are today. Like the Romans of Crassus' and Cicero's time, or the Germans under a newly elected Hitler, we are being warned that a dangerous enemy threatens us, implacable, invisible, omnipresent, and invulnerable as long as our government is hamstrung by that silly old Bill of Rights. Already there have appeared articles debating whether or not ""extraordinary measures"" (i.e. torture) are not fully justified under certain circumstances such as those we are purported to face. As was the case in Rome and Germany, the government continues to plead with the public for an expansion of its power and authority, to ""deal with the crisis"". However, as Casio watch timers are paraded before the cameras, to the stentorian tones of the talking heads' constant dire warnings, it is legitimate to question just how real the crises is, and how much is the result of political machinations by our own leaders. Are the terrorists really a threat, or just hired actors with bombs and Casio watches, paid for by Cicero and given brown shirts to wear by Hitler? Is terrorism inside the United States really from outside, or is it a stage managed production, designed to cause Americans to believe they have no choice but to surrender the Republic and accept the totalitarian rule of a new emperor, or a new Fuhrer? Once lost, the Romans never got their Republic back. Once lost, the Germans never got their Republic back. In both cases, the nation had to totally collapse before freedom was restored to the people.

While we have been hoping that this period of staying at home was nearing its end, many are not convinced it is.

According to Neel Kashkari, we have a ‘long hard road ahead of us.’ In an interview with CBS recently Kashkari said that the US should be looking at an 18-month strategy for shutdowns. While Kashkari noted that this kind of thing would be a big hit for our economy, he also seems to think it would be almost unavoidable ‘barring some health-care miracle.’ Sure, the idea of being stuck at home for longer isn’t one we want to face but perhaps it’s what we should do?

In Kashkari’s interview with CBS he said as follows:

“We could have these waves of flareups, controls, flareups, and controls until we actually get a therapy or a vaccine,”

“We need to find ways of getting the people who are healthy, who are at lower risk back to work and then providing the assistance to those who are most at risk, who are going to need to be quarantined or isolated for the foreseeable future.”

“This could be a long, hard road that we have ahead of us until we get to either an effective therapy or a vaccine,”

“It’s hard for me to see a V-shaped recovery under that scenario.”

While this might come as a shock to some, others are all for it as it seems to be one of the only ways to truly get things under control. Sure, right now we don’t know what will actually happen but a longer shutdown is something we should be aware of. Of course, this in itself would be hard but we as a whole could make it through even if it hit the economy as drastically as it likely would.

CBS wrote as follows on this topic:

Kashkari, who oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program during the 2008 financial crisis, said Congress has been “very aggressive” in its response to the coronavirus, but warned lawmakers may have to do more to prop up the economy until a vaccine is ready.

“It goes back to the progression of the virus,” he said. “If we’re going to have economic distress until we have a vaccine, then it’s going to be up to Congress to keep coming back to provide support to the American people.”

Kashkari said the nation should be looking at an 18-month strategy for the economy and health care system based on other countries further along in their recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, and acknowledged that while the U.S. economy cannot be shut down for that long, officials need to identify ways for those who are not infected with the coronavirus to return safely to work.

“We need to find ways of getting the people who are healthy, who are at lower risk back to work and then providing the assistance to those who are most at risk, who are going to need to be quarantined or isolated for the foreseeable future,” he said. “That’s a real challenge for all of us.”

President Trump has signaled an eagerness to reopen the U.S. economy, the strength of which was central to his reelection campaign, and discussions have started shifting toward what a return to normalcy may look like. Public health officials, however, have urged Americans not to let up on the aggressive social distancing measures taken to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which they acknowledge are having positive effects.

While Kashkari doesn’t think everyone should be quarantined or isolated, he does think those most at risk need to continue dealing with this in an extreme manner until a vaccine is found. He says that while it is a challenge for us we need to find a way of getting the people who are healthy and lower at risk back to work while still assisting those who are considered ‘most at risk.’ Those specific people will be quarantined likely for the ‘foreseeable future.’ To hear this interview for yourself check out the video below."

Morgan asked for Trump’s thoughts on then-Congressman Anthony Weiner’s (D-NY) scandal, which was the first Weiner scandal (see “Weiner’s naked weiner hits the web”). There would be a second Anthony Weiner scandal in 2016 in the midst of the presidential campaign.

In the 2011 interview, Morgan asked Donald Trump what he thought about the Weiner scandal.

Trump said, beginning at the 0:26 mark in the video below, which was uploaded by CNN to YouTube on June 1, 2011:

I repeated that segment many times to make sure I correctly heard Trump say “pizzagate”. Did you also hear Trump say “pizzagate”?

As Alexandra Bruce of Forbidden Knowledge TV points out:

There was a WeinerGate in 2011 before there was a WeinerGate in 2016 – but as far as I know, there was no “PizzaGate” until 2016. Yet, Trump clearly uses the term “PizzaGate” here, in 2011! This is more than five years before this neologism entered the English vocabulary, as far as I know, with the revelations in WikiLeaks’ Podesta emails and in the Instagram posts of that pizza shop owner, who GQ Magazine mysteriously called the “49th most powerful” man in Washington, DC, which triggered an online citizens’ investigation into their possible relationships to pedophile ring operating in DC…. Mandela Effect? Pre-planned psyop? Or coincidental slip of the tongue?

Piers Morgan left CNN in 2014, which means the video of the interview could not have taken place after 2014.

Did élites-in-the-know like Donald Trump know about D. C. pedophilia years before the American people?

The answer is “yes” if we go by a tweet the late Andrew Breitbart posted on Feb. 4, 2011, in which he called John Podesta a “cover-upperer” for a “world class underage sex slave op[eration]”. (See “What Andrew Breitbart said about John Podesta”)

I am also reminded of what Joan Rivers wearily told a reporter two months before she died from a routine throat procedure: “We all know” Obama is gay and Michelle is a transgender.

But even if Trump had known about the D.C. pedophiles in 2011, why would he, in the CNN interview, say “I was watching between pizzagate and Anthony Weinergate”? Was Trump keeping tabs on the D.C. pedophiles way back in 2011?

In case you missed it, Schiff recently wrote a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asking him to remove all products and content from the company’s global platforms that in any way “discourage[s] parents from vaccinating their children,” calling freedom of vaccine speech “a direct threat to public health … reversing progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases.”

Schiff noted in his letter to Bezos that Amazon is “in a unique position to shape consumption” – meaning it has the power to control the narrative and steer its customers towards a more politically-correct mindset about vaccines, which is what Schiff wants. And as we recently reported, Bezos has decided to comply.

A number of science books, documentary films – including the highly-acclaimed Vaxxed – and other similar-type content have already been scrubbed from Amazon Prime, as Bezos, Schiff and the rest of their techno-fascist ilk are now openly engaging in a massive online “book burning.”

Even though Schiff isn’t a doctor and knows nothing about immunology or the science behind vaccine safety and efficacy, he’s decided to lead the charge in pushing the fake news narrative that all vaccines are 100 percent safe and effective – and that any online materials suggesting otherwise need to be banned.

“I am concerned by the report that Amazon accepts paid advertising that contains deliberate misinformation about vaccines; promoting these advertisements as suggested content ahead of intended search results,” Schiff is quoted as saying.

“Every online platform, including Amazon, must act responsibly and ensure that they do not contribute to this growing public health catastrophe.”

What do “Russian collusion,” “all vaccines are safe and effective,” and Adam Schiff have in common? They’re ALL hoaxes

Amazon isn’t the only tech company in Schiff’s crosshairs, it’s important to note. The Russian collusion hoaxster also sent similar letters both to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, encouraging them to remove all content that “discourages parents from vaccinating their children.”

Schiff also introduced a resolution back in 2015 called “Vaccines Save Lives” that calls for all of Congress to “acknowledge” that vaccines and immunizations are “important.” It further claims to represent “a message of unequivocal Congressional support for vaccines,” urging parents to “follow scientific evidence and the consensus of medical experts in favor of timely vaccination for the well-being of their children and surrounding communities.”

The hilarity of Schiff’s petition to “scientific evidence” concerning the alleged safety and efficacy of vaccines is glaringly ironic, considering this is the same Schiff who simply can’t accept the fact that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, despite the abundance of evidence presented in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s lengthy report.

Somehow this plethora of proof completely vindicating and exonerating President Trump of all accused wrongdoing concerning his alleged connections to Russia isn’t enough for Schiff, whose tin foil hat would seem to be permanently fixed to his conspiracy-consumed skull.

Schiff is so completely unhinged and detached from reality at this point that many are now calling for his immediate resignation from Congress, highlighting the fact that he’s been “completely compromised” by what can only be described as deranged lunacy.

If anything, Schiff is the one who’s got a major collusion problem, not only with far-Left Democrats trying to perform a coup against our Commander-in-Chief, but also with Big Pharma, from which he’s clearly on the financial dole.

Even though there’s no evidence whatsoever of collusion, Schiff stated the exact opposite during a recent interview with George Stephanopolous, declaring that there’s “significant evidence of collusion.”

Schiff is also declaring the opposite of what’s true about vaccines, which have never been proven safe or effective as he and many other vaccine apologists routinely claim. In Schiff’s world, vaccines represent medical perfection, and anyone who believes otherwise needs to be silenced.

When it comes to hoaxes, in other words, Schiff is public enemy number one in both manufacturing and propagating them for a living – which means Schiff himself is a hoax. He’s certainly a hoax of a representative, as Americans are no longer buying the lies he’s trying to sell them.

“The scholarly and clinical data that Schiff (and many others) wants to ban and burn, contain important warnings about the multitude of well-documented, preventable vaccine-related deaths, disabilities and autoimmune disorders that have been caused by the inherently dangerous, inherently toxic, intramuscularly-injected vaccine ingredients such as the neurotoxic mercury and the autoimmunity-inducing aluminum as well as the encephalopathic and other disease-producing live viruses that are known to cause both sub-clinical and full-blown infections among close contacts,” writes Dr. Gary G. Kohls, M.D., for the Duluth Reader.

“Schiff’s plan (along with Big Pharma and BBC efforts in Great Britain to make speaking out about vaccine damages and deaths a hate crime [!]) would eventually lead to the criminalization of millions of honest, intelligent victims of Big Vaccine’s products who would refuse to keep silent about their provable truths. Schiff’s plan would also violate the freedom of speech clause of the U.S. Constitution’s Bill of Rights. Shame on him.”"

The vaccine debate has been simmering for years, but two recent developments have turned the heat up around this issue dramatically in the past few months.

First, the World Health Organization has declared “vaccine skeptics” – people who are cautious about receiving vaccines for ethical, health or other reasons – as a “global health threat” on the same level as Ebola, superbugs, HIV, air pollution and global warming. Then, a national measles “outbreak” was declared in the United States after 228 people contracted the disease, creating widespread hysteria in North America.

The media and regulatory authorities use this type of hysteria to push the narrative that vaccines save lives and have reduced mortality rates dramatically over the past 100 years. People who do not vaccinate, they therefore insist, are selfish and ignorant. But are they telling the whole, unvarnished truth? While it is an undisputed fact that health outcomes for the majority of Americans have improved dramatically over the past century, scientific data do not confirm that vaccines are responsible for this dramatic reduction in mortality rates.

As reported by the organization, Children’s Health Defense, mortality rates have dropped a staggering 74 percent since 1900. Experts agree that the greatest reason for this drop is a significant reduction in the number of deaths from infectious diseases.

What many health practitioners and regulatory agencies do not acknowledge to the public, however, is that this reduction in infectious disease is not the result of vaccinations.

To understand the real cause of this massive improvement in general health it is necessary to look back at what living conditions were like around the turn of the 20th century.

At that time, hundreds of thousands of poor immigrants had arrived in the U.S.A. desperate to escape grinding poverty in their home countries. The majority of immigrants were herded into apartment-like living areas known as tenements, which generally consisted of a kitchen and one bathroom. Rooms often had no windows, and multiple people lived together in stifling, unhygienic conditions. There was no running water, sewage management or garbage removal. Rubbish was piled up everywhere and it was very difficult for people to bathe or properly wash their clothing. The result? Disease – and lots of it.

As socio-economic conditions improved dramatically and quickly in the first few decades of the 1900s, however, with sewerage and garbage management systems established, running water becoming increasingly accessible, and laws that improved living conditions in general, the health of people quickly improved. Long before the majority of vaccines became available, therefore, morbidity rates had already decreased dramatically.

What they aren’t telling you

Back in 1970, Dr. Edward H. Kass, then-president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, gave a speech in which he showed his colleagues charts depicting how deaths from infectious diseases like measles and whooping cough had dropped dramatically before vaccines against these diseases were even created.

He also pointed out that incidences of Scarlett Fever – for which there has never been a vaccine – diminished just as dramatically as other infectious diseases.

Dr. Kass warned at the time that the idea that “medical research and our superior system of medical care were major factors extending life expectancy” were nothing more than half truths that could prevent the medical establishment from continuing to search for the real reasons behind reductions in mortality.

“This decline in rates of certain disorders, correlated roughly with socioeconomic circumstances, is merely the most important happening in the history of the health of man,” he noted, “yet we have only the vaguest and most general notions about how it happened and by what mechanisms socioeconomic improvement and decreased rates of certain diseases run in parallel.”

Then, a 1977 study known as the McKinlay Study, which was viewed as the seminal work on the role of vaccines in the decline in mortality rates, concluded:

[T]he introduction of specific medical measures and/or the expansion of medical services are generally not responsible for most of the modern decline in mortality.

The researchers concluded that all medical interventions – including vaccines – were only responsible for between 1 and 3.5 percent of the total reduction in mortality rate since 1900.

Finally, a study published in 2000 in the journal Pediatrics, conducted by researchers from Johns Hopkins and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found:

Thus vaccination does not account for the impressive declines in mortality seen in the first half of the century…nearly 90% of the decline in infectious disease mortality among US children occurred before 1940, when few antibiotics or vaccine were available.

So, no, vaccines did not dramatically decrease mortality rates in the 1900s, no matter what you may have been told. Which leads to the question: What else are they hiding?

If unelected self-appointed bureaucrats (ultimately answering to George Soros) run foreign policy with virtually unlimited budgets regardless of who is President, there is little left for a Commander in Chief to do.

They have created horrible wars to destabilise the globe – none of which have done anything other than drain the nation’s coffers and fill its body-bags and coffins with America’s youth.

The Serpents Hiding in the Rainbow

The Senate Homeland Security Committee must take this public information which The Pickering Post, Judicial Watch, Dan Bongino, John Solomon, Glenn Beck and others have brought forward, and use it to fix this mess now.

Then, the strategy we published yesterday of bringing about a shutdown and firing as many of these Shadow Government serpents is the inevitable – and only – solution to restoring the American rainbow–and protecting the world from State Department created “spontaneous revolutions”.

The Department of Justice and FBI are too compromised to be of any value in this, as they have, in fact, supported the Shadow Government in the Coup, so Executive action is the only alternative that remains.

Shut down the government at the next budget battle, Mr. President, lay them off, and on Day 30, make those layoffs permanent – including at the FBI and DOJ.

Because medias and education are both controlled by the handful of billionaires that are running the planet, we don’t know anything about our history that’s been twisted dry by the winners, and we don’t have a clue about our present world. As he stepped in the political arena, Donald popularized the expression «fake news» to convince the American citizens, and the world population as well, that medias always lie to you.

Once again, the mainstream media managed to push the news into the pedophilia realm of “Conspiracy Theory” by inventing the term “Fake News” and the social media outlets like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter starting limiting the visibility and discussion of Pizzagate. Even banning people from talking about Pizzagate or Pedophilia on their platform.

How could they do that when the stakes were so high for these children?

Heads should roll when the truth comes out.

Luckily there were honest and brave law enforcement officers that would not cover it up any more and pushed forward with the investigations behind the scenes.

We are starting to see the first results of their investigations as the lower level “facilitators” are starting to be arrested…

This is just the beginning and the arrests will now start to FLOW UP STREAM.

Most likely they will end up on the Ken Lay Island for Elite Criminals that have suspicious heart attacks right before they go to jail!

In one of the shows, Carlton, referring to the days in his mother's womb before birth, states to Will Smith... ""I can't believe I was ever inside a woman."" Will Smith responds by saying... ""We can't either."" The show is saturated with such types of lewd and sexually suggestive comments. In another episode, Will Smith is teaching his younger female cousin, Ashley, to... ""Shake it baby... 'com on, shake it good,"" he states, while listening to worldly music. He then hops off the kitchen counter and begins to gyrate his hips wildly, with his rear-end sticking out, teaching his cousin that this is how she should behave. This is the subtle, sickening, and sinful morality of today's world.

Fresh Prince of Bel Air is deceitful and spiritually confusing to young people, because the show sends a mixed message of morality. On one hand the show teaches moral character lessons about being honest, honoring your parents, and abstaining from drugs; while on the other hand teaching that it's OK to party, drink booze, lust, fornicate, be covetous, dress whorishly, talk dirty, listen to worldly music, have a sexually-perverted mind, and do dirty dancing. Hilary Banks, Will's cousin in the show, wears miniskirts and skin-tight clothing, and acts like a total whore. In one episode, Hilary dresses up sensually in a tight black leather miniskirt, to entice an IRS man. Carlton says she needs to do better, so she lifts her skirt to look more whorish. She states to Carlton... ""I look like an expensive call girl,"" and she certainly does. This is the godless message which Fresh Prince of Bel Air is sending out to young people today. Although the showed aired from 1990 to 1996, it is still extremely popular today.

The important thing is so much to shelter our kids from characters such as Spider Man, Harry Potter, and Will Smith; BUT, rather, to teach our children what is wrong with those characters so that our children won't like them, and know why they shouldn't. My kids don't watch or read Harry Potter, because they don't want to. They know that Harry Potter is all about Satanic witchcraft, because I have shared Scriptures with them, and showed them how actual schools of witchcraft now exist on the internet because of Harry Potter, where kids can enroll for free and learn the craft.

Although Fresh Prince of Bel Air teaches some moral lessons, they also promote lascivious dancing, rap music, wild partying, immodest dress, whoremongering, and fornication. In the series, Will Smith at times brags of the multiple women he's had in his life. Jesus condemned such heathen living (Matthew 5:28). Whoremongering is a sin (Hebrews 13:4). So it's more a matter of teaching our children what's wrong with these characters, rather than just denying them the privilege of watching them. Some parents are dictatorial and simply make rules, without explanation; BUT, it's MUCH better to teach your kids from the Bible why such people as Will Smith are a bad influence. I've taught my children to honor Billy Sunday, D.L. Moody, and many other great men of God, who with their life. My kids respect Congressman Ron Paul, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, and others who are fighting to defend America's freedom. It is the height is ingratitude and wickedness for us to lead our kids to praise and honor Hollywood's godless whores and whoremongers, who pollute the world with their lascivious filth.

I am not trying to be unkind in any way, I am just saying that the world has a twisted sense of morality that continually changes. For example: Homosexuality was widely condemned by society 100 years ago, and treated by psychologists as a mental disease; whereas today it is accepted as an alternative lifestyle, freedom of choice, and psychologists are helping people to accept who they are. When Elvis Presley first appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, they were prohibited from filming anything below his waist, because of the sexually immoral messages being sent by his gyrating hip. Elvis was a sexual pervert, and whoremongering adulterer. Such behavior was offensive to viewers back then, just 50 years ago. Today, people laugh at the thought of banning Elvis' hips from the camera. Today, TV is saturated with nudity, adultery, sexual perversion, whores, and lasciviousness. Why should God bless this sinful nation? God's hand of blessing is slowly being lifted from America, and we will ultimately bring severe judgment upon ourselves. Sin always leads to apathy, and apathy to apostasy. When people stop caring about morality and justice, apostasy sets in like gangrene.

The average person today has a sick sense of morality, which allows for fornication, but condemns adultery... allows for drunkenness, but condemns illegal drugs... allows for pornography, but condemns pedophilia... allows for gambling, but condemns theft... allows for cursing in God's name on the job, but forbids distributing Gospel tracts... and so forth. As Christians, we should look continually to the WORD OF GOD as our moral compass, and NOT the sinful world. The world can't make up it's mind concerning what is right or wrong, because they are saturated with sins themselves. The Word of God is the Final Authority; NOT mankind, and God never changes (Malachi 3:6). Don't be fooled by the subtle innocence of such shows as the Fresh Prince of Bel Air--they're filled with wickedness, which is clearly seen when the Light of God's Word is shone upon them."

The cat is finally out of the bag that childhood vaccines are loaded with toxic chemicals, including the cellular byproducts and derivatives of aborted human babies. But it took a lot of work to get to this point, and the mainstream media is still insistent that this horror is no big deal because vaccines “save lives.”

It was a little over five years ago when ABC News reluctantly admitted that childhood vaccines are, in fact, made using aborted human fetal tissue. But the fake news outlet cited certain religious leaders, including those within the Roman Catholic Church who see nothing wrong with abortion-fueled vaccines, as a manipulation tactic to sway the general public into also supporting the mass genocide of the unborn.

In lamenting the fact that an increasing number of parents object to childhood vaccination, ABC News pointed to a statement made by the National Catholic Bioethics Center that basically contends that getting vaccines made from aborted babies is just fine because not getting vaccinated supposedly harms more lives than those ended through abortion.

“We should always ask our physician whether the product he proposes for our use has an historical association with abortion,” the Center contends, noting, however, that “one is morally free to use the vaccine regardless of its historical association with abortion.”

“The reason is that the risk to public health, if one chooses not to vaccinate, outweighs the legitimate concern about the origins of the vaccine,” the Center went on to state at the time. “This is especially important for parents, who have a moral objection to protect the life and health of their children and those around them.”

Do you really want unborn human fetuses injected into your body?

This position by the Catholic Church is particularly noteworthy now that we have the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to deal with, the reason being that vaccines containing aborted human fetal tissue are once again being pushed by authorities – even though these vaccines do not even yet exist – as the “final solution” to this crisis.

With talk of these Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines possibly being “mandatory,” meaning a government goon might try to arrest and imprison you for resisting, it is once again of critical pertinence that the general public know what these vaccines, like most others, will more than likely contain once they are publicly released.

Besides the usual toxic adjuvants like mercury (thimerosal) and aluminum, Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines will almost certainly contain other added materials derived from aborted human babies, which would probably come as a surprise to millions of Americans who still have no idea how vaccines are made.

Relying on the opinion of some religious leader like the former Pope Benedict XVI, who stated in 2003 that “universal vaccination has resulted in a considerable fall in the incidence of congenital rubella, with a general incidence reduced to less than five cases per 100,000 livebirths, is unacceptable. Americans, and especially religious Americans, must do their due diligence in thinking through this issue on their own to determine the ethical and moral implications of injecting murdered unborn children into their bodies.

After all, it is your body, your choice, as the leftists love to say. Is it not your decision to make, and not the government’s, no matter the perceived threat from some trumped-up pandemic?

“Everyone should have the right to choose according to what they find ethical,” wrote one ABC News commenter at the time. “Some people don’t view the fetus as less than anyone else … If you don’t care, you don’t care. But let those who do have the right to know the truth.”

Let’s start with NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden. He has released information that shows a gigantic government surveillance program that is spying on millions of Americans. It’s not only in the U.S., but this surveillance program is reaching into Asia and Europe according to reports. Many say he’s a hero, some say he’s a traitor. Snowden says he’s just an American, and he says, he’s “here to reveal criminality.” The White House says the intense spying program is fighting terrorists and perfectly legal. It’s also perfectly outrageous, and many think it’s perfectly unconstitutional.

As far as fighting terrorists, how is it we can arm al-Qaeda in places like Syria, and kill al-Qaeda with a drone strike in places like Yemen? Senator John McCain even had his picture taken with known al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria recently. What gives? All this spying must be more than to just thwart terrorists if you are spying on this many Americans. It’s about control.

If you want more evidence of a government seeking control, look no further than the IRS scandal where the Obama administration was using the IRS to stop conservatives and religious groups from organizing opposition. This is an absolute attack on First Amendment rights. It is also more proof of a government wanting to assert control over its people.

Then, there are the stories that are now confirmed in many mainstream sources that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is buying nearly two billion rounds of ammunition and buying thousands of assault rifles. Congress is even putting up legislation to stop DHS from buying any more ammunition. Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma recently said DHS is buying ammunition to dry up supply. The only reason for that is to assert more physical control over the population.

Just this week, Congressman Jeff Duncan from South Carolina revealed he recently toured a DHS facility and found IRS agents training with AR-15s. He didn’t give any further information but stated on his Congressional web page he is going to investigate further. Why would IRS agents be training with assault rifles? Is this how they are planning to collect taxes?

How about the recent investigations into members of the press being secretly spied upon by the government? This is about asserting control over the message and not about protecting the country from terrorists. Please keep in mind, terrorists such as al-Qaeda have been and are being armed by our government!

Former Congressman Ron Paul said, this week, that the reaction to the Boston bombing was really a test run for martial law. He pointed out the massive terror attack that killed 3,000 people did not usher in martial law in New York City in 2001. The terror attack in Boston was horrible and ugly, but only 3 people were killed there, and yet, the entire city of Boston was locked down, and there was a house-to-house search the bombers.

Put all these stories that have been reported in the news and what picture do you see taking shape? What does the government see coming? What are they getting ready for? All the signs appear to show a government that is preparing to take control and stay in control by force, if necessary. Why? That’s what you all should be asking yourselves.

Roger Stone arrested, charged with “process crimes” – NO collusion – while CNN tipped off to capture the theatrics on video

Not only has America become the land of endless fake news, but under the rogue hand of Robert Mueller, this nation is also the land of fake justice. In an early morning raid that was staged exclusively for CNN, Roger Stone was arrested and charged with so-called “process crimes” consisting almost entirely of charges of “lying to Congress.”

Stop the presses. If lying to Congress is a crime, then where is the arrest of Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sunday Pichai who lied under oath and claimed there is no bias in Google search results or Facebook accounts?

If lying to Congress is a crime, where is the arrest of Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Andrew McCabe and Barack Obama himself? And where is the evidence of collusion against Roger Stone, anyway? The deranged, dishonest left-wing media keeps telling us that “Trump colluded with Russia,” but when it comes down to all the staged arrests and criminal charges, there’s no collusion to be found at all. Robert Mueller has become the “King of process crimes” who specializes in trapping people with minor misstatements, then staging pre-dawn armed raids on camera in order to feed fresh meat to the liberal mob media.

“On January 25, 2019, in the pre-dawn hours, at least six FBI vehicles and at least 12 officers stormed Trump associate Roger Stone’s home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,” reports The Gateway Pundit. “The deep state officers were dressed in tactical vests with large weapons. They were wearing night vision glasses. This is the Mueller Deep State at work. They send out fully armed tactical teams to harass and abuse political opponents in the dead of night. And only CNN hacks get tipped off before hand.”

“There are false charges of witness intimidation. This is a politically motivated result,” Roger Stone said in an exclusive interview with Alex Jones of InfoWars.com. “Twenty-nine FBI agents showed up at my home, pounded on my door, I opened my door to pointed automatic weapons. I was handcuffed. There were 17 vehicles in the street with lights on. They terrorized my wife and my dogs. They executed a search warrant. And CNN was present. CNN was tipped off prior to my arrest.”

“I intend to vigorously fight the charges because they are false,” Stone explained.

Robert Mueller is the one who needs to go to jail for rampant abuse of power, witness tampering and obstruction of justice

Robert Mueller is the most corrupt prosecutor in U.S. history, and he has a long history of obstructing justice, abusing power and tampering with witnesses. If anybody should be indicted and charged with crimes against the State, it’s Robert Mueller and his cabal of treasonous actors, including James Comey who illegally leaked classified information to the press in order to get Mueller appointed (while Jeff Sessions looked the other way and abandoned America to save his own skin).

“In an exclusive quote to GP, [Jacob] Engels referred to Mueller’s collusion with CNN to film the arrest as Joseph Goebbels style propaganda,” reports TGP:

“Those claiming for the past two years that we live in the Fourth Reich were right. This is a gestapo state and Robert Mueller is your Fuhrer. To SWAT an older man and his wife at 6AM with CNN cameras rolling is something that would make Joseph Goebbels proud. It was a production of propaganda by the Special Counsel’s office that turned FBI agents into modern day Nazis.

This political hit-squad run by the FBI and their allies in the mainstream media would earn praise from Adolf Hitler. Americans should fight this political persecution with every fiber of their beings, now more than ever.”

“You can now be arrested for having supported Donald Trump for President of the United States. The enemies of freedom have successfully weaponized the FBI into a roaming gestapo-style political persecution hit-squad. They started with Roger Stone, but they will end with us. Infowars, Gateway Pundit, and independent journalists who have stood up to Robert Mueller’s criminal enterprise will not be spared if we don’t stand and fight.”"
714,True,The article presents a conspiracy theory that vaccines are not safe or effective and that the pharmaceutical industry and social media giants are suppressing dissenting information.,True,"The article mentions the pharmaceutical industry, social media giants like Facebook, and mainstream medicine as actors responsible for promoting vaccines and suppressing dissenting voices.",True,The article claims that the pharmaceutical industry and their puppets declare vaccines to be infallible and that social media giants are declaring a war against health freedom and quashing dissenting information.,True,The article suggests that vaccines contribute to the spread of disease and may actually be harmful. It also mentions adverse events associated with flu vaccines.,True,The article connects various pieces of information to support the conspiracy theory that vaccines are not safe or effective and that there is a suppression of dissenting voices.,True,The article suggests that the pharmaceutical industry and social media giants are intentionally suppressing dissenting information and eliminating vaccine skepticism from the internet.,"More proof that vaccines are bad for you: Getting vaccinated makes you MORE likely to infect others

Pro-vaccine propaganda makes it seem as though the purported benefits of inoculation are irrefutable, but research continues to demonstrate that vaccines aren’t nearly as safe or effective as Big Pharma wants you to believe. While the pharmaceutical industry and their puppets declare their precious shots are infallible, studies show that vaccines don’t just fail to produce immunity — they can actually encourage the spread of disease, too. In fact, there are over 600 studies which highlight the many failures of vaccines.

Under current vaccine dogma, any research which indicates vaccine inefficacy or vaccine damage is “fake news.” Medical tyranny is soaring to new heights, with social media giants like Facebook declaring a war against health freedom and quashing the spread of dissenting information. Anyone who breaks away from the “party line” is now subject to censorship, character assassination and public shaming.

It is no wonder that people are now slowly waking up to the truth that conventional opinions on vaccines are based on industry-funded lies, and nothing more.

As a new report recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America reveals, vaccination can substantially increase the spread of disease. As sources explain, the team of researchers found that influenza carriers exhale significant amounts of viral influenza. In fact, simply exhaling is a more “effective” route of spreading influenza than sneezing — so even if you aren’t symptomatic, you are indeed spreading the virus.

100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety. A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.

This fact becomes far more chilling when combined with the researchers other finding: Vaccinated people shed over six times the amount of infectious flu virus than non-vaccinated individuals. The team reported that there was “6.3 (95% CI 1.9–21.5) times more aerosol shedding among cases with vaccination in the current and previous season compared with having no vaccination in those two seasons.”

As sources contend, these findings indicate that flu vaccination may not just be ineffective, but actually harmful in terms of spreading disease. Rather than preventing illness, it appears that flu inoculations contribute to the spread of influenza and may actually contribute to the onset of disease. Indeed, flu-vaccinated people spread 630 percent more viral particulate than their unadulterated peers.

Mike Adams, founder of Natural News and creator of Brighteon.com, contends further:

The flu vaccine has been heavily scrutinized in the past for its lack of efficacy; some years the vaccine was so bad that even the CDC had no choice but to apologize for their massive failure. But beyond the blatant lack of proof that flu vaccines actually work, there is substantial proof that flu vaccines are dangerous. Many studies have shown that vaccination contributes to the spread of disease — and even more alarming, there is always a risk of adverse events.

In late 2018, a flu shot victim was left unable to walk, speak or breathe on his own. And this is what modern medicine levies as its Holy Grail?

Under pro-vaccine dogma, only one opinion is allowed to reign — and that opinion is that vaccines are infallible. There is a veritable mountain of evidence to the contrary, and yet, most of mainstream medicine refuses to even acknowledge the possibility that they are wrong. Proponents of the vaccine industry and their puppets are bent on silencing all dissenting voices and eliminating any traces of vaccine skepticism from the internet, and it’s time to start asking why.

This includes the mainstream media (MSM), which we all realize is nothing more than socialist Democrat New World Order Globalist propaganda. Why the intensified attacks? They are afraid of losing their power, kickback scams and freedom because some of them are going to jail for their crimes and hoaxes to remove a duly elected President from Office. Nothing is working to dump Trump. Trump is now beginning to fight back on all sorts of levels including mass firings of Obama holdovers at the White House.

Dems are desperate after the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. They don’t have a leading candidate that can beat President Donald Trump. They are also afraid of Bernie Sanders because he threatens the crooked establishment. If they screw him out of the Democrat nomination again, look for a huge split in the party which is to Trump’s advantage.

The Wuhan Coronavirus is bringing China to its knees in terms of business activity. The economy and its exports are in the process of grinding to a halt. How is that going to play globally? Are debts going to be defaulted on? Can the Fed continue to save the day? Is China’s brutal communist regime finally going to be exposed for what it really is?

With the most recent Google “Core” update, which took place in June, substantial changes were made to the search results that users pull up when querying topics like vaccine safety, genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), cancer, pharmaceuticals, and climate change – with Google, as you probably well know, now actively censoring independent viewpoints that run contrary to the controlled narrative on these and other controversial issues.

Quite obviously veering from its “don’t be evil” motto of old, Google has decided to now be only evil by willfully manipulating the information that the world is allowed to access through its platform. Rather than encourage free thought and open debate, in other words, Google wants you and everyone else to simply accept what the government and media claim is true about medicine, food, and weather patterns.

While it was once the case that Google fomented an internet culture of freedom and honest expression, its new fascist policies aim to ensure that everyone thinks exactly the same as everyone else about concepts like “herd immunity” and “science-based medicine.” There’s simply no room for independent thought when it comes to such topics, at least according to Google’s new “thought police,” which are working overtime to make sure that internet users are only able to access pre-approved propaganda.

What this has led to is the systematic removal of websites, pages, and channels that take what you might call an “alternative” approach to accessing and processing news and other information. Natural News, for instance, was recently de-platformed not only by Google, but also by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, the latter of which is owned by Google.

“Websites [that] promote or provide a platform for critical perspectives of vaccine safety, questioning the lack of safety studies or vaccine efficacy, found that Google has unilaterally removed the search traffic they once enjoyed, without engaging in any debate or providing any notice, or any explanation!” explains GreenMedInfo.

Rather than censor politically incorrect information, why doesn’t Google fund the science necessary to end the vaccine debate once and for all?

Google has been trying extra hard to whitewash this digital “book-burning” by claiming that it’s necessary to “save lives” and prevent users from accessing “misinformation” that might harm them. With vaccines, as perhaps the most prominent example, Google doesn’t want anyone to question either their safety nor effectiveness, because any honest inquiry outside of Big Pharma’s own “studies” and claims allegedly puts public health at risk.

“Are mottos like ‘don’t be evil’ or ‘make the world better’ compatible with unilaterally and secretly deciding what specific information is made available to the public by removing honest disagreements and controversial sources of information (claimed to be misinformation), while quietly choosing which narrative will prevail?” asks GreenMedInfo about how Google is somehow trying to justify this tyranny.

This would seem to be the first time in Google’s history that the company has taken a side with regards to information, as opposed to simply providing the information that people want, no questions asked. Since the multinational corporation has clearly changed course, and is now acting as a content publisher rather than a content provider, it’s more than time for this Silicon Valley conglomerate to be held accountable for breaking antitrust laws, among other crimes.

“Because it has not been proven scientifically that there are no extra risks (with vaccines), the only way to settle this debate is to do the science, not [compel] large tech companies to do the bidding of the vaccine companies,” GreenMedInfo contends.

“This cannot bode well for their reputation which is already on shaky ground, especially if in the future, scientific studies end up proving the risks are higher than currently accepted.”

We shall take every measure possible to close the Strait of Hormuz. If the US aims – by sending jets, carriers – to reinforce its positions and status among the international community, it doesn’t concern us. But if the US is seriously aiming to threaten us, it should know that not one drop of oil will leave the region and we shall destroy all US interests in the Middle East”. This is what the President Grand Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei said in 1983, in response to the US President Ronald Regan’s decision to send jet carriers to the Middle East during the Iran-Iraq war. It seems like only yesterday.

Today, in 2019, the experienced and veteran leader of the revolution, Sayyed Khamenei – who played a role in the very similar critical situation in the 80s – is facing President Donald Trump and an administration who seem not to have learned much from history and the previous US-Iran confrontation. Looking at past foreign policy with a critical eye seems not to be part of the current US administration’s practice. A small reminder may give many answers to what Trump can expect in a wider confrontation with Iran.

In the 80s, Iran’s “Islamic Revolution” was facing serious problems on many levels. Its armed forces were disorganised and dispersed; there were serious differences between decision-makers and politicians over how to run the country following the fall of the Shah; domestic security was lacking; there were ethnic and national struggles; no country was ready to sell weapons to Iran; the US, Europe and the Gulf states supported Saddam Hussein’s aggression against Iran; and the country was going through serious economic difficulties.

It was a perfect scenario for Saddam Hussein to invade Iran, which he did in September 1980 by bombing Mehrabad international airport and occupied later Khorramshahr, calling for an uprising of ethnic Arabs “in al-Muhammara”. This same objective, and concomitant regime-change is what the US administration has been aiming at since 1979- and it apparently retains the same fixation in 2019.

Many may not remember that Imam Khomeini did not hesitate to encourage the Iranian leadership, led by the current Rahbar (Spiritual Leader) Sayyed Ali Khamenei (1987), who was the President of Iran then, to confront and open fire against US forces or indeed any hostile country sailing in the Gulf. “If I were you (addressing his speech to the political leadership), I would order the armed forces to target the first vessel protecting an oil carrier trying to cross the Strait of Hormuz. You decide what you think best (as a course of action), whatever it takes”, said Imam Khomeini.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (and Sheikh Hashemi Rafsanjani) gave immediate orders to the armed forces to act accordingly. All armed forces were fully coordinated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Forces (IRGC – Pasdaran). Iran launched Chinese-made Silkworm missiles on Kuwait port al-Ahmadi. Another attack was registered on a Kuwaiti oil tanker that had been registered to fly the American flag and was sailing under US Navy protection- it hit an Iranian mine in the Gulf. Moreover, Iran shot down a US helicopter using US-made Stinger missiles delivered by the Afghan Mujahedeen to Iran. It was ready to take the confrontation further in the Persian Gulf, careless of the US “almighty” military power. Iran also attacked a Soviet vessel, the freighter Ivan Korotoyev, sailing in the Gulf and providing naval escorts for its ships.

It was rare to see the two superpowers, the US and Russia, united against Iran in one Middle Eastern conflict, in support of Saddam Hussein. Of course, Iran’s diplomacy skills were not yet sharpened. It was helping the Afghans against the Soviets and was committed to fighting US hegemony in the Middle East.

Sayyed Ali Khamenei went to New York, and at the UN Security Council told the worldthat “the US will receive a response to its hideous action” in the Gulf (following a US attack against an Iranian commercial ship called Iran Ajr). Indeed, a US owned giant oil tanker carrying the name of Sungari was attacked and set ablaze by the IRGC. Iran was not willing to stand down, but instead showed itself ready to confront two superpower countries at a time when Tehran was in its worst condition.

Today, Iran is well equipped with all kinds of missiles, and is a more powerful, highly productive country with strong and efficient allies who can hurt its enemies much more than in 1987. The Islamic Revolution principles and values are still the same, led by more or less the same people. The IRGC is stronger than ever and is an integrated part of the armed forces.

Sayyed Ali Khamenei was fully devoted to Imam Khomeini. He served as a faithful guardian of the “Islamic Revolution”, supervised the IRGC, represented Imam Khomeini at the Security Council and played an effective role in arming and merging the IRGC into all levels of the country’s armed forces. He will not hesitate to take further steps against any weakness any leader in the country today might show in trying to soften the relationship with the US. Today, the leader of the Revolution is neither afraid of war, nor of peace. He will not negotiate with Trump and will not help him be re-elected in 2020. Those who think Iran is desperate or cornered or failing due to the US sanctions may need to read more carefully the history and behaviour of the “Islamic Revolution” since 1979."
719,True,The article discusses a group of conservative Christians who believe that the September 11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax terror are signs of the biblical apocalypse.,True,The article mentions conservative Christians who believe in the biblical apocalypse.,False,There is no mention of any specific actions taken by the actors.,True,The article mentions the belief in a time of tribulations and the fear that is stoking religious fervor.,False,There is no mention of any patterns or connections made by the actors.,False,There is no mention of any secrecy or attempts to mislead.,"(AFP) - For some conservative Christians in the United States, the September 11 attacks and the subsequent anthrax terror can only mean one thing: the biblical apocalypse is now.

 

 For these believers who trace their fundamentalist Christian traditions back to the evangelical movement's roots in US history, the signposts to doomsday are crystal clear in the Bible.

 

 They draw inspiration from the Book of Revelation, the biblical window onto the end of the world attributed by some scholars to the apostle John.

 

 For these mainly Protestant groups, Revelation explains the true significance to the flames and death visited on New York on September 11.

 

 Chapter 18 speaks to them of New York, when it says: ""Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.""

 

 Even more so when it says that the world's rulers will ""see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry.""

 

 For Ernesto McKenzie, a Pentacostal Church pastor in Washington the words ring true.

 

 ""It's like reading something from the headlines of our time,"" said McKenzie, whose Pentacostalist Church boast a following of 10 million.

 

 ""It seems to be that we are at the interlude of a dreadful time,"" he said. ""All those dreadful things that the Bible is talking about in Revelation and Apocalypse, time of tribulations such as there has not been before, neither will there be after.""

 

 The bioterrorism scare in the United States in the form of anthrax letters could be the start of those so-called tribulations, which could last seven years, scholars of scripute say.

 

 Following the airborne terrorist strikes on New York and Washington that left more that 5,000 people dead, Americans have been seeking solace in religion in increasing numbers.

 

 Books dealing with the apocalpyse are flying off shelves at stores and Bible sales are at record levels.

 

 ""That trend started the weekend following the attacks (of September 11) and has continued over the past six weeks or so,"" said Tara Powers, spokeswoman for ""Family Christian Stores"" which owns 350 book shops in the United States. There is ""no sign of it dying down right now,"" she added.

 

 Across the country, some clerics and church leaders are chiming in on new religious fervor and the fear that is stoking it.

 

 In a message for all believers, Bishop Gilbert Earl Patterson of the Church of God in Christ, which boats a following of 5.5 million people, spoke of the second coming of Christ.

 

 ""What we have seen today could very well be the beginning of the countdown that will lead to the final world conflict which will usher in the return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,"" said the bishop based in Memphis, Tennessee.

 

 Other religious figures are keeping cooler heads. Hank Hanegraaff, president of California's Christian Research Institute, dismissed the doomsday scenario as so much 'newspaper theology' in comments to The Washington Times."

Friday, the tech heavy NASDAQ suffered a massive selloff late in the day after hitting all-time highs. What happened? Mannarino explains, “There is no doubt that we are in financial fantasyland. It is epic. So, have we just witnessed the bursting of this bubble? It is very possible, and the reason why is because it came out of nowhere. It wasn’t driven by a geopolitical event. It wasn’t driven by a downgrade. It wasn’t driven by anything, it just happened. . . . There is going to be a moment of reckoning. If this is real. If this is an actual bursting of a bubble here, the tech bubble, we might get a follow through on Monday or we might get a bounce, and that will lead to a follow through. . . . I am telling people to watch out because the fact this came out of nowhere and driven by nothing is a big tell.”

Even if this is not a sign of a meltdown, one is baked in no matter what, according to Mannarino. Mannarino contends, “Nothing is real here . . . . You watch these financial commentators talk about this market like it is real. If it were real, the Federal Reserve would not be taking the largest part of this market for the better part of a decade now. They are artificially suppressing interest rates and creating bubbles like we have never seen. These are the worst distortions that have ever been seen in the history of the financial world. That’s a fact. It’s worse than the Dotcom bubble and way worse than the 2008 meltdown. This one has the potential to make the last two look like walking through Central Park with an ice cream cone. Are they going to use this against President Trump? They are going to twist this, and we need to be ready for anything.”

The so-called Deep State has been trying to take President Trump down, and nothing has worked. If the Deep State cannot take Trump down, what are they going to do? Mannarino says, “They are going to collapse the economy. They are going to wipe out the economy, and they are going to hurt everybody. Housing is in a bubble and it’s cracking. . . . The markets are in bubbles that are truly epic. This is all being supported on the back of a debt bubble. That’s what they are going to do. No doubt about it. If they can’t get Trump any other way, they are going to collapse the economy. . . . We are going to see a wave of wealth go from one group of people to another group of people. This is the setup that has been going on for a long time. . . . There are those on the inside that are determined to bring down this country. If this thing comes apart, we have the potential for civil war right here in the United States.”

There’s a saying, be careful what you wish for, you just might get it. New York City is a place where thousands of babies are murdered every year in their mother’s womb, and the politicians threw a party after passing laws allowing due date abortions in 2019. In 2015, the Empire State Building was lit up in spectacular fashion with the image of Kali, the Hindu goddess of death. It was almost as if they were inviting her in. In 2020, that same Empire State Building is now flashing a red distress signal. Why? Because death has come to their streets, and the people are terrified.

“I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days:” Deuteronomy 30:19,20 (KJB)

Let’s learn a little about who Kali, the Hindu goddess of death is:

New York has become an epicenter for COVID-19 in the United States, with over 38,000 confirmed cases and 900 deaths as of Tuesday morning, according to Johns Hopkins.

The Empire State Building is commemorating doctors, nurses and other medical employees working at the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic by showing a flashing red light, like an ambulance siren. The spectacle, which was met with both alarm and gratitude on social media, is intended to resemble a “heartbeat,” according to a statement from the building’s owners.

This is what the Empire State Building looked like in 2015:

The Times of India was thrilled when Kali was projected on the side of perhaps the most famous building in the world, and called it a ‘breathtaking spectacle’. Artist Andrew Jones designed the portrait of the goddess to make the point that ‘Mother Nature now more than ever needs a fierce avatar to fight the dangers of pollution and extinction’. Wow.

This Is The Empire State Building in 2020:

My heart breaks for the dead and dying in New York City right now, it truly does. But let me ask you this. Do you really think it’s a coincidence that after making such a grand ‘spectacle’ of honoring the Hindu ‘goddess of death’ Kali that now the streets of New York are awash with so many dead bodies the morgues can’t hold them all? Please pray for the people of New York City, that God would show them mercy. And pray their eyes will be opened, that like Nineveh they would repent and turn from the culture of death they’ve created and choose life.

In 2019, the Empire State Building was lit to celebrate the death of unborn babies

Just one generation ago, the world was horrified when newsreels from the Allied Forces liberating Germany shocked the world with raw moving images of Hitler’s concentration camps. People watched with jaws scraping the floor as they saw in utter disbelief the mass killing of human beings in gas chambers, ovens, and being shot in large groups. Contrast that with yesterday as New York governor Andrew Cuomo celebrated the legal mass killings of babies up to the moment of birth by lighting up New York City in pink. Let the irony of choosing the color pink, the color that represents a newborn baby girl, sink in for a moment.

News for the Biden family has gone from bad to very bad as far as Ukraine goes. The owner of the energy company that Joe Biden’s son (Hunter) was working with in Ukraine was just indicted on a multi-billion dollar money laundering operation. Hunter Biden’s company allegedly received $16.5 million in what prosecutors claim was “gotten through criminal means and money laundering.” You wonder why the Dems are fighting so hard to get rid of President Trump.

Channels that mention CBD oil (cannabidiol) in any of their videos will be banned under the new policies because, according to YouTube, it ""poses a risk of serious physical harm or death.""

The Google-owned internet giant has been accused of jumping in bed with Big Pharma and the corrupt cancer industry, for enforcing this suspicious new policy.

YouTube has now begun banning entire video channels that post videos describing the compassionate use of CBD oil for cancer patients over ""approved"" expensive long-term drugs and treatments.

Google is now branding this natural oil, with no known side effects, that helps to ease the pain and suffering of thousands of people, as ""dangerous.""

Mike Adams, otherwise called The Health Ranger on YouTube has now been permanently prohibited from using the site under this new ruling.

The Natural News channel is for a second time, gone.

According to Adams, YouTube claimed a 43-second video he posted about the compassionate healing potential of CBD oil was subjecting viewers to ""risk of severe physical harm or death.""

Instead of allowing the issuance of three strikes before banning a channel, YouTube completely prohibited our channel with a single strike (see screenshots below).

YouTube now thinks about videos that talk about natural medicine and saving lives from cancer to be ""hazardous"" and ""unsafe.""

That's what YouTube has now become: an enemy of natural medicine and healing.

This is the very same YouTube that honestly enables children of all ages to see a violent depiction of a deadly massacre due to the fact that its part of a hate-based music video from ""Childish Gambino"" called This is America.

Meanwhile, Paul Joseph Watson's video that brilliantly exposes the narrative of violence and hate that infuses the video has been shadowbanned by YouTube to make sure no one sees it.

That's right: The video illustrating mass murder in a black church is not banned, but a video criticizing that video gets successfully banned.

The censorship is only getting worse, and it's impacting those who vital of the main story, whether it be on violence, gun ownership, mass shootings, or Western medicine.

Ideally, we can all stand together soon and speak against all censorship of any kind for any reason.

Free speech isn't just a constitutional right, it's an essential human right.

YouTube says KILLING a black church choir with an AK-47 is perfectly all right, however SAVING lives with marijuana is dangerous for society...

So let's break this down:

If you have a video where you murder a black church choir with an AK-47 and shoot people in the head, that's alright for children, in accordance with YouTube policies, because it promotes a race-baiting HATE story to push prior to the mid-term elections. If you have a video talking about natural medicine that treats cancer, ends human suffering and conserves lives, that's a kind of ""violence"" according to YouTube because it presents a ""threat of serious physical harm or death."" (But note, carefully, that showing a mass shooting of a black church choir somehow does NOT qualify as violence in accordance with YouTube) If you publish a video talking about racial healing and unity, calling for all mankind to live together in peace and harmony, that gets your entire channel banned due to the fact that YouTube, run by ridiculous Leftists, doesn't want racial unity. They wish to maximize hatred before the mid-term elections as yet another desperate tactic to attempt to get Democrats elected who will impeach President Trump."

High says Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President and explains, “I don’t have any data that says, hard stop, Trump is assassinated. I don’t have that . . . . I am willing to back my data with real money, an ounce of silver, and I have an ounce of silver, and I would be willing to bet the inauguration part goes through smoothly given the emotional data sets we have now.”

High, who calls what he does “Predictive Linguistics,” mines the internet and collects billions of data points to produce forecasts of the future. On the financial markets, High simply says, “We’re screwed. . . . The equity markets in our data sets are highly manipulated. So, if you ask will there be a crash? I say there already is a crash. Everybody that is not part of the financial system at the top end is currently living in a depression, and the media does not acknowledge this.”

On the U.S. dollar and its purchasing power, High predicts, “The purchasing power is going to be eroded away fairly quickly. I suspect the erosion (of the U.S. dollar) is going to start in March or so. . . . The turning point for the Trump euphoria will hit at the end of February and carry on through March and April. There will probably be people that will define this as a crash. . . . In our data sets, around March and April, the erosion of the dollar continues . . . The Fed, in a laggardly way, starts to chase interest rates. . . . We may jump to 9% or 10% interest rates as quickly as March or April.”

On Real Estate prices, High’s data tells him the entire market will eventually “fall by 90%.” High explains, “The language is about the high end crashing first, and then, it meets the middle tier, and then they crash to meet the lower tier. So, it’s not going to be the high end coming down and then stabilizing. We are seeing a generalized property price crash that is really just going to coincide with the inability of the banks to circulate enough money and create enough debt to blow the balloon up again. Real estate will drop for what I am calling a credit freeze for lack of a better word.”

On Gold and Silver and Bitcoin, High says they will start moving up at the beginning of the New Year, and Obama will see the beginnings of a market crash before he leaves office. High contends, “Our data sets show that there is a lot of upward pressure on Gold and Silver and Bitcoin as the currencies go into a crisis mode. That basically is already happening.”

High’s data is pointing to Silver and Gold prices starting to takeoff in early 2017. High says data is showing a possible “$600 per ounce price for Silver” at some point. High says before that happens, he sees “$125 per ounce” price for Silver on up to “$345 per ounce.” High’s data also repeatedly says the “gold price per ounce will eventually be equal to the Dow.”

High also predicts, “There are going to be so many of these flash crashes they are going to be called ‘flashies.’ We are going to have these flashies as a repeated component of our technological age here for at least the next few months. We are going to have these especially as we move into January.”

High’s latest report is titled Sci-fi World and has data about Antarctica and new technology discoveries from the continent at the bottom of the world. High says, “We called this Sci-Fi world because we are going to be getting into things . . . like re-looking at our history that will go back 7,000 years. That’s going to upset a lot of people whose thinking is so ridged that they are not going to be able to accept the developing reality around them. A lot of this is going to come from this discovery that has already occurred in Antarctica. It probably occurred 20 years ago, and we are just now going to start hearing about it over these next few years. . . .We are going to start seeing the real information of where trillions of our missing dollars have gone. We are going to start seeing new inventions pouring out all over the place as they have been officially allowed to because we need them now.

Got it? Now let’s see what the Muslim Brotherhood is up to…

Egypt’s banned Muslim Brotherhood movement has unveiled its plans to scrap a peace treaty with Israel if it comes to power, a deputy leader said in an interview with NHK TV. Rashad al-Bayoumi said the peace treaty with Israel will be abolished after a provisional government is formed by the movement and other Egypt’s opposition parties. “After President Mubarak steps down and a provisional government is formed, there is a need to dissolve the peace treaty with Israel,” al-Bayoumi said. Egypt was the first Arab country to officially recognize Israel and sign a peace agreement with the Israeli government in 1979. It is also a major mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Muslim Brotherhood has recently come to light amid mass anti-government protests in Egypt. Some media voiced concerns that the banned Islamic movement could eventually take power in the riot-hit Arab country. The deeply conservative Islamic movement, which wants to move Egypt from secularism and return to the rules of the Quran, failed to win a single seat in the 2010 Egyptian parliamentary election. The Muslim Brotherhood joined the anti-government protests in Egypt last week. The unrest, seen by many analysts as a major threat to repressive governments in the region, has already claimed the lives of at least 300 people and injured several thousand. source – RIA Novosti

Assad responds to Western claims that he has been attacking his own people

Syrian President Bashar Assad has slammed the US, the UK, and France for supporting terrorists in Syria, adding they are responsible for all the bloodshed in the country.

Assad statement was in response to Western claims that he has been attacking his own people.

He then concluded that the war against the terrorists has been underway for years as he has been in charge of the country because “this president… has the support of his own people.

How could he have the support, while he’s killing the same people?”

Yesterday Neon Nettle reported that US Special Forces has been exposed for helping Syrian rebels plot a false flag attack to trigger strikes from the West in Syria.

Russia's Defense Ministry says it has ""credible intelligence"" that proves the United States is helping the Free Syria Army (FSA) to orchestrate a ""chemical attack provocation"" against Syrian civilians.

RT reports: The terrorists, whom the Syrian military is fighting with the help of its allies, are “supported by the British government, the French government and the American [government] and their puppets whether in Europe or in our region.”

During the conflict, the West backed the so-called “moderate opposition” units in Syria, that, on many occasions, were almost impossible to distinguish from the jihadist groups.

It was used by Islamic State and Al-Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra to get possession of an abundance of US and British-made arms, which they used against the government and population.

On several occasions, the US-led coalition carried out strikes against Syrian government forces, which were claimed to have been carried out by mistake, but they were swiftly exploited by the terrorists.

Both Damascus and Moscow have been accusing the West of working in coordination with the terrorists in pursuit of their announced task of removing Assad from power.

“It’s not the role of the West to tell us, who’s responsible in Syria. He interfered in a sovereign country and is responsible for the killing in our country regardless of his narrative and his lies,” the Syrian leader said. “The West supported the war from the very beginning and he supported the terrorists, who started exploding everywhere and killing everyone and beheading [people]. The West supported Al-Qaeda.”

Assad was also questioned about Moscow’s important role in the Syrian conflict, with the British paper’s reporter asking: “Does Russia now make your decisions?”

“Russia is fighting for the international law and part of this international law [is] the sovereignty of different countries… Syria is one of them. Their values aren’t about interference or dictate… We’ve had good relations with Russia for nearly seven decades now. They never, during our relations, tried to dictate, even if there are differences,” he replied.

“The only decision about what’s going on in Syria and what’s going to happen – it’s the Syrian decision,” the president concluded.

The Russian Air Force was first dispatched to Syria back in September 2015 on the official request of Damascus.

The successful bombing campaign against the terrorists has helped reverse the military situation on the ground and paved the way for the advances of government forces, while the establishment of de-escalation zone has led to most of the Syrian territory currently being liberated.

In one of his rare interviews with the Western media, Assad recalled his stay in London where he took postgraduate training in ophthalmology in the early 1990s.

“It’s impossible for you to live in a city and don’t feel the special link with that city,” he said of the British capital, and stressed the sad irony of the current situation when “the same city that you like is in the same country that’s’ been attacking your country.”"

An op-ed in The Daily Caller by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska claims the narrative of Moscow meddling in the 2016 election is a “false public manipulation,” and that Daniel Jones — a former FBI investigator and staffer for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. and presently a Fusion GPS operative — told him in March 2017 the D.C. firm was funded by “a group of Silicon Valley billionaires and George Soros.”

What’s particularly noteworthy is that Deripaska’s lawyer, Adam Waldman — a Washington lawyer — recommended that Jones investigate and verify claims made in the dossier, which was assembled by former British spy Christopher Steel.

In addition, Waldman served as an intermediary between Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Steele in an attempt to arrange a meeting, which “suggests that Waldman, Jones, Steele, and Fusion GPS are all connected,” Zero Hedge noted.

In his Daily Caller piece, Deripaska describes the never-ending “Russia narrative” as little more than a manufactured scandal offered up by the Deep State, or “Wagging the money,” he writes.

“So, who is the ‘funding mechanism’ of this ‘shadowy government?’” None other than another billionaire (and seasoned Left-wing political meddler) George Soros, according to Jones — as told to congressional investigators by Deripaska attorney Waldman:

[O]n March 16, 2017, Daniel Jones — himself a team member of Fusion GPS, self-described former FBI agent and, as we now know from the media, an ex-Feinstein staffer — met with my lawyer, Adam Waldman, and described Fusion as a “shadow media organization helping the government,” funded by a “group of Silicon Valley billionaires and George Soros.” My lawyer testified these facts to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Nov. 3. Mr. Soros is, not coincidentally, also the funder of two “ethics watchdog” NGOs (Democracy 21 and CREW) attacking Rep. Nunes’ committee memo.

Jones currently operates Penn Quarter Group, which is a “research and investigatory advisory” firm whose website was first registered in April 2016 — just days before Steele delivered the first in a series of Trump-Russia memos (none of which have been substantiated). In 2017 Jones began tweeting out a series of articles suggestion “collusion” between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last month, The Federalist’s Sean Davis reported that congressional documents and leaked texts between Warner and Waldman reveal Jones is “intimately involved with ongoing efforts to retroactively validate” the Trump dossier.

Congressional documents and recently leaked texts between Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and a registered foreign agent for a Russian aluminum oligarch indicate that Daniel J. Jones is intimately involved with ongoing efforts to retroactively validate a series of salacious and unverified memos produced by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, and Fusion GPS.

And of course, the Soros angle wouldn’t be complete without a connection to Hillary Clinton and the American Communist Party, otherwise known as the Democrats: The DNC and the Clinton campaign paid Fusion to create the dossier.

Jones comes up in leaked text messages between Warner and Waldman as a point of contact for Steele. The messages, which were leaked to Fox News, discuss efforts by Warner to secure Steele’s testimony.

For his part, Deripaska, who was Russia’s wealthiest man before the 2008 financial crisis, has been scrutinized in recent weeks for his association with short-lived Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

But he goes on to confirm what working journalists have long known existed: There is a “deep state.”

“What has been inelegantly termed the ‘Deep State’ is really this: shadow power exercised by a small number of individuals from media, business, government and the intelligence community, foisting provocative and cynically false manipulations on the public. Out of these manipulations, an agenda of these architects’ own design is born,” he writes.

And it is still trying to do a number on President Donald J. Trump.

The American Left has been increasingly comfortable in the Democrat Party now for decades, becoming more so after Barack Obama the Marxist took it over when he was elected in 2008.

And with increasing Leftism comes increasing authoritarianism — because all of today’s modern Left-wing political ideologies use violence, intimidation, and authoritarianism in order to steal power and keep it.

With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that a Left-wing nut job law school professor at Cornell University would recommend that Democrats in Congress toss out the Constitution and centuries of governing precedence to actually arrest and jail associates of President Donald Trump.

As Breitbart News reported, Prof. Josh Chafetz wrote in The New York Times (where else?) that in order to advance Democrats’ impeachment push (which is based on no evidence, no crimes, and no wrongdoing — just a hyper-politicized and lying media) — Trump officials ought to not simply be questioned but arrested and, yes, jailed.

Chafetz’s bizarre column came after White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) which said the administration will not cooperate with Democrats’ so-called impeachment probe because it is “illigitimate,” “unconstitutional,” and nothing more than an attempt to “overturn the results” of the 2016 president election.

Indeed, Cipollone is correct. Thus far, Pelosi has only announced that an impeachment inquiry ‘has begun.’ But that’s a lie, technically speaking: The House Judiciary Committee has not yet voted out a resolution to begin a formal impeachment inquiry, and a majority of the House has not concurred. There have been no votes so there can’t be a legitimate impeachment probe.

But Mr. Law Professor Chafetz sees it differently. If Trump officials and members of POTUS’ administration won’t comply with a bogus inquiry, then he says House Democrats should go full tyrant and order the House Sergeant-at-Arms to go arrest them and place them in a “makeshift” jail on Capitol Hill. (Related: Rep. Gohmert: “Somebody HAS to go to jail” over FISA abuse targeting Trump campaign.)

“The House should instead put back on the table the option of using its sergeant-at-arms to arrest contemnors — as the person in violation of the order is called — especially when an individual, like Rudy Giuliani, is not an executive branch official,” Chafetz writes. “Neither house of Congress has arrested anyone since 1935, but it was not uncommon before that point (and was blessed by the Supreme Court in 1927).”

Giuliani may not be an official of the Executive Branch — but he’s Trump’s personal lawyer. So this idiot is advocating that the president’s legal counsel be jailed for protecting his client.

Facilities in the Capitol or one of the House office buildings can be made into a makeshift holding cell if necessary. Of course, arrestees will ask the courts to set them free, but the case should be relatively open-and-shut against them: They will have committed a contempt in refusing to turn over subpoenaed materials, and the House has the power to hold contemnors.

Talk about a strategy that Hitler, Mao, and Stalin would love.

Two things: First of all, employing legal tools against serving members of government cuts both ways. For example, members of Congress are generally exempt from most legal actions while Congress is in session, but not all legal actions. The Supreme Court has concluded that sitting lawmakers (yes, even Democrats) can be held liable for “Treason, Felony, and Breach of the Peace,” as well as be made to testify in criminal and civil actions.

And while there is historical precedent for Congress to ‘jail’ people, that’s not what happens these days, as Time notes:

The full House or Senate can approve a contempt citation by a majority vote, and then must hand the matter to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, “whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action,” according to the law.

President Trump is head of the Executive Branch. The Justice Department falls under the Executive Branch. Constitutionally, there isn’t a legitimate federal court that would require the Executive Branch to investigate and punish itself.

Oh, and by the way, a federal court wouldn’t uphold a congressional contempt charge against Democratic AG Eric Holder in 2014."

The UK Department of Health was forced to reveal confidential documents outlining the details of MMR’s initial approval in the 1980s, following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The FOIA request was filed in response to the growing number of children afflicted with debilitating gut problems, brain problems and other symptoms believed to be associated with MMR, following their vaccination.

As it turns out, the fears regarding the adverse effects of vaccines are not completely unfounded. The uncovered documents reveal that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), the manufacturer of the MMR vaccine Pluserix, knew that the vaccines could cause serious complications in children, some of which are encephalitis and other conditions associated with autism.

“We have compensated cases in which children exhibited an encephalopathy, or general brain disease,” admitted Tina Cheatham, Senior Advisor to the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior, autism, or seizures.”

CDC, Pediatrics, US government and Merck all admit MMR vaccine causes autism

This admission has huge repercussions, since encephalopathy following vaccination has been known to produce autism symptoms. GSK, the British government and various other players all kept this information secret, even after brave whistleblowers, such as Dr. William Thompson, came forward publicly with data linking the MMR vaccine to autism-related health outcomes.

While health authorities have previously made allusions to the link between MMR and autism, none has, so far, made a direct to the point statement about it.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, has admitted that rubella, the German measles component of MMR, has been known to be a cause of autism since the 1960s. Even Merck & Co., a major manufacturer of MMR vaccines, has made admissions to the effect that vaccines in general can cause autism.

“[R]ubella (congenital rubella syndrome) is one of the few proven causes of autism,” stated Walter A. Orenstein, M.D., former Assistant Surgeon General and Director of the National Immunization Program, in a 2002 letter to the UK’s Chief Medical Officer.

“[R]ubella virus is one of the few known causes of autism,” explained the CDC on its “FAQs (frequently asked questions) about MMR Vaccine & Autism” page, which has since been removed from public view. It is still available in some web archives.

Dr. Julie Gerberding, M.D., M.P.H., the current president of Merck’s Vaccines Division, has also previously admitted that people with a predisposition to mitochondrial dysfunction can develop autism following vaccination. A minimum of 20 percent of vaccine-induced autism cases are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

“Now, we all know that vaccines can occasionally cause fevers in kids,” stated Dr. Gerberding back in 2008 during a segment on House Call with Dr. Sanjay Gupta titled “Unraveling the Mystery of Autism.”

“So if a child was immunized, got a fever, had other complications from the vaccines. And if you’re predisposed with the mitochondrial disorder, it can certainly set off some damage. Some of the symptoms can be symptoms that have characteristics of autism.”"

Democrat presidential candidates, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg, blasted President Donald Trump during an ABC News’ Democrat debate for killing Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimani last month.

“While there is still debate on whether there was an imminent threat, there is no debate on whether Soleimani was a bad actor who was responsible for the deaths of many Americans,” ABC News said.

“Given what you know about Soleimani, if your national security team came to you with an opportunity to strike, would Soleimani have been dead, or would he still be alive under your presidency?”

Buttigieg was the first to argue that the president's decision had not made the country safer.

“In the situation that we saw with President Trump’s decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer,” Buttigieg said.

“Look, uh, I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated,"" he added.

""It’s also the case that if we have learned nothing else from the war in Iraq, it’s that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you are doing.”

Sanders agreed, adding that Trump was opening the door to international anarchy.

“You cannot go around saying, ‘You’re a bad guy, we’re going to assassinate you,’ and then you’re going have, if that happens, you’re opening the door to international anarchy that every government in the world will then be subjected to attacks and assassination.”

Biden also weighed in saying, ""the reason I wouldn’t have ordered the strike, there’s no evidence yet of an imminent threat that was going to come from him.”

In January, Biden advised Trump to take advice from his national security advisers when responding to escalating tensions with Iran.

The former Vice president called Trump ""dangerously incompetent"" while claiming he is on the brink taking the U.S. into another war in the Middle East.

Last month, Elizabeth Warren alleged that Trump killed Soleimani so he could divert attention away from the upcoming impeachment trial.

""We know he’s deeply upset about that, and I think people are reasonably asking why this moment,” Warren added.

The Pentagon said at the time that Soleimani was “actively developing plans” to attack American service members and diplomats in Iraq.

“At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization,"" The White House said in a statement at the time.

Mannarino says, “On a weekly basis, yet another fund manager is coming out to speak against stock market evaluations and against what the Federal Reserve is doing. Stanley Drukenmiller, a multi-billionaire hedge fund manager, came out on CNBC, and they didn’t turn him off. He said the Federal Reserve is the Darth Vader of the financial markets and has inflated asset bubbles all over the place. They let him talk. They didn’t cut him off.”

Mannarino goes on to say, “The Fed has created bubbles. This is no secret, and the market is twisted, it is distorted. There is no real true price discovery mechanism, and there will not be until these world central banks stop managing the markets. They have created fakery and made it way worse than the top of the last bubble. This does not mean that this stock market is not going to go higher.”

They are going to play it using the futures market. Wall Street is going to game this. How do we know this? Wall Street games everything.”

On the Bond market, Mannarino contends, “The debt market or the bond market is in the largest bubble the world has ever seen.

It has lost almost all of its purchasing power.”

Mannarino explains, “When we see a sell-off in the bond market that does not stop, and we see a simultaneous sell-off in the stock market, when these two assets start to sell off at the same time, there is the gong of gongs. . . . That’s going to be the moment when people need to run for the hills, if you can get out.”

NONE OF THIS IS BREAKING NEWS. Thanks to Environmental Health Trust for devoting an entire page to a segment produced by CNN about EMF weapons being used for mind control in 1985. Like totally rad – NOT.

In 1985 CNN special reports hosted by Chuck DeCaro presents the early use of Radio Frequency devices in the military and testing it’s use for remote human behavior control.

The scientists interviewed which include Dr. Robert Becker and Dr. Ross Adey show how electromagnetic fields and radio frequencies were tested as weapons of war against both machines and humans as well as counter terrorism efforts during the Cold War.

At the time Russia was at the forefront of this technology with a device since the 1960’s called the LIDA machine on psychiatric patients to alter moods and behaviors by emitting pulsed EMF, heat, sound and flashing lights as a form of mind control. “Certain kinds of weak electromagnetic signals work exactly like drugs” stated a government scientist to CNN.

Similar work by Dr. Jose Delgado achieved behavioral mind control via radio frequencies aimed at the brains of animals and humans. Delving further into the segment reveals the testing of EMF and RF for inducing hallucinations, manipulating judgement, altering brain function and intellect.

 The draft law was submitted by a Communist Party MP, Rizvan Kurbanov. It specifies that the currency will go by the name “CryptoRuble.” Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the issue of a national cryptocurrency, totally regulated by the government, in November last year. The release of CryptoRuble (CRUR) would see all other cryptocurrency mining banned in the country, Communications Minister Nikolay Nikiforov said at the time. The financial operations involving the Russian cryptocurrency are to be taxed at the rate of 13 percent applied to any appreciation in value – or 13 percent of the total if the owner can’t explain the source of the digital coins.

Is this part of the move to force the full digitization of all currencies on the planet?

 It would be much safer to assume that it is. In fact, China and India are also moving towards that same direction very openly. But does this mean that the BRICS countries are part of the move towards Technocratic Dictatorship?

 Again, it’s safer to assume that they are indeed doing it to efficiently control their own population. In fact, they have already warned us that they will make you and I want these solutions that they’ve laid down a long time ago, and you can’t refuse it really, no matter what you’re going to do.

 But the bigger question is, how will it affect the status of the fiat dollar, or the petrodollar, in the midterm?

 Would the CIA CryptoDollar still command the same respect as that of the BRICS cryptocurrencies?
• Bitcoin is US Dollar 2.0 Created by CIA | Kaspersky Co-founder

Let it be said that there is a big possibility that a coordinated effort is also being launched against Bitcoin, but why is it that the system itself is not immune to this attack, and allowed itself to become another fiat?

 It should have insulated itself from the dollar. This is the giveaway that proves it is indeed the US dollar 2.0, as recently exposed.

 Or, will the people of the planet wake up to the reality that we don’t really need to play the game at all?

 In order to understand the real motive behind the impending Russian launching of the CryptoRuble, we must consider the fact that it was the Russians who announced the obsolescence of the current paradigm through the launching of an industrial method of producing any element on the Periodic Table. The large scale transmutation of any metal into gold makes the entire economic system irrelevant.

It is also interesting to note that, while the US government is pushing the Russian gas out of the EU, it failed to stop American companies shipping Russian LNG to EU. This begs the question, who profits from the economic sanctions against the Russian if not the Deep State corporations that are behind the expensive and highly profitable winter supply of natural gas to their own people?

 This has been the formula by which the Deep State is killing the Western people economically, and through dipping their unseen hands into the public coffers. In fact, they have yet to explain the trillions lost through the Department of Defense.

 So, when the Russian government decides to compete with the CIA CryptoBubble, it is meant to kill the mother goose that the Deep State has been exploiting all along, i.e. petrodollar. How about the gold that they’ve stashed away from Asia?

 Well, it started with the Babylonian paper shuffling, it ends that way, too.

Indeed, the BRICS Alliance is now moving in for the jugular, together with the ASEAN member-countries, whose leaderships are now in India to craft the best strategy to prevent global terror from ever encroaching again, after the successful defeat of ISIS militants in Marawi City, Philippines.
• ISIS Operations in the Philippines Failed; Maute Brothers Wiped Out

In all their speeches, the phrase Global Terrorism is the term used to refer to the Deep State, and for the close observer, there is a lot of signs that the Age of Hegemony is finally over. And if the people of America can only see and understand these developments, they will begin to move for the jugular, too, and hang their leaders to the nearest lampposts.

 Until that day comes, they will remain the laughing stock across the Atlantic and the rest of the world.

You can actually participate in the global efforts to cripple the Deep State organized criminal cabal's ability for genocide, while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same time, by boycotting Big Pharma for good."

That was no surprise considering the fact that, according to official figures from China, there have been nearly 80,000 cases and the death toll is fast approaching 3,000, though outside experts suspect China is downplaying the figures and they are significantly higher than that.

What was odd about the talk, though, was Jinping also discussed the need for bio-safety at laboratories around the country in order to “protect the people’s health” and safeguard “national security.”

Equally disturbing, according to reports, was the fact that, the next day, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology issued new protocols designed to prevent biological leaks from labs, titled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”

China has a Level 4 microbiology lab called the National Biosafety Laboratory—and, of all places, it located at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, ground zero for the viral outbreak. According to the Centers for Disease Control, a biosafety lab that is level four holds high-risk microbes and pathogens that are deadly to humans.

Covid-19 has spread around the world, with hundreds of new cases popping up in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe as it continues to travel west. Italian health authorities, for example, announced that there have been 223 confirmed cases of covid-19 along with six deaths. The city of Qoms, Iran, has reported 50 deaths from the virus, which is strange considering that it is in the middle of the country. The latest figures for the United States are 35 confirmed cases with no deaths. A more comprehensive list of the cases and deaths can be found by clicking here.

On Feb. 24, Australian news reported, “The coronavirus containment has broken, with cases exploding across the world.”

The biggest concern right now for doctors and other health experts is that some people, who have caught the virus, do not show symptoms for weeks; others can be asymptomatic other than a running nose and slight fever. These people walk around public areas without knowing that they’re sick, spreading the virus to everyone they meet.

“Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the ‘window of opportunity’ to contain the disease was narrowing,” reported the Australian news agency. “But many epidemiologists fear that may have already passed. It’s in hospitals. It’s in prisons. It’s on cruise ships. It seems to be spread by carriers long before they show symptoms themselves. And that makes the virus almost impossible to contain.”"

During a recent press conference, President Trump issued a plea to the pharmaceutical industry to speed up its efforts to unveil a new vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).

The Trump administration says that Big Pharma needs to pick up the pace in unleashing the next chemical laden jab for the latest worldwide crisis, emphasizing that having to wait up to 18 months for a coronavirus vaccine to gain approval is unacceptable.

Trump’s announcement came just 15 minutes before American ally Saudi Arabia announced its first known case of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), which is believed to have come from Iran via Bahrain.

As all of this is happening, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is considering the issuance of a possible emergency declaration in response to new evidence of community spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) here in the United States.

FEMA officials say they’re preparing for an “infectious disease emergency declaration” to be issued by President Trump that would allow the federal agency to provide disaster relief funding to both state and local governments.

While Trump is insistent that Americans have nothing to worry about concerning the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), he has yet to inform the American public about how to protect itself against the virus, either with antiviral drugs or more natural antiviral substances like vitamin D. In fact, almost nobody in any position of authority has made one single mention about preventative measures other than for people to wash their hands.

There was once a time when the federal government urged Americans to take precautionary measures on their own to prevent infection from outbreaks. But today, the only message being conveyed is to just sit tight and let the government handle it – and when has that ever led to positive results?

The president’s failure to communicate with the American public about tried-and-true methods of naturally boosting immunity is nothing short of disappointing, but it’s hardly surprising.

Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses three natural molecules that can help to fight the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) pandemic:

Oops: CDC releases woman with novel coronavirus in Texas

Over in the Lone Star State, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reportedly released a woman from quarantine who tested twice negative for the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), only to later test positive in another test result received by the federal agency.

“Unfortunately, after the person’s release, the CDC received the results of another test that showed a weakly positive confirmation of the virus that causes CoVid-19,” stated Ron Nirenberg, the mayor of San Antonio.

Up in Seattle, at least four additional people have died from the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), bringing the total number of deaths in the U.S. to at least six. Five of these deaths occurred in King County, with the remaining fatality being reported in Snohomish County.

This concerning uptick in both deaths and new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) has many people worrying that medical martial law could be on the way not just in Washington state but throughout the country as authorities seek to contain it.

“There are already thousands of infections across America which have not yet been tested – all by design, of course, as the CDC withheld testing kits from hospitals and local health officials across the country,” writes the Health Ranger.

“By our best estimates, there are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 infections in America, mostly along the West Coast (Seattle and Northern California) with new outbreaks taking place in New York City, Miami, Chicago and other major cities.”

The vaccine industry is busy concocting a new jab for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), but radio talk show host Michael Savage is having none of it.

During a recent broadcast, Savage announced that he plans to refuse any Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine that ends up being foisted on the masses because it will be “ineffective and dangerous.”

“I would join a militia before I took a vaccine,” he stated. “I’d go to the hills. I’m not taking it – I refuse.”

You can listen to his entire Savage Nation broadcast at this link.

Savage, by the way, is of the same perspective as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is both real and killing people. He does not, however, support the agenda of eugenicist Bill Gates, who wants to unveil both vaccines and “digital certificates” to prove vaccination status.

“Covid vaccine – I will refuse to take it!” Savage went on to proclaim. “It will be ineffective and dangerous. There are now 20 known mutations!”

Like many of us, Savage has never taken a flu shot, either. Flu shots do not work, for one. They are also highly dangerous, and thus not worth the risk.

Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, warns that the people pushing vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) are quacks:

As we, too, often receive, negative comments began to flood Savage’s Twitter feed following his remarks. One individual wrote that he had never heard Savage advocate against vaccines on the radio, adding that “flu shots help to keep people safe against the flu.”

This same commenter added that he hopes “the same will be true of (a) coronavirus vaccine.”

Savage immediately shot back with a comment of “wrong!” adding that flu shots are “at most 50% effective and frequently produce severe side effects.”

Savage is almost right, as flu shots are pretty much zero percent effective when you really look at the data. Between the flu they often cause, not to mention the horrific side effects, it is questionable at best to suggest that they provide any benefits whatsoever.

But the point is that Savage is right on when it comes to a future Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. There is no chance that it will work or be safe, and yet there will almost certainly be calls by many to make it a mandatory rite of passage to be allowed back into society.

This is the slippery slope of tyranny that we have been warning our readers about for years. All forms of medicine require informed consent, and if the option to decline is removed then all you have left is a total medical police state, which is what the world is now seeing form right before our very eyes.

“I tweeted something that got me mad, because they’re all talking about a COVID vaccine, and I know, having studied these things, having studied the flu vaccines which are about thirty to forty, maybe forty percent effective,” Savage further explained during his broadcast.

“… if you look at flu vaccines, not only are they ineffective – thirty-seven percent to fifty percent is what we’re seeing in reports – there are huge side effects to flu vaccines.”

He concluded that rushing a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) will be a disaster, and that he is basically willing to do whatever it takes to avoid having to be forcibly injected with one.

Shipp explains, “Hillary Clinton was running and is running a global financial criminal syndicate. She was using these secret servers to conduct Clinton financial money laundering business.”

“The shocking thing about that is all the former directors of the CIA that have come out to support her, from Clapper to Brennan to Morell to Robert Gates supporting her being elected, knew about this criminal syndicate. Comey was protecting it. Lynch was protecting it. Weissmann was protecting it. And that is the big why. What’s she got on these people? Are they financial ties? They had to be aware of this, especially the counter-intelligence units. We know it was hacked into by foreign intelligence services because it was just hanging out there. Hillary Clinton was running a secret server outside the Department of State for the purposes of laundering money through the criminal Clinton Foundation.”

Are the crimes and treason of the Clinton Foundation the anvil that is about to drop? Shipp says,

“It’s not just an anvil, I think it is a mountain and the nexus of everything. This “Clinton Global Initiative” (CGI) is worldwide, and it’s been out there for a couple of decades. It has now intertwined former Directors of the CIA and FBI. George Soros is a part of it. It’s connected to all kinds of global financial institutions…

It is at least a $100 billion…

All these people protecting and defending Hillary Clinton and knowing about her criminal syndicate, this goes into the so-called ‘Deep State’ of our government, and it is connected, involved and intertwined in the global criminal crime syndicate called the Clinton Foundation. This is probably going to be the biggest scandal in U.S. history–once it’s busted. I think they are quietly working on it now, and I think they have been for the last year. It is so huge the arrests and indictments could cause a Constitutional crisis with some people being removed. Maybe that’s why they are moving slowly. It all comes back down to the Clinton Foundation and the criminal syndicate.”

Is former President Obama involved with the Clinton crime syndicate? Shipp says,

“Yes, I am absolutely convinced of it. George Soros gave $30 million to Obama’s campaign. Then he gave $27.1 million to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Both Obama and Clinton are tied directly into George Soros. Obama was put into office with millions of dollars that came out of nowhere.

Yes, he’s part of this cabal. Yes, he’s part of this global syndicate, and in my opinion, the subversion of our government.”

In closing, Shipp contends,“There could be a Constitutional crisis in that we could see Congressmen, Senators, former Directors of the FBI and the CIA perp walked after they receive charges.”

“Could you imagine if senior DOJ officials were arrested, some Congressmen and Senators were arrested and other government officials were arrested on charges and walked out of office? That’s the Constitutional crisis I am talking about. Those kind of high level arrests would shake up this nation. It would be huge, and that’s why it has taken so long and methodical in doing this.”

Kennedy last week, media outlets within the United States and around the world have been scrambling to find any new information regarding the death of our 35th president. In the process, a document has been uncovered that reveals something that may or may not be surprising to Americans across the country – that former Democratic President Lyndon Johnson was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

“Ned Touchstone, editor of The Councilor, has been identified by a confidential informant as a member of the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,” the document states. “The source advised in December, 1963, that Touchstone claimed that the Klan had documented proof that President Johnson was formerly a member of the Klan in Texas during the early days of his political career.”

While it may come as a shock to some, the fact that President Johnson was formerly a member of the Ku Klux Klan is rather unsurprising for a number of reasons. The first has to do with the fact that on multiple occasions, President Lyndon Johnson allegedly made racial slurs, which for decades has led many Americans to believe that Johnson himself viewed the white race as superior to blacks.

“I’ll have those n****** voting Democratic for the next 200 years,” Johnson allegedly said to two governors on Air Force One at one point during his presidency. Another time, President Johnson said, “These Negroes, they’re getting pretty uppity these days and that’s a problem for us… Now we’ve got to do something about this, we’ve got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference.”

The second reason why these revelations about President Johnson are actually rather unsurprising is because throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th century, the Democrat Party has been the party of slavery, racism and segregation. As a matter of fact, between the years 1866 and 1966, the Democrat Party rejected every single piece of civil rights legislation that made its way through the halls of Congress.

When it came to the 13th Amendment of the United States Constitution, which officially freed the slaves, the vast majority of Democrats voted against it while only four voted in favor of it. The Democrats also opposed the 14th Amendment, which granted slaves United States citizenship, while the Republican Party overwhelmingly supported it. When it came time to vote for the 15th Amendment, which gave slaves the right to vote, not a single one of the 56 Democrats in Congress at the time voted in favor of it.

As the United States moved into the 20th century, iconic Democratic figures such as John F. Kennedy were rejecting civil rights legislation such as the famous Civil Rights Act of 1957. Democratic Senator Al Gore Sr. of Tennessee also opposed it.

Hey *****,

 

 Here are some resources to help answers your questions...

I hope you will take the time to listen to those helpful sermons. Certainly, every believer will rejoice to be in Heaven, but we cannot ignore plain Scriptures such as Daniel 12:3, ""And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever."" So believers who don't mature to bear fruit will NOT shine in Heaven. Luke 8:11-15 is a parable about soul-winning, the parable of the sower and the seeds. We reap what we sow, and won't reap what we don't sow. 

 

 We don't read about ""every tear"" being wiped away until AFTER the 1,000 reign of Christ during the millennium (Revelation 21:4). The Holy Bible teaches in 1st Corinthians 3:11-15 that some believers will SUFFER LOSS at the Judgment Seat of Christ, losing everything, except their eternal security. That won't be a happy moment. You mentioned the sins in your life Nipun. Christ has already paid for our sins at Calvary on the cross. This is why 2nd Corinthians 5:10-11 says that the Lord will judge us as believers ""that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad"" and not our ""sins."" So we won't face the punishment of our sins, but we will suffer missed opportunities, the time wasted, the lost blessings, positions of leadership, eternal possessions, et cetera. 

 

 When a believer sins, committing a crime, a believer can be restored to sweet fellowship with God. They can obtain the SAME Holy Spirit power and walk with God, but they have forfeited the former position they may have held. They have missed out on blessings and opportunities. They have missed out on souls they could have won to Christ. Albeit, they can never lose their salvation. They can claim the SAME promises. God doesn't have different promises to those who don't go into sin, verses those who do go into sin. Dr. Hyles explains this truth in this MP3 sermon...

There will be tears in Heaven. Rock ""king,"" Elvis Presley lived a life of sin and shame. I seriously doubt if Elvis never led anyone to Christ. Dr. Hyles once witnessed the Gospel to Elvis in an elevator in Dallas, Texas, and was convinced that Elvis is saved. I believe he was too, from what I have read from Elvis' family. If Elvis is in Heaven, he is rejoicing. His sins are under the blood; but Elvis missed out on all that he could have done for God, wasting his life here on earth. The worst thing about sin is not the sin itself, but the good that it hinders us from doing. Elvis is sad in Heaven, in his rejoicing, knowing that he missed out on so many opportunities to use his fame and fortune for the cause of Christ, but he DIDN'T. This is the only logical conclusion that we can make from Daniel 12:3, Revelation 21:4 and Luke 8:15. 

 

 What would be the incentive to ""lay up treasures in Heaven"" (Matthew 6:19-20), as Jesus said, if every believer will receive the same rewards? We can earn back lost rewards while still on earth. We cannot lose our position in Christ, nor the blessed presence of the Holy Spirit, nor our peace, nor our hope of a better life in Heaven, nor of all the unconditional promises of God. Some promises are conditional, like laying up treasures in Heaven. Certainly, the greatest treasures of all is eternal life, our family in Heaven and our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, which we can never lose. I don't claim to have all the answers. I am not quite sure how it all works, but by examining the Scriptures, I am convinced that some believers will be happier than others in Heaven. 

 

 Albeit, since the Scriptures tell us that every tear shall be wiped away at the end of the millennium, that must mean that those tears and sadness over our earthly failures must end too. How could the tears stop if the pain of our failures didn't? Christ bore the punishment of our sins on the cross, but the Bible says we must still have to give account for the good and the bad done in our body. I always compare the two judgment to criminal court verses civil court. Thanks be to Christ, we can never be in danger of God's criminal court at the Great White Throne of Judgment. However, we can still suffer loss in civil court, where we stand to lose rewards at the Judgment Seat of Christ. The Bible says that if we are faithful in little, God will make us ruler over much; but if we have not been faithful in that which is least, God will not trust us to rule over much. So I believe that our position of leadership, as we rule with Christ over the earth during His 1,000 year millennial reign, will be decided by our faithfulness here on earth."

“Description: The management team in the Stockholm Cooperation Region has jointly decided that the county’s players will participate in the Sea Eagle Exercise 2019. It is highlighted, partly as an important preparatory step for TFÖ 2020, and as an important activity to achieve the ambition in the common target image 2019-2022 .

“Sea Eagle 2019 is designed as a broad simulation exercise. It contains elements of gray-zone problems, with extensive social disturbances, disinformation and informational impacts and elements of serious antagonistic acts. The various exercises will highlight possible challenges for society’s crisis preparedness capacity and will place demands on the region’s ability to act in a coordinated manner at agreed levels of cooperation. The scenario will provide the conditions for practicing, testing and continuing to develop areas of ability within the state civil service, emergency preparedness and civil defense. In preparation for the main exercise, a number of knowledge-enhancing measures will be implemented. The main exercise will take place on October 23-24 and will last for 36 hours, which provides opportunities for each player to test their ability to endure.

The Iron Man star claims the social and political elite is now living in fear of Donald Trump’s attempts to drain the swamp, including his strong campaign to take down the pedophile rings that have infested the United States.

The oligarchs have “accelerated their agenda, bringing their endgame closer,” which is, according to Downey Jr., to “turn America into a prison.”

Robert Downey Jr., who has been filming the latest installment of Marvel’s Avengers series in Atlanta , also blasted the mainstream media’s “official” narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting, telling production staff that he has stayed at Mandalay Bay and there is “no way” suspected gunman Stephen Paddock could have taken all those weapons up to his room undetected.

“I’ve been to that hotel [Mandalay Bay], they have special weapons detectors installed and there is no way they would have allowed weapons in unless they were cooperating with either a federal law enforcement team or, you know, a fake law enforcement team.”

 “The whole story stinks to high heaven.

” In August the Iron Man star exposed a huge Hollywood network of pedophilia, prostitution, and human trafficking that involves a whole host of what he described as “sick f*cks”.

 Now Downey Jr. is taking aim at the deep state.

“You know there was a FEMA drill taking place in Las Vegas that day?

“There was a FEMA drill and then suddenly it went live. Took all the actors by surprise. Suddenly it’s real bullets.

“We’ve seen this happen so many times before.”

“They didn’t even send an Emergency Response Team for hours – not for the drill, not for the real dead and injured.

“That many people did not have to die.

“Many more died for lack of a proper response caused by confusion. It was treason in high places.”

 Mr. Downey Jr. says he doesn’t believe the FBI is responsible for the massacre, but he does believe they know more than they are willing to admit, and they know exactly who agents should be questioning.

“They have their hands tied. “You can see the fear on their faces.

“They know what they are dealing with and it’s above their pay grade.”

“Really they should be tying these top guys down.

“We are at a unique point in history where maybe something can be done about the power structure that has infiltrated the deep state.

“These treasonous psychopaths should be questioned intensively, and with the use of polygraphs and if necessary truth-serum.”

 Downey Jr. said he believes that the US government will allow the perpetrators walk free and also allow them to make billions from selling unnecessary security services and equipment, which will eventually lead to the United States becoming a giant prison, with people’s every move being under constant surveillance.

“JFK was assassinated by the CIA and Mossad.

“Martin Luther King was assassinated by an Army sniper working for the FBI.

“The USS Liberty, strafed and torpedoed by the Israelis, with a long-running cover-up by the government led by Lyndon f##king Johnson.

“And don’t forget 9/11,”

 Mr. Downey Jr. also pointed out that the Las Vegas tragedy presented an opportunity for the people to demand a change.

“Let me spell it out even more clearly for you – even if this was a government massacre using actual CIA and FBI employees in support of a top secret ‘compartmented’ massacre on top of a FEMA drill, the President and the new Director of the FBI have a unique opportunity here.”

They can “investigate, illuminate, indict, and incarcerate.”

“The lawless ones have been dug in deep as a tick on my hound’s ass for a long time now.

“Everyone knows this. But if this happens, if we all get to see a billionaire do hard time, it will change America for the better.

“It will restore the legitimacy of the federal government in everybody’s eyes.”"

Well, well…here comes the alternative media (article below) with the revelation that the British were involved in the coup. Richard Dearlove and Arvinder Sambei are two British operatives who are Robert Mueller’s handlers. They have been meddling in US affairs since 911 when they used fake news about weapons of mass destruction to get us involved in almost two decades of war.

Our research took us right into the Privy Council as the origins of the coup. We used EVIDENCE to lead us to truth and once the fake news reporters like John Solomon and Sara Carter stop swimming in the shallow end of the truth pool with their limited Fox News hangout, we will all get to truth a lot faster. The British monarchy attempted the overthrow of Donald Trump. This is the origin of the coup.

Take, for example, geoengineering, which, among other things, involves the atmospheric spraying of aluminum, strontium, barium, plastics and other materials into the sky as a means of ostensibly protecting us from the dangers of global warming.

Mainstream media has been reporting on geoengineering quite a bit in recent years, pitching it as a necessary evil to come, never quite fully divulging the years of evidence we’ve collected which shows how governments the world over are already tampering with the earth’s climate.

Rosalind Peterson, President of the Agriculture Defense Coalition at a UN conference on climate change about geoengineering and weather modification. In 2014 we reported on Lisa Murkowski’s (U.S. Senator – AK) statements in Congress about the HAARP program and it’s purpose of controlling the ionosphere. NASA has acknowledged spraying chemicals such as lithium into the atmosphere over major American cities.

USA Today recently ran an interesting piece about geoengineering, suggesting that such programs would be coming in the near future, while outlining the case that once these programs officially begin\

In this video, an ex-military meteorologist explains that anomalous radar readings are the result of the military spraying chaff into the atmosphere.

“Then you see these bands of very distinct cloud cover moving into the region. That is not rain, that is not snow. Believe it or not military aircraft flying through the region dropping chaff: small bits of aluminum, sometimes it’s made of plastic or even metallicized paper products, but it’s used as an anti-radar issue and obviously they’re practicing. Now they won’t confirm that, but I was in the Marine Corps for many years and I’ll tell you right now, that’s what it is.” [Source]

In this video, a meteorolgist in Southern California talks about chaff again, noting that it has been sprayed over the region and is interfering with satellite data.

Again, another reporter from Southern California explains chaff being dispersed into the atmosphere over the region.

In this video from Florida, the local weatherman again talks about the military releasing chaff into the sky.

It’s interesting to see how spraying aluminum and other products into the skies above populated areas is treated as a non-issue by local news. Aluminum is known to cause a wide range of serous health problems including brain damage and Alzheimer’s. It makes you wonder what else is happening in our skies that is not being reported on by the news.

Use of geoengineering is supported by members of the scientific community working in line with the climate change alarmists. These modifications extend to plate tectonics, ocean fertilization, cloud seeding, Co2 sequestration and military weaponry.

Project Cirrus (PC), a.k.a. Project Stormfury), was conducted by the US government between 1962 and 1983 in an attempt to manipulate the weather by affecting hurricane behavior.

PC was headed by General Electric, the US Army Signal Corps, the Office of Naval Research and the US Air Force .

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) states in their study that “climate engineering technologies, focusing on their technical status, future directions for research and potential responses.” The GAO reviewed the scientific literature and government reports, consulted experts with a wide variety of backgrounds and viewpoints, and surveyed 1,006 adults across the United States.

The GAO concluded that “climate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change.”

For more than a decade, first the United States and then Canada’s citizens have been subjected to a 24/7/365 day aerosol assault over our heads made of a toxic brew of poisonous heavy metals, chemicals, and other dangerous ingredients. None of this was reported by any mainstream media. The US Department of Defense (DOD) and military have been systematically blanketing all our skies with what are known as Chemtrails (also known as Stratospheric Aerosol Geoengineering). The GAO admits that current geoengineering techniques are immature and that many of them could have potentially negative consequences. Yet, the consensus of governmental agencies has chosen to disregard the health hazards to the general public in favor of the continued use of geoengineering. Scientists in support of geoengineering, knowing “major technology risks or limited future climate change” show their bias toward the “science”. The GAO have looked toward the private sector because governments and corporations working with them subvert their findings and conduct experiments worldwide without consent. According to the Geoengineering: Governance and Technology Policy (GGTP) report, produced by the Congressional Research Service, the US government “has joined with other nations . . . as a participant in several international agreements on climate change.” The experimental aspect of geoengineering in the US is directed in the “absence of a comprehensive [climate change] policy” that will “modify the Earth’s climate” and make these technologies available to “foreign governments and entities in the private sector to use unilaterally without authorization from the US government or an international treaty.’ Oversight concerning geoengineering research and experimental projects is allocated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DoE), Department of Agriculture (DoA), and the Department of Defense. Although there is no provision, many of the UN’s international treaties relating to climate change, maritime pollution and air pollution are used to govern the pursuit of geoengineering. In 2010, the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) outlined the necessity of geoengineering for the sake of saving the Earth’s biodiversity. The US government, using the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as their guide, has created policies to mitigate the fabled effects of man-made climate change.

potential environmental risks and benefits of various proposals, associated domestic and international governance issues, evaluation mechanisms and criteria, research and development (R&D) needs, and economic rationales supporting the deployment of geoengineering activities. The United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and India provided scientists that supported the engagement of geoengineering technologies in the name of reducing emissions, preserving “climate sensitivity”, and climate thresholds under the pursuit of political, social and economic mitigation strategies. The UN’s assertion that climate change is directly causal to humans has inspired mandates for geoengineering governance. This scheme does not rely on scientific data or research studies, but rather real world experiments with chemtrail technologies conducted by governmental agencies and private sector corporations employed by policymakers and international entities. Through the covering of governmental policy, the UN hopes to design technologies to control the climate; advance geoengineering options in lieu of effectively mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (for example, could result in a number of adverse effects, including ocean acidification, stresses on biodiversity, climate sensitivity shocks, and other irreversible consequences); engage the private sector corporations by enticing them with government subsidies while examining their ownership models, intellectual property rights and trade and transfer mechanisms for the dissemination of geoengineering technologies. While the UN anticipated that the general public would become aware of their schemes (as is happening now) they planned a propaganda campaign to assert transparency while hiding the actuality of critical technologies to avoid liabilities and compensation to the public for adverse effects of geoengineering. To cover up their unethical impact on the Earth, the UN created “ information” to be made available to the public and hired scientists to praise their deployment of geoengineering. John Holdren, US Science Adviser to Obama, has come out publicly to claim that geoengineering will assist the planet in stabilizing its weather with regard to global warming. Holdren says geoengineering is a perfectly viable way to cool the planet’s temperature. He fully supports the process of releasing particles of barium, magnesium, aluminum, nano-fibers, bacillus blood spores and other chemicals to reflect sunlight away from the Earth. The implementation of geoengineering, a scheme of the UN’s decisive endeavor to create global governance, is not only fully supported by the US government, but the UN’s direct policies and procedures are literally adopted as strategies of the Obama administration.

It suggests that the Chinese government secretly developed the coronavirus, there was a cover-up story, and there is deliberate omission of information about the role played by forces inside the US. This secrecy supports the speaker's explanation of why something is a conspiracy and not a mainstream theory.","Here is one of the best investigative documentaries ever produced – as far as it goes. However, what it omits makes it one of the most dangerous as well. The praiseworthy part is that it reveals how the Chinese government secretly developed the corona virus in a bio-weapons laboratory in Wuhan, how the virus escaped into the population, and how the fish-market story was a crude cover up. The documentary’s analysis of China’s long-standing goal to destroy the US using non-military tactics also is on target. The problem arises when we realize there is no mention of the role played by forces inside the US. There is no mention of the CDC, the American based pharmaceutical industry, the Deep State, the US media, fake death statistics, deliberate destruction of the economy, or tycoon American billionaires such as Bill Gates who stand to profit beyond imagination.

This documentary becomes so focused on the threat of Chinese Communists and their operatives in the US that we forget about America’s own home-grown communists who go under the banner of Democrats, Republicans, Green Party, justice warriors, health officials, network news anchors, and all the obedient governors and mayors who eagerly use the exaggerated health threat to take away the last of our liberties.

This is reminiscent of the Iran-Contra affair in the late 1980s when Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver North admitted he had lied to Congress under oath, participated in illegal arms sales to Iran, diverted proceeds of those sales to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, and was secretly creating a massive database to spy on all Americans. In spite of all this, he became an American hero in the eyes of the public, because he said he did these things to protect America from the threat of Communism in South America. Americans were not concerned about North helping to create a totalitarian government above all rules so long as it is done in the name of fighting Communism or some other great enemy.

Not much has changed since then. The database that North helped to design now is a monstrous reality in the name of fighting terrorism. On December 5, 2017, it was announced that Oliver North and Blackwater founder Erik Prince had teamed up to help Donald Trump create a secret spy agency that reports just to the President. This was to help the President overcome opposition from the Deep State and from Communist China.

Bottom line: Watch this documentary for the truth about what is happening in China and the fact that China’s leadership can hardly wait for the fall of America, but then reflect on the rest of the story, which is that America’s greatest threat comes from within, especially if Americans allow their government to become no different than the Chinese government. -GEG"

Hillary Clinton slammed President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, saying it would help if he actually tried “giving a damn.”

The twice-failed presidential candidate tweeted Trump offering to “spell” out what needs to happen in order to contain the virus.

“I know this is all hard for you, @realdonaldtrump , so let me spell it out,” Mrs. Clinton wrote.

Clinton then suggested the President support measures such as free coronavirus testing, and federally mandated paid sick leave and “giving a damn.”

But some of Clinton's suggestions were already unveiled by House Democrats on Wednesday.

NewsThud reported that Trump had waived all federal student loan interest “until further notice” amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Trump said he had done so by executive action during a ceremony in the Rose Garden Friday afternoon.

“To help our students and their families, I have waived interest on all student loans held by federal government agencies, and that will be until further notice,” Trump said.

“That’s a big thing for a lot of students who have been left in the middle right now.”

Trump also announced at the ceremony that he would declare a national emergency over the virus, which will free up federal resources to help state and local governments respond to the pandemic.

Several colleges and universities across the country have closed and shifted to remote classes amid the outbreak.

Trump’s decision will help Americans who may struggle to keep up with student loan payments during the outbreak, which has rattled the stock market and sowed concerns about the adverse impact on the U.S. economy.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has advised six presidents on HIV/AIDS and many other domestic and global health issues, praised Trump's handling of the crisis during a Friday interview.

The United States has a head start on containing the coronavirus because of President Trump's unprecedented travel restrictions, Dr. Fauci says.""

""Clearly, early on, we made a travel ban with regard to China -- that was a very smart move right there,"" Fauci said."

Ever since World War II, unexplained and unexplainable aerial and oceanic sightings have been on the rise, culminating in an explosion of first-hand evidence of all kinds: personal reports, phone camera stills and videos, sophisticated night vision recordings, and military images.

The sheer number of reported sightings is staggering. Yet, the United States government remains silent on this ultra-top secret clearance, tabooed subject.

Other world leaders have confirmed what two-thirds of the American people believe already (according to polls): that UFOs and ETs do exist. Not only that, they walk among us and have business deals with the larcenous few who keep all the high-tech alien goodies for themselves, keeping the rest of us enslaved economically to Big Oil, Big Banks, and Big Pharma.

One of the most outspoken government officials to confirm these “unidentified” objects do exist and that all governments know about them, is former Canadian Minister of Defense Paul Hellyer. A vocal promoter of international UFO disclosure, Hellyer is featured in several YouTube videos. In this one, he testifies before the Citizen Hearing on UFOs in May 2013, when six former members of Congress received stipends of $20,000 each to hear 30 hours of testimony about UFOs at the National Press Club.

If you can’t trust and believe a former national Minister of Defense – the person in charge of all military operations – who can you trust?

The list of insider and eyewitness evidence continues to mount, due in large part to Dr. Steven Greer who founded the Disclosure Project in 2001. To date, Greer has documented on video “over 500 government, military, and intelligence community witnesses testifying to their direct, personal, first-hand experience with UFOs, ETs, ET technology, and the cover-up that keeps this information secret.”

Another UFO secret technology advocate and future thinker is Foster Gamble who left his father’s megabusiness, Proctor and Gamble, in order to spread the truth about government suppression and oppression. He and his wife Kimberly founded the Thrive movement to shed light on the darkness surrounding us. From their movie of the same name, regarding the deafening silence here in the US and other nations, despite a preponderance of evidence supporting the actual factuality of UFOs and ETs:

What will it take to convince the United States controllers to admit they have been lying to Us the People for at least the past 70 years? What will it take to erode their power base and bring “elite” technologies to the average citizen?

Understand that, in addition to individual confirmations about an extraterrestrial presence here on Earth, entire countries are making public all their ufological records. But have you ever heard about this in mainstream media?

France was the first country in the world to come clean about the touchy subject of UFOs in 2007, as The Washington Post announced:

“The voluntary decision by France’s National Center for Space Studies to dump more than 100,000 pages of witness testimony, photographs, film footage and audiotapes from its secret UFO archives onto its Internet site, http://www.cnes.fr, for worldwide viewing is an unprecedented move among Western countries.”

The French government decided 11 years ago to admit, loud and clear, what the United States and other countries will not, to further scientific exploration and analysis of this truly puzzling phenomenon.

In Chile, the national agency which investigates UFOs (called CEFAA) released “an exceptional nine-minute Navy video of a UFO displaying highly unusual behavior, studied by Chilean authorities for the last two years,” according to The Huffington Post. The film was by shot from a helicopter by two experienced Navy officers.

As incredible as it may seem to us, who live within the biggest lie ever told to humanity:

“The Chilean government agency always makes its cases public when an investigation is complete, and acknowledges the existence of UAP [unidentified aerial phenomena] when a case merits such a conclusion.”

To be fair, the United States has quietly released an enormous amount of formerly classified UFO documents – did you miss the memo?

The CIA put more than 12 MILLION PAGES of declassified material on their website in January 2017, but can anyone remember hearing about it on the nightly news?

Greer and associates’ Sirius Disclosure website lists all countries releasing UFO information. Here they are, in alphabetical order:

With all these people in all these countries talking candidly, openly, and honestly about extraterrestrial beings and their craft, what in the world is going on in the United States? The answer is… a whole lot of nothing.

Or so the CIA (which enforces the NSA’s gag orders) would have you believe. The reality is that thanks to pioneers in this field like founder of Paradigm Research Group Stephen Basset, the first ET disclosure lobbyist in Washington, DC, more and more influential ears are being opened to the notion that it’s time for this cover-up to stop.

When you get luminaries like genius inventor Elon Musk (and lesser luminaries like Blink-182 singer Tom DeLonge) speaking out about the existence of something dedicated researchers have long concluded is genuine, how much longer will this international cat stay in its federal bag?

The reality is that UFO and ET disclosure is happening right here, right now, on a planet near you. Can you handle the truth?"
750,False,The article does not suggest any conspiracy theories.,True,"The article mentions the US State Department, Hillary Clinton, diplomats, world leaders, and the government as actors.",True,"The article mentions the release of emails, the failure to meet a court-order mandate, the upgrading of documents to classified, and the government's classification of emails.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article discusses various controversies and revelations related to the emails.,True,The article mentions the omission of classified emails from the court-issued request and the State Department's control over the release of information.,"The US State Department released another batch of 5,500 emails belonging to former Secretary of State and current 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, just before the new year commenced.

While the batch of emails at first glance contain little insight or outed sensitive information, the release actually fell short of a court-order mandate of providing public access to 82 percent of Clinton’s messages while Secretary of State by the end of 2015. The last minute effort was clearly intended to mitigate the consequences of not meeting the sanctioned mandate.

The emails are from the private server of the former Secretary of State and previous releases have stirred controversy about her relationships with diplomats and world leaders, among other things.

According to the State Department, it failed to reach the court’s quota because of “""the large number of documents involved and the holiday schedule.""





Evidently, parts of some 275 documents in the latest release were upgraded to classified--not to be released to the public and omitted from the court-issued request--despite the fact that the classified emails were not designated as such when they were originally sent to Clinton’s email.

1,274 of the emails were classified by the government before their release.

In recognizing its failure to reach the goal set for 2015, the US State Department has pledged to continue releasing emails from Clinton’s private server while Secretary of State, continuing into January.

Some of the controversies unearthed in the latest batch of emails include Clinton’s apparent anger at being airbrushed out of the now famuos picture of Obama’s cabinet on the night of the raid by US Navy Seals that killed Osama Bin Laden. In May 2011, Clinton complains about the New-York based Yiddish language Hasidic newspaper, saying “that a NY Hasidic paper Der Zeitung published the sit room photo w/o me (or Audrey T) photoshopped out perhaps because no woman should be in such a place of power or that I am dressed immodestly!!”

The Israeli media has been particularly indignant about Clinton’s tone in this correspondence, defending the modesty concerns of the newspaper that caused the picture to be airbrushed.

Another interesting, albeit not particularly exciting revelation, concerns President Obama’s push for health care reform and apparent secrecy from Clinton. Writing to Obama health reform adviser Neera Tanden, Clinton asks ""Is there a new strategy? I know POTUS will speak on 9/9. Will we hear the specifics of what the Admin wants Congress to do? Let me know if I can help?""

Tanden’s response is also revealed, calling for Clinton to be more involved in the process. She responds two days later saying ""The President's policy instincts are to do good and decent things, but the rest of the Administration is just, well, beyond complicated. It's a bit too much for email.""

While more emails are expected to come in January, it should be noted that ultimately the State Department has final say over what is and is not released or censored in the emails, and if they do not want information to be released, despite a court order, they will prevent it."

Could Jesus just have had a heart attack shoveling snow when He was old? What about the Old Testament examples of the blood sacrifice? They extend from Abel, to Noah, and all throughout the entire Old Testament. The Bible says, “Without shedding of blood is no remission” (Heb. 9:22). Heb. 9:12 tell us that “By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us” (See also Rev. 11:19). Does MacArthur get his Scripture-twisters from sources such as Vine and new versions that often substitute the word “death” for the word “blood”? Why does Vine change, “through faith in his blood?” (vol. 4, p. 137). Vine says,

“The ‘blood’ of Christ stands for his death...”

 “The blood does not simply denote the physical material, it stands for the death of Christ” (vol. 4, pp. 137,251).

Vine writes heresy about “the blood” in his essay entitled, “The Table of The Lord and The Lord's Supper.” He feels that the ‘blood’ is simply used to “illustrate” his death, just as the term the “table” of The Lord illustrates the communion. The blood was not merely a ‘picture.’ It was God's blood offered for our sins.

Vine and MacArthur share another subtle theological error. Tinges of MacArthur's Lordship Salvation mar Vine's interpretations (based on Vine's rendition of Rom. 10:9). Vine says,

“When he expounds the conditions upon which salvation is to be possessed, he stresses the necessity of acknowledging the Lordship of Christ: If thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord” (bold mine, vol. 4, p. 117; vol. 1, p. 403).

Vine changes the KJV's text from the reading, “confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus...” to “confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord” (Vine and his R.V. contradict themselves by omitting “Lord” many times and also by demoting our “Lord” to a mere ‘Master’ (e.g., vol. 4, p. 130). ...

When you read Vine's you are not reading ‘Greek’; you are really reading Westcott, Hort and Thayer. You are not reading ‘Hebrew’; you are reading Gesenius' and his Old Testament Lexicon. Vine's additional sources are listed here in bold type (vol. 1, p. 34). (All of these men's heresies have merited a chapter in this book or a discussion in the author's other books New Age Bible Versions, The Language of the King James Bible, or In Awe of Thy Word.)

Vine's An Expository Dictionary of Old Testament Words recommends the following materials which were available during Vine's life (Old Tappan, N.J.; Fleming Revell Company, 1978, see the bibliography of David Huttar, pp. 169, 172, 173, 176)."

As if the upcoming French election hasn’t been contentious enough, some liberal-minded French citizens are petitioning to add Barack Obama to the mix.

The “Obama 17” campaign is hoping to get one million signatures for their petition by March 15 in an effort to persuade Obama to enter his name for the 2017 French election.

The petition is an odd and desperate move by the liberals, who are nervous about the growing popularity of populism and nationalism presented by front runners Marine Le Pen and Francois Fillion.

The “Obama 17” movement gained notoriety this week when posters depicting Obama with the phrase “Oui on Peut” or “Yes We Can” were plastered around Paris calling for citizens to visit the website and sign the petition.

The site claims: “Barack Obama has completed his second term as President of the United States, why not hire him as president of France?… Barack Obama has the best resume in the world for the job… Because at a time when France is about to vote massively for the extreme right, we can still give a lesson of democracy to the planet by electing a French President, a foreigner.” (RELATED: Get all the news Google is blocking at Censored.news)

According to NPR, the petition has received about 27,000 signatures so far. One of the site’s founders told NPR that he thought up the idea for the campaign with four friends “after a drink.” Those must have been some incredibly strong cocktails.

One of the creators of the site, who requested to have his name withheld said, “We were thinking about French politics and saying that we were fed up with the fact that we all the time had to vote against someone and how it would be cool to be able to vote for someone we admire. We came up with Obama. I think the whole world would love to have him as president.” Perhaps they are unaware that Obama’s average approval rating is lower than that of Nixon or both Bush’s.

This is not the first time French citizens have petitioned for Obama’s leadership. There are two similar petitions on Change.org, but neither has gained as much recognition as this one.

There is a small fact, however, that in order to run for president in France Obama would have to be naturalized as a French Citizen before the election. Not that he’s ever had problem faking citizenship.

Thankfully these French liberals are somewhat realistic. The site creator also explained to NPR that Obama 2017 isn’t meant to rally support for any French candidate or party, it’s an expression of frustration about politicians in France in general.

“We don’t know politics,” he says. “We aren’t coming with real stuff. We’re just proposing something to make people think.”"
753,True,The article discusses a deliberate plan to dump sulfate chemicals into the atmosphere for the purpose of fighting global warming. It suggests that this plan is being funded by Bill Gates and raises concerns about the potential negative consequences of such actions.,True,The article mentions Bill Gates as the founder and funder of the research fund that is funding the project.,True,The article discusses the deliberate release of sulfate chemicals into the atmosphere as part of the project.,True,"The article raises concerns about the potential damage to ecosystems, disruption of rainfall, and threats to food supplies that could result from the release of sulfate particles.",True,"The article connects events and observations (e.g., the funding of the project by Bill Gates, the potential negative consequences of the project) to suggest a larger integrated whole.",False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"(NaturalNews) Geo-engineers are finally coming out of the “chemtrail” closet, as reports are now emerging about deliberate plans in the works to dump untold tons of sulfate chemicals into the atmosphere for the purported purpose of fighting so-called “global warming.”

The U.K.’s Guardian and others are reporting that a multi-million dollar research fund, which just so happens to have been started and funded by Microsoft founder and vaccine enthusiast Bill Gates, is being used to fund the project. A large balloon hovering at 80,000 feet over Fort Sumner, New Mexico, will release the sulfates into the atmosphere within the next year.

The stated purpose for this massive release of toxic sulfate particles is that doing so will allegedly reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere, and thus cool the planet. But many environmental groups and advocates of common sense are decrying the idea as dangerous, and one that could result in permanent damage to ecosystems all across the globe.

“Impacts include the potential for further damage to the ozone layer, and disruption of rainfall, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, potentially threatening the food supplies of billions of people,” said Pat Mooney, Executive Director of the ETC Group, a Canadian environmental protection group.

“It will do nothing to decrease levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere or halt ocean acidification. And solar geo-engineering is likely to increase the risk of climate-related international conflict, given that the modeling to date shows it poses greater risks to the global south.”

But the Gates-backed cohort is persistent in its efforts to geo-graffiti the world, as its scientists insist that governments are not doing enough to fight back against the supposed environment impacts of global warming. If governments refuse to implement high enough carbon taxes to eliminate greenhouse gases, in other words, then Gates and Co. believes it has no choice but to “save the planet” by polluting it with sulfate particles.

Sulfate particles are toxic, though, and constitute the very same type of ambient particulate matter (PM) that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be a noxious air pollutant. Deliberately spraying the skies with tiny particles composed of any material, for that matter, is hazardous both to respiratory health in humans and animals, as well as to water sources, soils, and other delicate environmental resources.

“Sulfate particles from acid rain can cause harm to the health of marine life in the rivers and lakes it contaminates, and can result in mortality,” says an online water pollution guide (http://www.water-pollution.org.uk/health.html). A University of Washington (UW) report also explains that sulfate particles “contribute to acid rain, cause lung irritation, and have been a main culprit in causing the haze that obscures a clear view of the Grand Canyon.”

Blocking the sun with reflective particles will also deprive humans of natural sunlight exposure, which is a primary source for naturally generating health-promoting vitamin D in the body. So once again, Bill Gates is at the helms of a project that seeks to control the climate in artificial ways using toxic chemicals, an endeavor that is sure to create all sorts of potentially irreversible problems for humanity and the planet."

By no means is this an exaggeration.

According to a World Health Organization report from 2018, air pollution kills around 7 million people every year. Furthermore, numerous scientific studies have linked air pollution to heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, lung disease, and various forms of cancer.

Why Is the Air So Toxic?

There are countless sources of pollution in the air, ranging from car exhaust to industrial waste. But one of the biggest offenders is emissions from unregulated jet fuel.

Chemical and aerospace engineers have spent decades researching and developing highly efficient jet fuel. Ultimately, this has led to them adding aluminum, barium, strontium, and several other heavy metals to the fuel mixtures to help maximize efficiency and minimize cost.

While many of these heavy metal additives work wonders for fuel efficiency and cost improvement, scientists and government institutions have turned a blind eye to their severe impact on human health.

For example, aluminum exposure can lead to birth defects, neurodegenerative disease, several forms of cancer, bone disorders, and autoimmune disease.

Similarly, barium comes with a nasty list of side effects ranging from an increased risk of death from heart disease to kidney toxicity.

Despite the known dangers of heavy metals like aluminum and barium, scientists have more than doubled the concentration of these toxic additives in jet fuel since 1996.

How Exposed Are We?

In 2018, it was estimated that 102,000 flights occurred every single day, which means that significant amounts of harmful compounds are dispersed into the air through jet emissions – making every breath of air a toxic cocktail of heavy metals.

To make matters worse, many of the heavy metals used in jet fuel are added as nanoparticles – meaning the particle size is extremely small.

When heavy metals have a smaller particle size, this means they have a much easier time getting into your body and your bloodstream. With every contaminated breath we take, heavy metal nanoparticles are absorbed into your body and stored within your cells.

As a result, the heavy metals that pollute the air from jet fuel are incredibly dangerous to your health.

As you are continuously exposed to heavy metals, they begin to accumulate in your cells. This accumulation makes them exponentially more dangerous over time and with continual exposure.

Since it is nearly impossible to avoid breathing jet fuel contaminated air, the only way to protect yourself is with a consistent detoxification protocol.

While it may sound complicated, it is really quite simple.

To protect yourself from the heavy metals in air pollution from jets, you need to chelate (remove) the heavy metals from your body on a regular basis.

But how do you chelate these heavy metals?

By far, the most popular strategy to detox (chelate) heavy metals is by using the mineral zeolite. When ingested, zeolite binds to heavy metals like a magnet and then escorts them out of the body.

It is important to choose a zeolite detox supplement that is sized and cleaned properly.

Jet fuel contains high levels of toxic heavy metals like aluminum and barium. With over 102,000 worldwide daily flights, this means vast amounts of heavy metals are being dumped into the air every day. To put it plainly, every human being on this planet is unknowingly being poisoned by air pollution.

Despite the known dangers of heavy metals, government institutions and scientists alike are turning a blind eye to this glaring public health threat.

The only option to help protect your body from jet fuel emissions is to detox (chelate) your body of heavy metals using a well-formulated zeolite detox supplement.

First Comment by Thom Beecham :



I sent you an email last week about what Paul Craig Roberts said. What this ordeal is trying to show to the people is that the US constitutional republic needs to be modified to an executive type of set up, where the President has all the power. This situation is being positioned in the media as an example of our obsolete form of government.



He mentioned that if problems persist, the President would invoke the 14th Amendment, and take the power away from Congress. I think Obama's tough stance was a reflection of his ultimate desire to invoke this power, and the Republicans will have to fold, unless they want to see this occur.



Of course, the globalists are behind the agenda to undermine the US Constitution and the Republican form of government. In order for world government to be created, the Executive branch must have unilateral power. By then Congress must be rendered superfluous, like a human appendix. Getting bills through Congress can be like herding cats, and create problems. the Supreme Court has already been neutered and is just a rubber stamp of the President."

(NaturalNews) A 68-year-old UK grandmother named Eleanor Carruthers has died from the swine flu. Importantly, she was given the swine flu vaccine shot several months ago and was told the shot would offer her absolute protection from the flu.

Her daughter, Carole, was quoted in a Dailymail article saying, “‘What we don’t understand is that mum had the vaccine in October, because she was in an at risk group.”

Carol goes on to explain how doctors assured her the vaccine would offer her mom bulletproof protection against the flu: “I had been ill at New Year, and asked the doctors whether I should keep away from mum, but they said the vaccine would protect her from flu.” (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/a…)

What Carole was not told, of course, is that she was lied to about the flu vaccine. Flu vaccines are not 100% effective at protecting people from the flu. They’re not even 50% effective. In fact, a critical analysis of available data reveals that the flu vaccine is effective in only 1 out of 100 people. (http://www.naturalnews.com/029641_v…)

Carole was also not told that doctors lie about the effectiveness of flu vaccines and make outrageous claims of protection which are entirely unsubstantiated by the scientific data. This exaggeration of the benefits of flu vaccines is also repeated through advertising and promotional literature, much of which implies a “100% protection” promise for flu vaccines — even though such a claim is actually fraudulent.

The NHS flat-out lies to the public, claiming flu vaccines offer 70 to 80 percent effectiveness. This lie, of course, is critical for the ongoing acceptance of flu vaccines by the public. If any other product was marketed with the same level of deception, regulatory authorities would seek criminal punishment for those responsible. But in the realm of flu vaccines, lies are openly tolerated by regulators in order to push the vaccine agenda.

NaturalNews has long warned people that receiving a flu vaccine shot actually causes an increase in the risk of contracting the flu. Furthermore, most of the people who contract the flu in any given year are the same people who routinely get vaccinated!

Meanwhile, the real solution for flu protection — nutrition — is entirely dismissed by health authorities. They refuse to tell people that vitamin D offers highly effective protection against the flu, especially when strengthened by other immune-boosting nutrients such as zinc (http://www.naturalnews.com/027385_V…).

The dirty little secret of the flu vaccine industry

The flu “re-infection rate” for people who were already vaccinated against the flu is intentionally not reported by flu vaccine makers, governments or health professionals because if this number were reported, the flu vaccine fraud would be obvious to everyone, and flu vaccine purchases would plummet. In order to prevent this information from getting out, governments and health care providers all agree to pretend the flu vaccine really works, even while ignoring the deaths of innocent vaccine victims such as Eleanor Carruthers.

It’s a classic “The Emperor Has No Clothes” fairy tale, and all the doctors, WHO authorities and government bureaucrats all pretend they can see the Emperor’s fine clothes even though he’s actually walking around in his underwear.

In the UK, various strains of influenza have killed 112 people in the last four months. It is not known how many of those 112 people were vaccinated. That statistic, it seems, will never be released by health authorities.

It is the “dirty little secret” of the flu vaccine industry — an industry based entirely on medical quackery and marketing fraud.

The UK Police said the death was reported by a man who claims he was also abused by the group.

 The officers working with Operation Fairbank, which examines claims about a pedophile ring with links to government, became aware of allegations concerning “serious non-recent sexual abuse”, which is said to have occurred more than three decades ago, a Scotland Yard spokesman said.

 “Our inquiries into this over subsequent weeks have revealed further information regarding possible homicide. Based on our current knowledge, this is the first time that this specific information has been passed to the Met (metropolitan police),” he said

 “At this early stage in this inquiry, with much work still to do, it is not appropriate to issue appeals or reveal more information,” the spokesman added.

 The claims are being investigated under the codename Operation Midland.

 “We will not comment upon speculation as to the identity of any person or locations that may or may not feature in this inquiry,” the spokesman said.

 The prevalence of sexual harassment at Westminster came under intense scrutiny last year after it was revealed that senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard had exploited his former position as chief executive to abuse women.

"" The MMR vaccination rate in the city of Yokohama declined signiﬁcantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1992, and not a single vaccination was administered in 1993 or thereafter. In contrast, cumulative incidence of ASD up to age seven increased signiﬁcantly in the birth cohorts of years 1988 through 1996 and most notably rose dramatically beginning with the birth cohort of 1993 ""





 The authors wrongly claimed this meant it was unlikely MMR vaccine caused autism spectrum disorders. However, what the authors failed to do and what any scientist would have done would have been to ask ""why?"" . Why did autism rapidly increase for children born in 1993-94? The authors were duty bound to consider this before going into print. This is particularly notable because their data shows they were clearly on notice that withdrawing the dangerous Japanese MMR vaccine was associated with a marked drop in new cases of autism. Anyone can see that from their graphs. Autism cases fell for those born in 1991-92 as uptake of the Japanese MMR vaccine fell and was withdrawn in 1992.

 

 What the authors failed to do was to look to a peer refereed paper published only three years earlier in 2002 which set out the Japanese vaccination data: Development of Vaccination Policy in Japan: Current Issues and Policy Directions, Hiroki Nakatani,Tadashi Sanoand Tsutomu Iuchi Jpn J Infect Dis 55 101-111 2002. That paper showed that in 1995 there was a sharp rise (150%) in single measles and single rubella vaccinations. Many of the children getting those vaccines in 1995 would have been those born in 1993-4. This rise was also coupled with a sharp rise in Japanese Encephalitis vaccinations (200%) between 1993 and 1995. Japanese Encephalitis vaccine was given in three separate vaccinations and each one contained the poisonous mercury based neurotoxin thiomersal. So JE vaccine is just like DTP given to children in the USA and UK up until very recently in that it contained that neurotoxin and was given in three jabs to infants or toddlers.

For example, Kirby contends, “The Interest rate derivative trade means the U.S. Treasury can make banks captive buyers of any amount of U.S. government debt it wants to issue–literally any amount.” Kirby goes on to say, “The reality about interest rates is they are at zero and they are not going up.”

Kirby says the financial markets are not the only thing controlled; so is the current global chaos. Kirby explains, “The chaos is planned because the architects of the chaos are the globalists. The globalists have a little saying: ‘out of chaos will come order.’ So, what they do is whip up animosity and fear and play groups off of one another. . . . The goal of the globalist, ultimately, is to have one world government, one world currency and one world religion. The whole idea of globalism is to first round countries into regional blocks and then merge the blocks into one super country. These people have contempt for humanity, and they have stated their contempt for humanity. They want to reduce the world population by something of a factor of 80-90%. These globalists have taken control of the U.S., Canada, most of Western Europe and the United Kingdom. These people are dangerous, and these people are seemingly taking the work to the brink.”

On the current flood of illegal immigration on the Southern border of the United States, Kirby says, “This makes the war on terror out for what it really is, which is a ruse. I call it prisoner training, and it is indoctrinating people to accept an increasingly over-burdening police state, which is what the United States has become. The current leader in the White House is an aider and abettor of the globalist cause. Kirby goes on to say, “Under the U.N., they want to disarm Americans. Look at the major genocides of the last 100 years. They always disarm before they went on their genocide. Hitler disarmed people before he let loose on the population.”

The U.S. economy is smoke and mirrors, and Kirby points out, “America’s reported growth, reported employment and reported inflation rates are all fiction. With all the dollars that have been created, at some point, those dollars will come home. Ultimately, in the end, that will lead to the destruction of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is on a trajectory to implode, and it will implode. I can’t tell you when it will implode, but the outcome is absolutely guaranteed. The U.S. dollar will achieve its true value, which is zero. The procedures are in place to make that happen, and that’s why I am a big proponent of owning precious metal. I believe I am going to live to see the U.S. dollar worth nothing.”

Some people think buying U.S. Treasuries is a so-called “flight to quality,” but Kirby says, “U.S. Treasuries are not a flight to quality because debt is not quality, especially when you are talking about debt of an institution that, for all intent and purpose, is insolvent and can’t pay their bills. This is why physical precious metals will win the day. Physical precious metals have been around 6,000 years, which is probably around 5,800 years longer than the dollar has been around, and it’s never gone to zero. Every fiat currency has gone to zero.”

On the price of gold and why it is not taking off with all the global chaos, Kirby says, “If we had free markets, gold would be going up in spades. We effectively have a goon squad that comes in and clobbers the price of gold with paper contracts. They will dump tons and tons of paper contracts on the market, and there is no gold to back those contracts up.” Kirby also says physical gold, and especially silver supplies, are “tight.” Kirby contends, “I would say the issue in silver is more extreme than gold.” Kirby predicts, “In the next three months, we could see some extremely significant advances in the prices of both gold and silver, and I think there is a very, very, very good chance that’s exactly what we are going to see.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden promised to give a pathway to citizenship to 11 million illegal aliens during his campaign rally on Super Tuesday.

Biden, who confused his sister with his wife, then promised to find cures for Alzheimer’s disease and cancer if he was elected president.

He then went on to describe “climate change” as an “existential threat” to humanity before vowing to offer citizenship to illegal aliens.

Biden, who made his entire statement from a teleprompter, linked illegal aliens with first responders, teachers, construction, and manufacturing workers.

“These are the people that build our bridges, repair our roads, keep our water safe, who teach our kids, look who race into burning buildings to protect other people, who grow our food, build our cars, pick up our garbage, our streets,” said Biden.

“Veterans, DREAMers, single moms, and by the way, every DREAMer, have hope because I’m coming, and you’re not going anywhere,"" he added.

""We’re going to provide a pathway, a pathway for 11 million citizens.”

Biden also made a point to stress his winning of delegates from both Vermont and Massachusetts, giving they are Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren's home states.

CNN wrote that Biden had pulled off the most significant, fastest, and most unexpected comeback in modern political history following his Super Tuesday win.

""We have seen, in that 72-hour period, Joe Biden go from being a joke to a juggernaut,"" CNN commentator Van Jones claimed.

Last year, Biden vowed to give taxpayer-funded ""free"" health care to every illegal alien living in the United States of America.

The former Vice President pledged to give Obamacare, funded by American taxpayers, to all illegal immigrants in the US, estimated to be 11 to 22 million people.

Although illegal aliens are still able to obtain subsidized and free health care at Americans’ expense, Biden forgot that Obamacare technically bans illegals from enrolling in health care plans.

The Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey revealed that the healthcare-for-illegal-aliens plan is the least popular policy position, with opposition from 62 percent of U.S. voters.

So you are curious whether you have coronavirus?

You could take a coronavirus test to find out. Well, not really find out, since the test results are not reliable. Nonetheless, you can take a test to obtain at least a Magic 8 Ball level answer of if you are or are not infected with coronavirus.

Here is some information likely unknown to many people when they are tested: The names and addresses of people who test positive are often handed over to police departments that can input or tag those names and addresses in police databases.

Kimberlee Kruesi provides the details in a Tuesday Associated Press article. She starts off her article with the following revelation:

More than 11 million people have been tested in the U.S. for COVID-19, all with the assurance that their private medical information would remain protected and undisclosed. Yet, public officials in at least two-thirds of states are sharing the addresses of people who tested positive with first responders — from police officers to firefighters to EMTs. An Associated Press review found that at least 10 of those states also share the patients’ names.

Kinda makes those coronavirus tests that many government officials and people in the media have been promoting seem less warm and fuzzy, doesn’t it?

This project is called the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment and if you haven’t already looked into it, you should.

SCoPEx has been partially funded by Bill Gates and will be spending about three million dollars testing models through the years as they have been working towards a solution for several years now. In 2018 plans were noted as expected to be ready by 2019, and we are now finally getting updates in regards. As far as their tests go they intend to launch a steerable balloon into the southwest US and from there allow it to release small particles of something known as calcium carbonate.

This balloon would be observing how these particles dispersed and allow researchers to make adjustments moving forward. This basically is what many would consider a solar geoengineering experiment of sorts. Back in July of this year (2019) Nature reported that this whole ordeal was beginning to fall into place as researchers were able to create an ‘external advisory panel.’ This panel being something that would examine the potential ethical and environmental impacts of this project before moving forth.

Nature reported as follows on the topic:

Louise Bedsworth, executive director of the California Strategic Growth Council, a state agency that promotes sustainability and economic prosperity, will lead the Harvard advisory panel, the university said on 29 July. The other seven members include Earth-science researchers and specialists in environmental and climate law and policy.

Harvard said in 2017 that it would create a panel of external experts to oversee SCoPEX in response to concerns from scientists and environmentalists that geoengineering could change weather patterns or harm crops.

SCoPEx scientists, led by atmospheric chemist Frank Keutsch and physicist David Keith, hope to release small plumes of about 100 grams of calcium carbonate into the upper atmosphere and then study how the particles disperse. The scientists will also watch for changes in atmospheric chemistry and how light scatters.

The SCoPEx team said last year that the project could be ready to launch as early as the first half of 2019 if an advisory panel were in place and ready with recommendations. But Keith declined to speculate on how soon the experiment might fly now that Harvard has created the panel.

While right now we do not know the risks be it negative or perhaps positive but in time things will be more understandable for all of us. While spraying these particles into the air sounds like a bad idea, could it help us in the long-run? Perhaps weighing things out is well worth it? According to Forbes, the most recent IPCC report says that if things like this become common we could offset at least 1.5 degrees C of warming for about 1-10 billion dollars per year.

Forbes noted as follows in regards to this whole ordeal:

When comparing these costs with the global reduction in fossil fuel use or carbon sequestration, the method becomes very attractive. Thus, scientists, government agencies and independent funders of this technology must balance the inexpensive and effectiveness of this method with the potential risks to global crops, weather conditions, and drought. Ultimately, the only way to fully characterize the risks is to conduct real-world experiments, just as the Harvard team is embarking upon.

What do you think about all of this? Do you think it should happen or that we should stop playing with the idea in general? We have got to do something, could this be our best bet?"

But former FBI investigators say their old boss didn’t feel the same concern when they uncovered multiple, systemic efforts by the Saudi government to assist the hijackers in the lead-up to the 9/11 attacks — a far more consequential, to say nothing of deadly, foreign influence operation on America.

As the head of the FBI at the time, they say Mueller was not nearly as interested in investigating that espionage conspiracy, which also involved foreign intelligence officers. Far from it, the record shows he covered up evidence pointing back to the Saudi Embassy and Riyadh — and may have even misled Congress about what he knew.

9/11 victims agree. “He was the master when it came to covering up the kingdom’s role in 9/11,” said survivor Sharon Premoli, who was pulled from the rubble of the World Trade Center 18 years ago.

“In October of 2001, Mueller shut down the government’s investigation after only three weeks, and then took part in the Bush administration’s campaign to block, obfuscate and generally stop anything about Saudi Arabia from being released,” added Premoli, now a plaintiff in the 9/11 lawsuit against Saudi Arabia.

In fact, Mueller threw up roadblocks in the path of his own investigators working the 9/11 case, while making it easier for Saudi suspects to escape questioning, multiple case agents told me. Then he deep-sixed what evidence his agents did manage to uncover, according to the 9/11 lawsuit against the Saudis.
• Time and again, agents were called off from pursuing leads back to the kingdom’s embassy in Washington, as well as its consulate in Los Angeles, where former FBI Agent Stephen Moore headed a 9/11 task force looking into local contacts made by two of the 15 Saudi hijackers, Moore testified in an affidavit for the 9/11 lawsuit. He concluded that “diplomatic and intelligence personnel of Saudi Arabia knowingly provided material support to the two hijackers and facilitated the 9/11 plot.” Yet he and his team were not allowed to interview them, according to the suit.
• In Washington, former FBI Agent John Guandolo, who worked terror cases out of the bureau’s DC office, said then-Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar “should have been treated as a terrorist suspect” for giving money to a woman who funded two of the 9/11 hijackers. But he was never questioned either, Guandolo said.
• Instead, Mueller obliged what Guandolo called an “outrageous request” from Bandar within days of the attacks to help evacuate from the country dozens of Saudi officials, including at least one Osama bin Laden relative on the terror watch list. Mueller assured their safe passage to planes, using agents as personal escorts, according to FBI documents obtained by Judicial Watch. Agents who should have been interrogating the Saudis instead acted as their bodyguards.
• In 2002, Mueller prevented agents from arresting the Saudi-sponsored al Qaeda cleric who privately counseled the Saudi hijackers, said Raymond Fournier, an agent with the Joint Terrorism Task Force in San Diego at the time. “He was responsible for vacating the arrest warrant for Anwar al-Awlaki for passport fraud,” Fournier said. He even ordered agents who detained the fiend at JFK to release him into the custody of a “Saudi representative,” Fournier said. The FBI closed their investigation of Awlaki, who was allowed to leave the US on a Saudi plane. “Shortly thereafter, the Fort Hood shooting occurred and Awlaki’s fingerprints were all over that incident,” said former FBI Agent Michael Biasello, who helped work the Texas terror case.
• At the same time, Mueller removed a veteran agent from investigating a tip that an adviser to the Saudi royal family had met with some of the Saudi hijackers at his home in Sarasota, Fla., effectively killing the case, according to the lawsuit. The home was suddenly abandoned two weeks before 9/11.
• Mueller even tried to shut down a congressional investigation into the Saudi hijackers and their contacts in LA and San Diego, said Bob Graham, who led the joint inquiry as Senate Intelligence Committee chair. “The strongest objections” to his staff investigators visiting FBI offices there came from the FBI director himself, said Graham, in a 2017 interview with Harper’s magazine. Among other things, Mueller refused their demands to question a paid FBI informant who roomed with the hijackers and even moved him to a safe house where they couldn’t find him, Graham said. Mueller, with the White House, redacted 28 pages detailing Saudi-9/11 ties from the congressional report.
• He also gave testimony to Congress that was, at the very least, misleading. In an October 2002 closed-door hearing, Mueller claimed he found out about Saudi-9/11 connections only as a result of the joint inquiry’s investigative work: “[S]ome facts came to light here and to me, frankly, that had not come to light before.” Only, Moore said he gave Mueller “daily” briefings on such connections in 2001. Mueller also testified the hijackers “contacted no known terrorist sympathizers in the United States,” even though the FBI’s own case files showed they had contact with at least 14 terrorist suspects and sympathizers in the US prior to 9/11, including some working for the Saudi government. (In later testimony, he tried to walk this back, insisting he “had no intent to mislead.”)"

And she did this while giving a “eulogy” at Elijah Cummings funeral! How often have we seen the Clintons using a funeral as a political springboard for their personal advantage? When Bill used to do that, they called it “sucking all the air out of the room.”

Let’s get some points here.
• Bill Clinton started a war in the Balkans (on the wrong side) to distract the press from his affair with his secretary.
• Both Clintons are recorded as being passengers on numerous flights to “Pedophile Island.”
• “Arkanside” and the “Arkansas Flu” are accepted parts of the language, and refer to the large number of people who have died after becoming a liability to the Clintons.
• The Clintons celebrated their honeymoon at the home of a voodoo priestess in Haiti.

We could go on an on, but you get the point.

 On the other hand:
• Donald Trump has worked for religious liberty since entering office.
• He has been steadily breaking up powerful pedophile rings in America and around the world, to rescue innocent children from sexual exploitation.
• Melania refused to move into the White House until there had been an exorcism performed in the building.
• Melania’s first words at her husband’s inauguration were to pray the “Our Father,” the most important Christian prayer.

So I ask, who are the real Ahab and Jezebel?"

Wuhan reports 5 new coronavirus cases, its highest surge in 2 MONTHS

Wuhan, China, the original hotspot of the Covid-19 pandemic, has reported five new indigenous cases as the number of infections across mainland China has grown slightly.

China reported 17 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Monday – three more than the day before. Of the newly-detected cases, seven are linked to overseas travel, and 10 are believed to be the result of local transmission.

In addition to five indigenous cases in Wuhan, three others came from Jilin province, one from Liaoning, which borders North Korea, and another from Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia.

While these figures might not sound so alarming considering that China was registering thousands of cases per day in February during the peak, it still marks the nation’s biggest jump in confirmed infections since April 28.

The latest data from Wuhan, which just last month celebrated the recovery of the last patient with severe Covid-19, can also be seen as a worrying sign since it is the most significant increase in cases for the pandemic ground zero in two months.

The last time Wuhan reported more than five new cases in a single day (eight) was on March 11.

However, it was not until early April that the last remaining travel restrictions imposed on the city when it was fighting the outbreak were lifted after 76 days of lockdown. Around the same time, Wuhan for the first time reported zero daily deaths from the disease.

Considering the steady drop in the number of new patients, Beijing has gradually relaxed coronavirus measures across the country, on Thursday declaring all of China to be ‘low risk’ in terms of coronavirus.

Apart from Hubei, there has been a surge in infections in Shulan in the northeastern Jilin province, where all of the new cases are believed to be traced to a single woman. Concerned about a possible second wave of the disease, local authorities raised the risk level from low to medium last week.

From the onset of the pandemic, China has reported a total of 82,918 cases, including 4,633 fatalities.

They also privately mocked claims about Iraq’s nuclear programme, joking that atomic specialists the document suggested had been assembled in Iraq must be ‘Dr Frankenstein’.

The 2002 dossier, which helped convince many MPs of the case for war, contained the now-discredited claim that Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons which could be deployed within 45 minutes.

An inquiry headed by Lord Hutton, widely seen as a whitewash, concluded that spy chief Sir John Scarlett, who compiled the document, could have been ‘subconsciously influenced’ by political pressure while drawing up the report.

What I’m calling the “death science trifecta” consists of the coronavirus (biological weapons), 5G towers (electromagnetic weapons) and vaccines (chemical weapons). In combination, they are designed to enslave and then exterminate most human beings living today.

That’s why there’s no real talk of restoring human freedom, or promoting pro-human free speech or even allowing anyone to advocate nutrition that can save lives. The globalists have zero interest in saving humanity… they are working to exterminate billions of human beings. And bioweapons, 5G and vaccines are the trifecta of mass death and tyranny that they’re using to accomplish their goal.

I’ve put this into a must-see infographic shown below. It’s no accident the graphic is organized like the all-seeing eye and pyramid on the back of the US dollar. This is the structure of power over humanity that has been invoked by anti-human globalists for centuries.

Take a look at the graphic here, and share everywhere, along with a warning. If humanity doesn’t rise up against our oppressors, we will be exterminated.

To hear my full lecture on the death science trifecta, register at GenSix.com for the upcoming conference on May 15-16th. I’m presenting a nearly three-hour lecture on all this, detailing the real threats against humanity and how a small number of informed human beings may survive the extermination attempt.

As you can see from the infographic above, depopulation is the end game of all this. Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Science are all colluding to obliterate the human population on our planet. They are in, fact, preparing Earth for a post-human era.

How extreme, anomalous, and unnatural was the divide between extreme cold and record heat in the US on Sunday? The map below shows a shocking scenario.

The increasingly extreme temperature swings are wreaking havoc on all life forms.

Skies all over the globe are being sprayed with highly toxic aerosols that are a core component of the climate intervention operations (these are NOT condensation trails). In the forecast model below, warm flows of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico are chemically ice nucleated by the geoengineers. This process creates the short term chemical cool-downs that have now become the norm.

The bullseye of impact from ""Winter Storm Europa"" was yet again directed toward the Dakotas.

Ice storms are now almost always seen in the transition zones between warm flows of moisture (used as fuel for the engineered winter weather events) and the core of the chemically ice nucleated zones.

The Dakota Water Protectors have been consistently and severely impacted by extreme ""winter weather"". This has occurred even after the US experienced its warmest autumn ever recorded. Is this also just a coincidence? The video animation below has captured the chemical ice nucleation process being carried out by the climate engineers. Warm (far above freezing) flows of moisture can clearly be seen ""flashing out"" to snow for no apparent reason (meteorologically speaking). The power structure paid disinformation sources like ""The Weather Channel"" have now called this process ""changing over to snow"". Official sources of weather forecasting and information are simply covering the tracks of the climate engineers as they have been paid to do. The radar loop shown below is undeniable proof of ""chemical ice nucleation for weather modification"".

Chemical ice nucleation of the warm flow of moisture from the south is clearly visible in the radar animation above. A close examination also reveals radio frequency transmission manipulation with an epicenter located in Rapid City. Why don't we have whistleblowers sounding the alarm on the climate engineering insanity? The illegal federal gag order on all National Weather Service and all National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration employees is certainly a major factor.

In the map below, major ice storm impacts (mentioned earlier) are seen in the transition zone where the warm flow of moisture from the south is being chemically nucleated.

As mentioned earlier, disinformation sources (like The Weather Channel) are doing their best to convince populations that is is now normal to have a ""warm side"" and a ""cold side"" to a ""winter storm"".

The storm severity map below clearly shows the epicenter of the extreme weather from ""WInter Storm Europa"" is directly on top of the Dakota Water Protector protest zone.

The red zones in the map above reveal the most severe impact zones of ""Winter Storm Europa"".

What is worth noting in the next map (shown below) are the extremely warm temperatures that exist in the flows of moisture that continue to feed ""Winter Storm Europa"". As this flow of moisture migrates to the North East, temperatures of over 60 degrees are visible only a short distance from the chemically cooled ice nucleation zones. We now almost never hear the power structure paid ""weather forecasters"" referring to snow levels based on elevations. Now, thanks to climate engineering, you are either on the warm side of the storm or the cold side of the storm. Elevation is now generally no longer a factor.

Scenarios like the one shown in the map above are historically unprecedented. Now such scenarios are considered the norm.

The completely out of control climate engineering cabal continues to try and cover up the rapidly worsening planetary meltdown with more and more ""engineered winter"" short term toxic cool-downs. The paradox is this, every climate intervention that the climate engineers carry out makes the overall warming of the planet worse, not better. The Geoengineers are destroying the ozone layer, disrupting the hydrological cycle, fueling forest fires, and contaminating the entire planet in the process. 2016 will be the third record shattering hot year in a row and this record will occur in spite of the fact that ""official"" agencies are UNDERREPORTING high temperatures, not exaggerating them.

The meltdown of the polar region is of especially grave concern. The bright red zones at the top of this Temperature Anomaly map clearly reveals the ongoing Arctic meltdown. Massive formerly frozen methane deposits are now rapidly thawing and releasing. These methane releases may soon determine our collective fate, climate intervention programs are making the methane releases worse overall, not better.

We must all work together in the most critical effort to expose and halt the climate engineering insanity. Those that have chosen to deny or hide from reality must realize that their denial will not stop what is coming. Join the fight to expose and halt the climate engineering planetary omnicide, help us in the battle to sound the alarm.

I was watching an anchor on MSNBC ask a guest why the “recovery” is so uneven and why it was hard to maintain upward momentum? I yelled out to my TV, “Because there is no recovery!” The “recovery” story is talked about as fact, no matter what the facts really are.” For example, a story on housing just last week from the Wall Street Journal said, “Bank repossessions hit a record monthly high for the second month in a row, totaling 93,777–up 1% from April and 44% from last year.” (Click here for the complete story from WSJ.) Bank repos up 44% in a year! Why are “record” home repossessions not included in the “recovery”discussion? Maybe because it wouldn’t sound like a “recovery” after all?

Here is another “recovery” buster from yesterday’s Washington Post. It says the President, “. . .urged reluctant lawmakers Saturday to quickly approve nearly $50 billion in emergency aid to state and local governments, saying the money is needed to avoid “massive layoffs of teachers, police and firefighters” and to support the still-fragile economic recovery.” (Click here for the complete Post article.) “Emergency aid” sounds like a crisis and definitely not a “recovery” to me.

In the most recent report from Shadowstats.com (out last Friday), John Williams is, once again, forecasting a big dive coming in the economy. Williams says, “I would describe the shape of this recession/depression as one tracing out the path of an inept skier trying out a ski jump: sharp decline, then some leveling out with a brief up-blip, followed by a renewed plunge with the potential for an unexpectedly disastrous landing.”

I think many politicians know the economy is really not very good. They might say the economy is recovering publicly, but privately they know it’s in the tank and headed deeper. I think some are hoping the Federal Reserve will wave a magic wand and painlessly make everything better. Those are the politicians who will fight a bona fide audit of the Fed. Many think an audit would spark public outrage that would put it out of business.

I also think there are growing numbers in Congress who are afraid if the Fed maintains its secret powers, it will bailout its buddies in the financial industry around the globe and leave America bankrupt. The final financial reform bill, officially know as the “Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009,” has passed two similar versions in the House and the Senate.

Now, both chambers have to get together and agree on the final language for just one bill that will be sent to the President to sign into law. The language to audit the Fed has been watered down in the Senate version. Republican Congressman Ron Paul and others are fighting to restore language that would make possible a full audit of the Federal Reserve. And get this, powerful Democratic Representative Barney Frank is supporting Paul! If Rep. Frank is for real on this and not just trying to look good to his constituents to get votes in November, then hats off to him and any member of Congress who supports a full Fed audit. I can’t believe the mainstream media is completely ignoring this monumental story. There is nothing more important, financially speaking, that Congress can pass right now. Check out the video below that came out from the floor of Congress just last week:"

Mannarino explains, “War is the goal. People need to understand here the goal of the world central banks is to bring us to war. So, they have a big, big reason to borrow cash into existence. This is it. The debt based economic model has got to be the most corrupt, evil and dastardly mechanism to be pushed down the throats of the entire world. They are going to do what they need to do and that means bring us to a full blown war, nuclear or whatever they need to do to keep this going. If they do not find the reasons to borrow cash into existence, creating refugee problems, leaving all the borders open, war, you name it. . . . The world central banks have created a situation where they have to borrow cash into existence in perpetuity. They can never stop. If they do stop, it will cause a loss of human life greater than a nuclear exchange. So, they are stuck here. The lessor of the two evils here is to bring us to war. As horrible as that sounds, that is where we’re at.”

On the surging stock market, even though the economic and geopolitical news is bad, Mannarino contends, “Forget about the stock market. It has absolutely disconnected from reality in every way, shape or form you can think about. We are now existing in economic fantasyland. The market top from May has held so far. Will it continue to hold? Here’s what I am thinking now. I do believe it has the potential to hold, but why is the market up on the shooting down of this Russian jet and helicopter? Because they are expecting the world central banks to do something. We have terror all over the world and war building up. This is going to give them an excuse to print and stimulate. That is going to have an effect on the markets, and that is why it is higher.”

On the Fed raising interest rates soon, Mannarino thinks, “The Fed is, frankly, screwed. They are going to have to do something here to remain credible. Confidence is the only thing keeping this farce going. If the Federal Reserve does not raise rates next month, then that is the biggest ‘no confidence’ vote for the U.S. economy, and that is going to melt down this market. Some think if the Federal Reserve does not raise rates, the market is going higher. I can’t imagine why it would do that. This secret meet they just had, this is what they were talking about. . . . I think the Fed was discussing the lessor of two evils here. The lessor of two evils is they are going to nudge rates higher.”

This ban was received shortly after Natural News published a rebuttal to the junk science climate change narrative which falsely claims that carbon dioxide is a poison that will destroy the planet. (Only someone who is scientifically illiterate or completely brainwashed could believe such a falsehood.)

Natural News dares to state the simple scientific fact — now confirmed by NASA — that carbon dioxide boosts the growth of green plants all across the Earth. This is not allowed by the techno-fascists of the Left who run Apple and insist that CO2 is somehow a poison that’s responsible for “climate change.”

Here’s the world map showing the increase in reforestation and greening, as cited by NASA and published the journal Nature: Climate Change:

Note that this image shows an increase in “greening” across every continent, which NASA confirms is due to rising carbon dioxide, a fertilizer for plants.

Apple Censors Disagree With Scientific Reality and Ban Anyone Who Speaks the Truth

Even though NASA has also admitted that CO2 is greening the Earth, Apple says that Natural News stories are diverging from the “scientific community,” somehow justifying Apple’s censorship of all news from Natural News, including the hundreds of articles each month that cite scientific journals.

Natural News is the internet’s most prolific publisher of science-based news covering phytonutrients, herbal medicine, nutritional therapies, holistic health therapies and the health dangers associated with vaccines, pharmaceuticals and toxic chemotherapy treatments. Apple — which of course panders to Big Pharma, Monsanto, Bayer and the vaccine industry — has now decided that any news stories which diverge from the “official narrative” must be silenced.

This is a dangerous precedent that will stifle the very process of scientific discovery which depends on the process of considering dissenting views. With no dissenting views allowed, science can never move forward. This is Apple’s new demand: that humanity stay stuck forever in whatever myths, deceptions and misconceptions “science” believed in 2019 (and there are many).

Regardless of whether an individual agrees or disagrees with Natural News content, Apple has now decided that no one is even allowed to read or view that content. In essence, Apple is now functioning as the Ministry of Truth, deciding which science-based news stories fit the accepted “consensus” narrative versus those that diverge from establishment views. In essence, Apple has declared it will enforce a scientific dictatorship which disallows all news stories, videos or views which challenge the scientific establishment.

Here’s the email that Apple News sent to Natural News:

The History of Science is Full of Examples of Wrong Ideas Which Were Corrected by Divergent Views From Pioneering Thinkers

Any intelligent, informed student of the history of science might ask the obvious question: How can science be “self-correcting” if no opposing views are allowed to be seen? The history of science is full of examples of scientists being wrong about not just small things, but really big things, too.

For example, it was once the “scientific consensus” that volcanoes were caused by angry gods. Or that the Earth was flat. It wasn’t long ago that scientists claimed thalidomide was safe for pregnant women.

Even now, the “consensus” science view that claims carbon dioxide is a “pollutant” that’s destroying the planet stands in complete contradiction of the laws of plant physiology (botany) and photosynthesis. At the same time, the bizarre new left-wing “science” that claims women and men are biologically identical and that children are born “genderless,” then “assigned” a gender at birth by the doctor is of course completely insane and contradicts biological reality.

If Apple were in charge of the world in the 16th century, no one would have ever been allowed to claim the Earth wasn’t the center of the universe, or that space was (nearly) a vacuum. The progress of all human knowledge would have been put on hold, “frozen” in the Era of Ignorance, enforced by Apple.

Of course, we are still living in a new era of ignorance, and Apple has declared that no new knowledge will be allowed to be published, shared or viewed by anyone. Yet Apple gladly publishes news from sources that claim ludicrous, impossible things like claiming that men can get pregnant and give birth — that’s the new “transgender” science quackery being routinely pushed by the left-wing cult that has overtaken modern society.

Think about it: Apple insists that “transgenderism” is real, but biology, atmospheric chemistry and botany are all declared “fake” by Apple’s left-wing censors.

We have truly entered the realm of insanity, where lies are pushed as truth, and truth is labeled treason.

If you are still getting news fed to you by Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter or any other source that’s run by left-wing lunatics, you are being brainwashed and indoctrinated by a dangerous cult that stands in completely opposition to reality and reason.

Stop reading Apple News and get off iPhones. Here are some far better news sources to check out instead:

The European Union’s new foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini on Saturday called for the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying the world “cannot afford” another war in Gaza

Hamas and Israel fought a 50-day war in July and August which resulted in the deaths of 2,140 Palestinians, at least half of them combatants according to Israel, and more than 70 Israelis, most of them soldiers.

Mogherini’s visit came against a backdrop of surging Israeli-Palestinian tensions in East Jerusalem where there have been near-daily clashes in flashpoint neighborhoods, and two terror attacks that killed four Israelis in two weeks.

She voiced hope that Gaza would avoid another major conflict. “It is not only the people of Gaza that can’t afford having a fourth war, all the world cannot afford this,” she said.

“We cannot just sit and wait. If we sit and wait it will go on for another 40 years. We have to have action now,” said Mogherini, a former Italian foreign minister who recently took over from Catherine Ashton as the top EU diplomat.

Earlier Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported that several European nations told US officials that they are seriously considering unilaterally recognizing Palestine as a state, as Sweden did last month, if peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians do not resume.

“In 2010, the tech firm ­Oracle sounded the alarm that Google copied its Java software application-program interfaces (API) for Google’s Android smartphone without a license. In the litigation that followed, a federal appellate court twice ruled for Oracle, rejecting Google’s main defense that it made “fair use” of Oracle’s code.

Google argues that API ought to not be copyrightable, because ­innovation would be ­unduly stifled. But that’s exactly backward: It is allowing conglomerates to pilfer code that would stifle innovation. Google’s definition of “fair use” is so broad, it would allow the exception to swallow the rule — which is aimed at protecting the hard work of others.”

President Donald Trump on Monday issued a two-page memo containing several “guidelines” for Americans and state leaders to follow over a period of 15 days as a way to limit the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

But for some lawmakers and White House officials, those measures fall far short of what they say is needed: A national lockdown similar to those imposed by China and European governments.

During a White House press conference Monday afternoon, Trump referenced the memo titled, “15 Days to Slow the Spread,” which officials noted was not a national lockdown order.

Rather, they contain suggestions for Americans and businesses to follow in order to reduce contact and thus help blunt the spread of the coronavirus.

“If everyone makes this change, or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus,” the president told reporters. “We’re going to have a big celebration all together.”

The president, who was no doubt quoting his health experts, added that the outbreak could last into July or August.

The administration’s new guidance advises Americans to avoid drinking and eating at bars, restaurants, and other food establishments. Trump also recommended against most social visits, including visiting nursing and retirement homes.

“My administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, avoid discretionary travel, and avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants and public food courts,” the president said.

Trump’s recommendations come a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Americans to avoid places where 50 or more people were gathered.

But the president’s recommendations did not go far enough for Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). As Breitbart News reports, he is calling for a China/Europe-style national “shutdown.”

‘Our military plans for exactly this kind of contingency’

“The time has come for extraordinary measures to combat the Chinese coronavirus. What seems extreme today will seem obvious tomorrow,” said Cotton, who has been critical of the House’s coronavirus relief measures.

Cotton premised his recommendation on the current situation in Italy, where hundreds of people are dying by the day as the virus outbreak surges there. He notes that the outbreak has led to hospitals and healthcare clinics being overwhelmed even as they ration care for older, sicker patients.

The Arkansas Republican said he thinks the U.S. can only hope to “shorten the risk to Americans’ health and the economic hardships” if the government takes drastic actions now. (Related: Secret UK health doc predicts “80%” will become afflicted with coronavirus as outbreak stretches into 2021 and kills 500,000-plus.)

That could also include issuing cash stipends to workers amid a national “shutdown” which ceases all but “essential activities.”

“Call it what you want—a shutdown, quarantine, curfew, whatever. But only absolutely essential work should continue: groceries, pharmacies, supply transport, health care, electricity, water, sanitation, etc. Everyone else should stay home,” Cotton added, according to Breitbart.

“Shut down all but essential government agencies & services. At federal, state, and local levels, officials working to arrest the virus’s spread and mitigate its economic harm (and other essential services like food aid and VA care) must continue working,” he continued. “No one else should.”

He also added that the U.S. military should also be preparing for the defense of civil authorities — a dire statement — “especially at hospitals, nursing homes, etc. & do whatever is needed to increase our capacity to treat patients.

“Our military plans for exactly this kind of contingency,” he said. “Our doctors and nurses may need them. As Dr. Anthony Fauci said yesterday, ‘we’ll be thankful that we overreacted’ if we arrest the spread of the virus, preserve hospital capacity, and save lives,” Cotton said."
775,True,The article suggests that there is a conspiracy involving the Clintons and their alleged illegal activities.,True,"The article mentions Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, and the Clinton Foundation as actors involved in the alleged crimes.",True,"The article discusses the alleged illegal activities of the Clintons, such as mishandling classified information and charity fraud.",False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,True,The article connects various events and allegations to suggest a pattern of illegal activities by the Clintons.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"Expert predicts Bill and Hillary Clinton will BOTH be convicted “BIGLY” for crimes in 2018 as their house of cards comes crashing DOWN

In just a few short weeks, former U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown will begin serving a five-year prison sentence for participating in an $800,000 charity fraud. But her conviction and sentencing will no doubt raise questions about why she is behind bars, but Hillary Clinton and, to another extent her philandering husband and ex-president, Bill Clinton, remain free.

As Lifezette has reported, that question and the fact that Clinton has yet to be charged for so very obviously (and carelessly) mishandling classified information during her tenure as Barack Obama’s Secretary of State has raised substantial, well-deserved doubts about the unequal application of justice in America. Those with less or no political influence seem to be dealt with much more harshly than those who are considered powerful.

Brown, an African-American Democrat who long represented the Jacksonville, Fla., district, was convicted last year in a case that, in terms of dollars involved, was paltry compared to the Clinton Foundation. Begun in 1997 as the former president’s library project, it morphed into a $2 billion cash cow for the former first family, in what one nonprofit expert has called “the biggest charity fraud ever.”

That expert, Charles Ortel, told Lifezette on Sunday that he believes fired FBI Director James “Comey will rat out Hillary and the Clintons faster than [Olympic runner] Usain Bolt runs the 100-meter dash.”

Further, he predicted, “Both Clintons will be convicted, bigly,” this year. (Related: PROOF that Hillary Clinton got special treatment by the FBI, which exonerated her even though she committed serious crimes.)

Ortel, a New York investment banker who became a non-profit fraud investigator, first gained national prominence in 2007 when he exposed fraudulent accounting practices at General Electric and a number of other large corporations. He also became known for warning of the then-approaching financial crisis that became known as the Great Recession of 2008.

Since 2015 Ortel has documented extensively cases involving what he sees as the Clinton Foundation’s multiple violations of laws and rules governing charities. They include, significantly, examples of the foundation operating international medical and disaster relief programs in violation of its tax-exempt status granted by the IRS.

He also believes former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, especially during her tenure as President Barack Obama’s Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, used the family foundation as a vehicle for selling their influence and becoming wealthy in the process, thanks in great part to the lack of politically independent regulation of charities soliciting funds and operating programs in multiple countries around the globe.

In his interview, Ortel said, “the sad truth is that international charities are perfect vehicles for influence-peddling, and for financial mischief, especially when they are overseen by conflicted directors/trustees, and ‘audited’ by under-resourced professional firms.”

As expected, various spokespeople for the Clinton Foundation have regularly denied that the charity has engaged in any wrongdoing. And to be sure, no charges have ever been filed against either Clinton or the foundation. That said, Ortel believes the foundation’s obvious illegal fundraising activities and operations may prove to be the house of cards that finally collapses around the former first family.

For example, he notes that the French government has been conducting a major investigation for months, while a similar probe is beginning to take shape in Sweden. The foundation received millions in donations from both governments and from private entities in both countries.

But there have been previous investigations by the Department of Justice — however, without any charges. The first was overseen by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller (sound familiar?) during George W. Bush’s administration; his then-deputy was none other than Comey.

There is supposedly a second investigation underway that began in March 2016, but so far no charges have been filed.

And the Clinton email scandal made news again last week, as legal watchdog group Judicial Watch announced that a handful of additional classified emails had been found on the laptop of former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin.

“The fact that classified information has been found from Clinton and Abedin on Weiner’s laptop shows the urgent need for a criminal investigation by the Justice Department,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

So she asked her doc what she should do. Let's not beat around the bush on this issue: The swine flu vaccines now being prepared for mass injection into infants, children, teens and adults have never been tested and won't be tested before the injections begin. In Europe, where flu vaccines are typically tested on hundreds (or thousands) of people before being unleashed on the masses, the European Medicines Agency is allowing companies to skip the testing process entirely. And yet, amazingly, people are lining up to take the vaccine, absent any safety testing whatsoever. When the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. announced a swine <http://www.naturalnews.com/flu_vaccine.html>flu vaccine trial beginning in early August, it was inundated with phone calls and emails from people desperate to play the role of human guinea pigs. The power of fear to herd sheeple into vaccine injections is simply amazing... Back in Europe, of course, everybody gets to be a guinea pig since no testing will be done on the vaccine at all. Even worse, the European <http://www.naturalnews.com/vaccines.html>vaccines will be using adjuvants -- chemicals used to multiply the potency of the active ingredients in vaccines. Notably, there is absolutely no safety data on the use of adjuvants in infants and expectant mothers -- the two groups being most aggressively targeted by the <http://www.naturalnews.com/swine_flu.html>swine flu vaccine pushers. The leads us to the disturbing conclusion that the swine flu vaccine could be a modern medical disaster. It's untested and un-tried. Its ingredients are potentially quite dangerous, and the adjuvants being used in the European vaccines are suspected of causing neurological disorders. I probably don't need to remind you that in 1976, a failed swine flu vaccine caused irreparable damage to the nervous systems of hundreds of people, paralyzing many. Medical <http://www.naturalnews.com/doctors.html>doctors gave the problem a name, of course, to make it sound like they knew what they were talking about: Guillain-Barre syndrome. (Notably, they never called it ""Toxic Vaccine Syndrome"" because that would be too informative.) But the fact remains that doctors never knew how the vaccines caused these severe problems, and if the same event played out today, all the doctors and vaccine pushers would undoubtedly deny any link between the vaccines and paralysis altogether. (That's what's happening today with the debate over vaccines and <http://www.naturalnews.com/autism.html>autism: Complete denial.) In fact, there are a whole lot of things you'll never be told by <http://www.naturalnews.com/health.html>health authorities about the upcoming swine flu vaccine. For your amusement, I've written down the ten most obvious ones and published them below. Ten things you're not supposed to know about the swine flu vaccine #1 - The vaccine production was ""rushed"" and the vaccine has never been tested on humans. Do you like to play guinea pig for <http://www.naturalnews.com/Big_Pharma.html>Big Pharma? If so, line up for your swine flu vaccine this fall... #2 - Swine <http://www.naturalnews.com/flu_vaccines.html>flu vaccines contain dangerous adjuvants that cause an inflammatory response in the body. This is why they are suspected of causing autism and other neurological disorders. #3 - The swine flu vaccine could actually increase your risk of death from swine flu by altering (or suppressing) your immune system response. There is zero evidence that even seasonal flu shots offer any meaningful protection for people who take the jabs. Vaccines are the snake oil of modern medicine. #4 - Doctors still don't know why the 1976 swine flu vaccines paralyzed so many people. And that means they really have no clue whether the upcoming vaccine might cause the same devastating side effects. (And they're not testing it, either...) #5 - Even if the swine flu vaccine kills you, the <http://www.naturalnews.com/drug_companies.html>drug companies aren't responsible. The U.S. government has granted drug companies complete immunity against vaccine product liability. Thanks to that blanket immunity, drug companies have no incentive to make safe vaccines, because they only get paid based on quantity, not safety (zero liability). #6 - No swine flu vaccine works as well as vitamin D to protect you from influenza. That's an inconvenient scientific fact that the U.S. government, the FDA and Big Pharma hope the people never realize. #7 - Even if the swine flu vaccine actually works, mathematically speaking if everyone else around you gets the vaccine, you don't need one! (Because it can't spread through the population you hang with.) So even if you believe in the vaccine, all you need to do is encourage your friends to go get vaccinated... #8 - Drug companies are making billions of dollars from the production of swine flu vaccines. That money comes out of your pocket -- even if you don't get the jab -- because it's all paid by the taxpayers. #9 - When people start dying in larger numbers from the swine flu, rest assured that many of them will be the very people who got the swine flu vaccine. Doctors will explain this away with their typical Big Pharma logic: ""The number saved is far greater than the number lost."" Of course, the number ""saved"" is entirely fictional... imaginary... and exists only in their own warped heads. #10 - The swine flu vaccine centers that will crop up all over the world in the coming months aren't completely useless: They will provide an easy way to identify large groups of really stupid people. (Too bad there isn't some sort of blue dye that we could tag 'em with for future reference...) The lottery, they say, is a tax on people who can't do math. Similarly, flu vaccines are a tax on people who don't understand health."

It also mentions that there is a coordinated effort to push vaccines without adequate testing or safety data.","Bernadette Pajer of Informed Choice Washington gave an impassioned speech to the WA Board of Health regarding a terrifying vaccine industry initiative:

A large and highly organized network involving public health groups and big pharma wish to force vaccines on every adult and an immunization schedule on every child.

The vaccine industry is working hard (behind closed doors) to vaccinate as many people as possible. Sadly, the right to refuse vaccinations is viewed as an ‘obstacle’ by the pharmaceutical industry and conventional medicine.

But, Bernadette Pajer reveals the true nature of big pharma and vaccine policy makers – which will shock most uninformed people.

Advocacy groups met with silence when trying to discuss vaccine side effects and vaccine dangers

The immunization program heads are pushing this agenda with full the collaboration and support of big drug companies like Merck, Pfizer, Glaxo Smith Kline and many others.

Pajer shared that Informed Choice Washington has been trying to get the word out about vaccine side effects as well as immune system problems to the public health agencies of Washington state. The goal of the group is to foster discussion and better conditions for consumers of all ages.

Instead of openness and cooperation, she was astonished to find a tightly organized, unreceptive network with literally thousands of components working toward one goal: to increase vaccination uptake at any cost.

Washington Board of Health is one of many groups downplaying unwanted vaccine side effects

She notes that since 1999, the Association for Immunization Managers (AIM) has been working closely with the pharmaceutical industry toward this goal. She laments that the efforts of her group and others like it to work with these agencies on education and improvement are either met with disdain or completely ignored.

Instead, programs are in place and conferences held to further the agenda of getting the highest numbers of vaccine acceptance possible. There are even seminars given to medical professionals on how to handle “vaccine hesitancy” and “compel” patients (and parents) to accept vaccines – even if their misgivings are valid.

She is alarmed at the coordinated effort of these groups – and you should be, too.

The list of vaccine side effects is long and well-documented. They include autism, cognitive problems, compromised immunity, chronic headaches plus many other issues.

Vaccine adjuvants like aluminum, chromium and mercury are known neurotoxins that are doing underreported damage to the brain – especially in young and developing children.

Also, despite widespread vaccine use, incidents of many diseases are actually higher. Cancer rates and infectious diseases are still a major concern – despite the widespread use of vaccines.

With so many vaccine dangers, it is beyond alarming that there is a highly organized network in place with the agenda of pushing vaccines – without adequate testing or safety data.

Bernadette Pajer should be applauded for speaking out, and hopefully her example will inspire many others to do the same."

Erica Anderson, Partnerships Manager at Google News Lab, announced that the company will partner with the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at the Poynter Institute to “fact-check” news stories that appear on the search engine.

“With so much information available around the clock and across devices, being able to understand at a glance what’s true and what’s false online is increasingly important,” Anderson said in a statement.

She said Google will work with the IFCN in three ways: increase the number of fact-checkers by holding “global fact-check workshops” and offering stipends for new fact-checking organizations; expanding the IFCN Code of Principles into new regions; and providing fact-checking tools to the IFCN community at no charge.

The code of principles requires news agencies to obey five commitments to ensure news agencies remain honest, transparent and nonpartisan. There are 36 signatories to the Code of Principles, including the left-leaning Washington Post Fact Checker and other fact-checking organizations from around the world.

Alexios Mantzarlis, the director of the IFCN at Poynter released a statement, saying the 12-month partnership will “enable the IFCN to encourage more fact-checking around the world, while also helping raise the standards and impact of existing initiatives.”

The Poynter Institute for Media Studies is openly funded by Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Soros, a veteran billionaire vulture capitalist, supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.

Soros was recently criticised for transferring nearly $18 billion to his Open Society Foundations, making it the second largest charity in the US after the Bill and Melinda Gates’ Foundation. The charity has been accused of inciting so-called “color revolutions” to install governments friendly to the US.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said through a statement that certain Soros funded organizations “defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself.”

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban also accused Soros of using his money to fund liberal NGOs influencing the European Union to accept asylum seekers in order to create a “new, mixed, Muslimized Europe.”

The Poynter Institute also receives funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy and the Omidyar Network, which is the nonprofit for liberal billionaire and eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar.

The Google-Poynter partnership was announced days before executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter are scheduled to testify before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Facebook, which has come under scrutiny for their part in spreading false news stories during the election, has also partnered with the Poynter Institute to launch its “disputed” news tag on stories deemed false by fact-checking organisations working with the social media giant.

Stories flagged by Facebook users as ‘fake news’ are passed on to these fact-checkers for verification. If the fact-checkers agree that the story is misleading, it will appear in news feeds with a “disputed” tag, along with a link to a corresponding article explaining why it might be false.

Google News Lab previously partnered with The Poynter Institute to introduce a “Fact Check tag” that labels news articles the company determines might contain fact-checks in order to “help readers find fact-checking in large news stories.”"

We’ve been promised that there are white hats taking down the cabal – the shadow government that even six former presidents have referenced – but is it really true? Here are some of the pieces of the puzzle which suggest that the shadow government is actually failing against their opponents:

The 3rd Vault 7 Wikileaks release suggests that the white hats just completed a major chess move against the deep state. In essence, the Vault 7 release reveals that the CIA has anti-forensic programs in place (to cover their rear-ends). These are 676 source code files for the CIA’s secret anti-forensic Marble Framework. Marble is used to hamper forensic investigators and anti-virus companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA, but more importantly, it shows that they can cover up their own computer hacking into intelligence “dumps” such as suggesting Russia is responsible for everything happening in the U.S.

The Feds Are About to Be Audited

Just a few days ago Jason Chaffetz shocked everyone by saying that the House Panel on Government Reform was going to Audit the Federal Reserve. The House panel has approved legislation that will allow a government watchdog audit the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, a move bitterly opposed by the central bank. The move was passed after only about 30 minutes of debate. They had their minds made up it was time to sink these fools.

Other bills have been submitted before to audit the Fed that were shot down, but President Trump has expressed interest in carrying this one through. Let’s hope he actually supports this one to the bitter end. The Fed’s total abolishment would start with an audit, which would then give us ample proof of reason to shut them down for good.

The Truth About Vaccines is Likely Around the Corner

Del Bigtree the producer of the movie Vaxxed, says CDC Whistleblower Dr. William Thompson and his claims are being investigated. When he asked the oversight committee charged with investigating Dr. William Thompson’s claims that MMR vaccines were causing autism in the past he was met with blank stares. He is now reporting that every politician he speaks to knows exactly who Thompson is, and that his claims are being investigated.

The Syrian War Policy Has Been Changed

Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) called out our government a few weeks back and asked them to stop funding terrorists, after travelling to Syria for herself on a secret trip to see exactly what was going on. The U.S. also admitted that the ISIS headquarters they just blew up was an innocent family’s home, and Assange says the CIA created ISIS. Maybe that’s why the Syrian war policy is suddenly abruptly changing.

Something is Brewing with Pizzagate

After doing an abrupt about-face on Pizzagate, Alex Jones issued a formal apology. This should clue us in that things are heating up. Big media players like Money magazine and NPR reported the heck out of this abrupt change in opinion, without explaining why Jones would be so brash as to talk up the pedophile problem and then act as if it suddenly didn’t exist.

This news is also timed just weeks after Trump signed the Presidential Executive Order on Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking.

Now John Podesta is seeking immunity if he is to testify about Hillary, and other pedophilia business, which he has been linked to. I’m not sure who is about to wail on all the big wigs. It could be Podesta, or someone else to save their own rear-ends, but someone’s about to give up the goose. This could spell the beginning of the end for international pedophilia rings in the U.S. and U.K.

Our times stay interesting, if nothing else. Let’s hope the white hats are winning, and with our help to pass the message, the cabal’s attempts to control information are at least stymied.

Williams explains, “There are a number of factors here that are showing recession. Number one is industrial production. You can’t ignore industrial production; it is usually used with retail sales in timing formal recessions. It turned down last December, and it generally has not looked up since. You’ve had three out of four quarters in the last year contracting. The numbers that came out for the fourth quarter showed year to year contractions that you never see outside of recessions. This is typical of a formal recession. You are also seeing recession if you look at the housing numbers. They have turned down quarter to quarter for the fourth quarter . . . with housing starts. If you look at the stock market and the S&P 500, the revenues that are being reported for companies . . . revenues for the S&P 500 are falling off quarter to quarter. You never see that outside of a recession. That is a broad measure of economic activity. . . .The Atlanta Fed . . . their GDP number for the fourth quarter has just dropped to .6%. . . . I think it will be negative in the second reporting. With all these factors coming together, I think you will have an early call on a new recession or at least it will be viewed as a new recession in the early part of this new year.”

Williams says the main thrust of the Federal Reserve has been to prop up troubled banks that are still in trouble. Williams says, “There is very little the Fed can do now to help the economy. Actually, raising interest rates helps some because they can build a little more profit margin in their lending. . . .But if they run into trouble, if the banking system runs into trouble, they are going to do everything they have to do to keep the system from collapsing. They are going to be providing more liquidity and, if anything, they are going to be lowering interest rates. Along with that, you should see some reversal in the tremendous strength you have been seeing in the dollar. That will start to unwind all the craziness in markets like gold and silver and oil. . . . The reason why you have strength in the dollar is there is expectation here that interest rates are still going higher. The global economy, the global financial system is in enough trouble that the central banks, including in the United States, are going to go back into some sort of salvage operation, which will not mean higher rates in the United States. That will mean a reversal in the dollar’s strength. That is the primary prop behind the dollar, that and the expectation that the U.S. economy is booming along. I can tell you the economy is not booming along.”

Williams says that the Fed is still dealing with the fallout of the 2008 financial meltdown. Williams says, “They are still fighting the instabilities of 2008 that has not played itself out. When it does, they are going to be flooding the system with liquidity. It’s either that or they let the system fail. They decided in 2008 not to let the system fail. As they flood the system with liquidity, you will see weakness in the dollar. You will see a return of inflation domestically. You will see all sorts of other factors rallying such as traditional inflation hedges of gold and silver. If the dollar takes a significant hit, which I expect it will, that also will put upside pressure on oil prices. They did virtually nothing and did not address the things that led to the panic . . . now the economy is turning down anew.”

She was to infiltrate the rising black nationalist and civil rights organizations that were rapidly forming at the time. While the FBI was well aware of the rising tide of radical black American's infatuation with Communism, the federal agencies had one small problem. Due to a long history of overt racism in their hiring practices, they had no black Americans as agents. Therefore there was no one to infiltrate these radical black organizations. Our country's Intell agencies had a big problem on their hands. What to do? They decided to immediately begin recruiting black FBI (and CIA) agents but it would still take years to train them in order to infiltrate these groups. They then came up with an interim solution. They began to recruit young white women and use them to get inside the groups. Stanley Anne Durham was one of those white women. Growing up in the boredom of Kansas, young, restless and yearning for an adventure, she was an easy mark for recruitment. Of course, the leading factor in this recruitment was sex. Because there was only one way to gain the intimacy necessary to gather good intelligence, the young white women would have to have sex with these men. They had to create a relationship with them in order to gather data. Barack Hussein Obama Jr. is probably the result of one of these sexual encounters. From all outward appearances it would appear that Stanley Anne Durham was passed around certain radical types like Frank Marshall and Barack Obama Senior. It is very likely that no one knows who is the real father of Barack Obama. Not even the President-elect. At the time of his birth, or shortly afterwards, someone inside the Intell community decided to take the unwanted baby - born of Intell intrigue - and use that child for the ultimate infiltration. And that is why we don't know anything about Barack Hussein Obama. He has been wiped clean. He is the ultimate cut out."

The Far Left Liberals over at Time Magazine were nice enough to produce an article showing all the people killed or wounded in mass shootings here in America going all the way back to 1982. For the purpose of this article today, we focused only on the years between 2008 – 2016, the 8 years that Barack Obama was president. Time says that an astonishing 631 people were killed and wounded in mass shootings. Talk about an eye-opener.

So it comes with just a tiny bit of surprise that former president Obama would dare to rebuke President Trump for mass shootings on his watch while on Obama’s watch a veritable river of blood was flowing through the streets of America. But that’s what the fake news media is hoping for, that if they just relentlessly pound Trump 24 hours a day, you will forget about all the really terrible things that took place when Obama was president.

Obama Forgetting His Own Past As He Rebukes Trump Over Mass Shootings

FROM THE HILL: President Trump on Tuesday morning addressed former President Obama’s statement about the mass shootings last weekend, tweeting a quote from “Fox & Friends” co-anchor Brian Kilmeade criticizing the former president’s response to mass shootings during his presidency.

Trump tweeted the quote shortly after Kilmeade expressed dismay with Obama’s statements regarding the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, over the weekend that left at least 32 people dead.

“I’m just wondering did [George W. Bush] ever condemn President Obama after Sandy Hook?” Kilmeade asked, referring to a 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. “[Obama] had 32 mass shootings of four or more during his reign. Not many people said, ‘wow President Obama is out of control.’ 17 so far for President Trump. It’s way too high.”

“But I have news for you. Mass shootings were happening before the president thought about even running for president of the United States,” he continued.

In the wake of the shootings, Obama on Monday issued a lengthy statement urging Americans to reject leaders who feed “a climate of fear and hatred.”

“We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred and normalizes racist sentiment,” he said. “Leaders who demonize those who don’t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as sub-human, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people.”

Obama’s statement came as many Democratic lawmakers called for greater regulations surrounding gun purchases. It also came as more details emerged about the alleged shooter in El Paso. The suspect is believed to have posted an anti-immigrant manifesto on the fringe message board platform 8chan before carrying out the attack on Saturday.

Some have argued that the manifesto, which refers to Hispanics coming to the U.S. as an invasion, echoed Trump’s immigration rhetoric.

Trump on Monday urged the nation to condemn bigotry and white supremacy while delivering remarks from the White House. He also placed support behind “red flag” laws that would allow law enforcement to confiscate guns with a court order. READ MORE

784,True,The article suggests that there is a conspiracy by Democrats to push impeachment as a distraction from the uncovered Obama-era corruption.,True,"The article mentions several actors, including Democrats, President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Obama-era officials.",True,"The article discusses actions such as the Democrat-led impeachment, Giuliani uncovering evidence of corruption, Joe Biden's threat to withhold aid, and Hunter Biden's involvement with a Ukrainian energy company.",True,The article mentions threats such as the potential loss of aid to Ukraine and the possible misallocation of U.S. funds.,True,The article connects events and observations to suggest a pattern of corruption and wrongdoing by Democrats and Obama-era officials.,False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"Giuliani says he has uncovered “billions” in Obama-era corruption which is why Democrats are pushing impeachment as a distraction

Anyone who has been paying any attention at all to the Democrat-led impeachment of President Donald Trump, and who is fair-minded, knows that the current occupant of the Oval Office did not commit any “high crimes and misdemeanors,” which is the constitutional standard for removing him from office.

But the reality is, Democrats aren’t really concerned about impeachment. They know that the president isn’t going to be removed because a) the Republican-led Senate will never convict him; and b) the real evidence will show that the president is innocent and his political detractors are actually guilty of ‘high crimes.’

In fact, presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani has been busy uncovering a trove of new evidence of massive Obama-era corruption during recent trips to Ukraine, Hungary, and perhaps even Romania.

“Dem’s impeachment for innocent conduct is intended to obstruct the below investigations of Obama-era corruption:

Much more to come.

Interestingly, just as the House’s impeachment inquiry moved to the Judiciary Committee so that another blatant Left-wing partisan, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman, could have his turn at perpetuating the hoax, Giuliani traveled back to Ukraine in search of additional evidence of corruption.

As The National Sentinel reported, he found it.

Last week ahead of a campaign event in Florida, President Donald Trump told reporters that Giuliani had traveled back to Ukraine and that he had “found plenty” of “good information” during his trip there and to other European countries. The president added that he believes Giuliani wants to present a report to the Attorney General William Barr and to Congress regarding his findings.

But a One America News Network correspondent traveling with Giuliani reported that the former NYC mayor and federal prosecutor was provided with a trove of damning information on Joe and Hunter Biden as well as other Obama-era officials. (Related: Corporate media desperately trying to bury the facts about Joe Biden’s corruption, bribery and money laundering.)

— One Ukrainian official handed over official communiques and documents he says proves that Obama’s U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine and ‘impeachment witness’ Maria Yovanovich perjured herself during her recent testimony before a House committee;

— Another Ukrainian official, Victor Shokin, the former prosecutor general, described how then-President Petro Poroshenko waltzed into his office during the Obama administration and told him he had to stop investigating Hunter Biden or the country would lose a billion dollars in aid, as Joe Biden threatened (Shokin was summarily fired, as Joe Biden bragged);

— There are dozens of inquiries open into possible misallocation of U.S. funds in Ukraine, with the U.S. Embassy’s involvement.

If anyone demanded a “quid pro quo” from Ukraine, it was Joe Biden. And he did it on behalf of President Barack Obama, since he was the “point man” for that country.

The former VP said so on video. He blatantly admitted it, and yet, Democrats and their garbage media are pretending as though Biden never made the statement let alone the threat.

— A Ukrainian official has said that Joe Biden was paid nearly $1 million in “lobbying fees” while son Hunter made “millions” in fees as a board member for a corrupt Ukrainian energy company (the one Shokin was attempting to investigate);

— The Obama administration was informed by an official from the State Department that Hunter Biden’s sweetheart deal with Burisma was problematic.

The official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, testified before a closed congressional hearing that he was concerned how Hunter Biden’s position with Burisma looked and that it “would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest,” according to the Washington Post."
785,True,The article suggests that Russian hackers are being blamed for hacking into the email accounts of George Soros and Gen. Philip Breedlove. It questions the motives and assumptions behind the blame.,True,The article mentions Russian hackers as the actors responsible for the hacking.,True,The article describes the action of hacking into the email accounts of George Soros and Gen. Philip Breedlove.,False,There is no mention of a threat in the article.,True,The article connects events and observations to question the motives and assumptions behind the blame.,False,There is no mention of secrecy in the article.,"Russian hackers have been blamed for hacking into the email accounts of George Soros and Gen. Philip Breedlove.

Just as the western media laid the blame on the recent DNC hack to “Russian hackers” with very little proof, Bloomberg report that Russian hackers have yet again penetrated the systems of Open Society.

The report says that hackers gained access to the company’s intranet system called Karl, used to circulate draft program proposals, budgets and other internal documents.

“The hackers may have had access to the foundations’ network for nearly a year,” Bloomberg writes. “Although Open Society has about 800 full-time staff, as many as 7,000 people have access to Karl, which is used to circulate draft program proposals, budgets and other internal documents.”

The second target of the hack is the NATO’s former top military commander General Philip Breedlove.

“The hackers were apparently reading Breedlove’s personal e-mails that went back to at least 2012, a period when he was among the highest-ranking U.S. military officers and was commander of the U.S. European Command and NATO Allied Command Operations,” says Bloomberg.

Notably, the website blames the newest additions in what one could call an increasingly embarrassing row of US cyber security fails on “Russian hackers”.

Why they would think so remains uncertain, as the website says the following:

“Security experts now say that site, DCLeaks.com, with its spiffy capitol-dome logo, shows the marks of the same Russian intelligence outfit that targeted the Democratic political organizations.”

While Bloomberg fails to actually provide any reason why it should necessarily be Russian hackers and not someone else, it, nevertheless, attempts to guess the motives of the attackers, basing them on unproven assumption.

“The e-mails and documents posted to the DCLeaks site in early June suggest that the hackers may have a broader agenda than influencing the U.S. presidential election, one that ranges from the Obama administration’s policy toward Russia to disclosures about the hidden levers of political power in Washington.”

Thus, while literally anything regarding this event has no ground, it is a perfect target for speculations and assumptions. Sailing through the sea of speculations, it does not seem to be far-fetched to alternatively suggest the Open Society has been hacked by one of the organization’s disappointed employees. It is also not entirely unlikely to assume that General Breedlove’s email servers’ security was poor enough to let some inquisitive geek in. Who knows?

But, if the “Russian” version eventually proves right, one must ask how those Russians whose computer technology sector is, to be frank, far from dominating worldwide market, are so technologically advanced that they crack the top ranks of the country that is home to the Silicon Valley, time after time? Seriously, guys, the US created Microsoft Windows, Apple and the Internet and some minor regional power (according to President Barack Obama) seems to be able do whatever it wants with your servers?

However, Sputnik believes assumptions are unprofessional for a news agency and, as we expect some proof to emerge in the near future, would like to return to facts.

Facts say that earlier this year the Russian government has dismissed the idea that it was involved in the hack of the Democratic National Committee. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said there’s “no proof whatsoever” that Moscow was involved."
786,True,The article suggests that the US has a hidden agenda of regime change in Syria and is using terrorism as a tool to achieve it.,True,"The article mentions the US, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel as actors involved in supporting terrorism in Syria.",True,"The article talks about the US waging war, funding rebel groups, and supporting terrorism in Syria.",True,"The article mentions the beheading of a child, airstrikes killing children, and the overall death toll in Syria as negative consequences of the actions of the actors involved.",True,The article connects the historical support of terrorism by the US and Western imperialism to the current situation in Syria.,True,The article suggests that the US is hiding its true intentions and using the guise of fighting ISIS to justify its actions in Syria.,"The US war on Syria has intensified in recent weeks. A video has gone viral in the media of a US-backed ""rebel"" beheading a Palestinian child in Syria. Eleven more children were sent to an early grave from US airstrikes in the same week of the beheading. Overall, 73 Syrians were killed from the July 20th airstrikes. These developments further expose the regime change agenda of US imperialism in Syria.

President Obama's escalation in Syria has made it more difficult for the US to hide its true ambitions. The war has dragged on to a virtual stalemate since it began in 2011. Imperialist-backed terrorists continue to flood into Syria as the government holds on to sovereignty under immensely difficult conditions. Obama has repeatedly announced that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad “must go” if there is to be peace in the region. The US ruling class has effectively ignored the true wishes of the Syrian people. These wishes were affirmed in 2014 with Assad's landslide victory in the nation's Presidential elections.

The US has been forced to wage war on Syria without the approval of the US public. To hide the war's true character, the US imperialist apparatus has cloaked the destabilization campaign under the guise of fighting the Islamic State. Yet Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two of the US’s closest allies, continue to funnel material aid to ISIS. Furthermore, the US continues to fund and aid rebel groups that commit similar atrocities to ISIS. The double-sided war involving military operations against ISIS and aid to terrorists has led US imperialism to an inevitable dead-end.

The US role in the proliferation of terrorism is nothing new. For decades, US imperialism has given covert support to fundamentalist terrorists to destabilize independent governments. The policy began with the CIA-led creation of the Mujahideen mercenary army in Afghanistan under the Carter Administration. Afghanistan was in the midst of a social transformation in 1979. A new Afghan government was installed after a left-supported coup ousted a US and Saudi friendly regime. Its gravest mistake in the eyes of the US was to sign a friendship agreement with the Soviet Union. The US called the friendship between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan a ""Soviet takeover"" and ""invasion"" in order to justify support for the Mujahideen.

What US imperialism really opposed in Afghanistan was independent development broadly and socialism in particular. After the left-supported coup in 1978, the newly formed Afghan government legalized trade unions, expanded social services, and conducted a literacy programs for rural women. The political shift in Afghanistan threatened US corporate investment and influence. Over 35,000 CIA-backed terrorist fighters were employed to erase the threat. The proxy war eventually succeeded in toppling the socialist government in Afghanistan in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the use of terrorism would remain a staple of US foreign policy.

So while the corporate media instills fear in the populations of the West, the truth is that terrorism is a creation of US and Western imperialism. In the 1980s, Mujahideen fighters found support from Pakistani and, by extension, US intelligence. These fighters formed the skeleton of the international terrorist network “Al Qaeda.” The Saudi monarchy and the Gulf States trained, armed, and funded terrorism and deployed it wherever US imperialism reared its ugly head. When the US-NATO alliance deposed of Saddam Hussein and destabilized the Iraqi government in 2003, Al Qaeda and other terrorist militants found fertile ground to grow. The recent Chilcot report released in the UK has confirmed that the rise of the most powerful terrorist group, ISIS, arose from the US-led destruction of Iraq.

Terrorism has plagued Syria for over five years and remains the pillar of the imperialist war on the secular country. The same imperialist actors that continue to support so-called “rebels” in Syria are the ones who created the Mujahideen in 1979. The US, NATO, Israel, and the Gulf states have all played their respective parts. Israel’s influence on US foreign policy is unquestionable given how useful the apartheid state is to maintaining US hegemony in the region. The US-NATO alliance possesses deep economic and political relationships with the Gulf States as well. These states have entered into a pact to sew the seeds of chaos by way of terrorist-led proxy war. After these terrorists took power in Libya, the international terrorist network has expanded its operations into the North of Africa.

The common interest that the imperialist countries have in the Middle East region is regime change. The Gulf Monarchies, NATO, and Israel want to rid of the Syrian and Iranian governments, the last two independent governments in the Middle East, because of their sovereign character. Iran and Syria have refused to bow down to threats from Israel or cede the regional economic market to the Gulf monarchies. Both the Syrian and Iranian governments see themselves as sovereign countries and the rightful representatives of Syrians and Iranians. And the imperialist powers are far too unpopular in the region at large to allow any semblance of independence to exist alongside them.

The imperialist countries thus wage endless war to terrorize their so-called foes into submission. This has forced imperialism into a dead-end. Nations plagued by terrorism and proxy war have been rendered far too unstable for imperialism to economically benefit. Yet the imperialist countries cannot directly invade Syria or anywhere else without sparking deep protest domestically. So there will be more bombings and beheadings in Syria and throughout the region as long as those who commit such atrocities can rely on imperialism to bankroll their operations. The anti-war and peace movement in the US has yet to learn that the fight against terrorism means joining in solidarity with the people of the world who are fighting it head on. It is the duty of a rising generation of revolutionaries and radicals to correct this critical mistake."

Novartis has chosen to use a mammal cell line rather than the current, slower process using chicken embryos.

Debi Vinnedge, executive director of the Florida-based group Children of God for Life, said “We are extremely pleased to see Novartis advance in the market over those such as Sanofi Pasteur who are developing influenza vaccines using aborted fetal cell lines.” Novartis should be commended for “listening to public concerns.” Vinnedge encouraged the public to write the company and thank them for a vaccine that “will not force anyone to violate their religious and pro-life beliefs.”

Cell lines from two babies aborted in 1964 and 1970 have been used to create vaccinations for diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella, hepatitis, polio, rabies, chicken pox and smallpox.

The production of vaccines from these aborted fetal cells drew condemnation from the Catholic Church’s Pontifical Academy of Life in 2005. Though the pontifical academy said the use of such vaccines is morally permissible because those vaccinated do not directly cooperate in producing the vaccine, it stressed the “grave responsibility” to try to use alternative vaccines and to object to vaccines with “moral problems.”

Aborted fetal cells have also been used in the development of consumer products like anti-aging creams and artificial sweeteners. The San Diego-based company Senomyx, many of whose patents involved an aborted fetal cell line derived from embryonic kidneys, drew scrutiny when business agreements with soft drink maker PepsiCo and Campbell Soup came to light. Campbell Soup cut ties with Senomyx, while PepsiCo in April 2012 announced that it does not conduct or fund research that uses tissue or cell lines derived from embryos or fetuses.

So if you’re getting a flu shot or another vaccine, make sure you ask which manufacturer produced the vaccine. Tell your hospital, physician, or drug store to procure flu vaccine from Novartis.

788,True,"The article discusses the claim that precious metal prices are being manipulated by central banks and governments, suggesting a hidden agenda to suppress the prices.",True,The article mentions central banks and governments as the actors responsible for manipulating precious metal prices.,True,The article describes the actions of central banks and governments in suppressing precious metal prices.,True,"The article mentions the potential negative consequences of the actions taken by central banks and governments, such as a derivative nightmare and market blow-up.",True,The article connects events and observations to support the claim of precious metal price manipulation.,True,The article suggests that central banks and governments are intentionally keeping the gold and silver prices low to divert public attention and prevent a market blow-up.,"Bill Murphy, Chairman of GATA (Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee), says precious metal prices have been relentlessly rigged by central banks and governments. Murphy contends, “If gold were to just to have kept pace with inflation, forget all the QE, it would be double what it is today. That’s how artificially low the price of gold is today, and also silver. Once they lose control of silver, it will go from $22 to $100 per ounce very fast.”

Murphy claims that one reason precious metal prices are suppressed is central banks are afraid of what Murphy calls “a derivative nightmare” touched off by a rising gold and silver prices. Murphy explains, “We saw some of this before in 2008. There is counter-party risk all over the place, and it could set off like a nuclear reaction where there is one default after another. Derivatives have exploded to $250 trillion, or just pick a number. They don’t know what the outcome could be if they start getting this kind of reaction. So, they are maniacal in trying to keep the gold and silver prices in line.”

Murphy goes on to point out, “Silver is the only market that in which the authorities have not found wrongdoing in a market they have been investigating–the only one after a five year investigation. It is bizarre how that could happen. All this evidence we have collected is like a murder trial. If you were sitting on a jury . . . and looked at all the evidence, you would say guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. People don’t want to go there because we (GATA) are taking on all the money and power in the world.”

The U.S. Justice Department has recently granted UBS immunity in a criminal investigation of “manipulation of, or fraud in” the gold and silver markets. Why a serious Justice Department investigation now? Murphy says, “I am so skeptical after all these years, and it’s a question of where they go with this. If they are just talking about the gold fix itself—big deal. The ramification of how they are interfering with the markets all the time is the real issue. Why are they doing this now? Well, probably because it is so obvious, and they have been doing it in so many other markets they feel compelled to do something, so they are going here. . . . This is going to effect a lot of people, if I am correct, when this market blows up. Maybe they see something coming with allocated accounts and the gold isn’t there. . . . They know it’s coming, and maybe they are trying to preempt something here so they don’t look so bad.”

On the idea that the government would confiscate physical gold and silver if the price spiked higher, Murphy says, “I think the rest of the world would laugh at us. I give that a zero chance. I just can’t see it because Russia and China and all these other countries have gold, and are they going to confiscate their gold, too? The price would go bananas if they tried to do something like that, and I can’t see how they would want to draw attention to it. Their whole plan is to keep gold out of the limelight. . . . So, to confiscate it, people would ask why? I just can’t see it.”

789,True,The article suggests that there is a deliberate effort by the pharmaceutical industry to hide the negative health effects of vaccines and protect their profits.,True,The article mentions the pharmaceutical industry as the actor responsible for hiding the negative effects of vaccines.,True,The article suggests that the pharmaceutical industry is taking actions to defend and preserve the profitability of vaccines.,False,The article does not mention any specific threats.,True,The article connects various health problems to vaccines and questions whether it is a coincidence.,True,The article suggests that the pharmaceutical industry is actively hiding the negative effects of vaccines.,"If vaccines are truly effective at preventing sickness, it is only logical to expect vaccinated kids to be healthier than their unvaccinated peers. In fact, a desire to keep their kids healthy is the reason many parents blindly adhere to the prescribed vaccine schedule. At the same time, however, we’ve been hearing more than ever about kids with allergies, asthma, autism, and learning disabilities. Is this just a coincidence?

The short answer is no, according to a groundbreaking study from Jackson State University that discovered that unvaccinated children have significantly fewer health problems than those who are vaccinated. The study, which was the first of its kind, looked at more than 600 homeschooled children across four states between the ages of 6 and 12. A total of 261 unvaccinated children were compared to 405 children who were either partially or fully vaccinated, and their overall health was assessed. The findings were published in the Journal of Translational Sciences.

The fact that unvaccinated children have fewer health problems is incredible on its own, but what is really remarkable is just how big the difference is between the overall health of the two groups. In fact, some of the findings are absolutely mind-blowing. For example, vaccinated kids were an incredible 30 times more likely to be diagnosed with hay fever (allergic rhinitis) than their unvaccinated peers and 22 times more likely to have allergies so severe that they require medication.

In addition, kids who get vaccines were found to be 300 percent more likely to have a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and 340 percent more likely to have suffered pneumonia. Vaccinated kids were also 300 percent more likely to have had an ear infection and 700 percent more likely to have gotten surgery for the insertion of ear drainage tubes. Ear infections now affect four fifths of all of our nation’s children before they turn 3 and are a top reason for pediatrician visits and antibiotic prescriptions in this age group.

Despite repeated reassurances from “experts” that vaccines do not cause autism, vaccinated kids were three times as likely to have a diagnosis on the Autism Spectrum than their unvaccinated peers. Vaccinated kids were also 2.5 times more likely to have been diagnosed with any type of chronic illness than unvaccinated kids. This probably explains why 43 percent of American children – 32 million in total – have at least one of 20 chronic illnesses and are four times more likely than their parents to have one.

Why is this study so unusual?

It’s hard to believe that a study like this has never been carried out before, but the problem is that nearly all American children have been vaccinated, which means there aren’t a lot of control subjects available to study long-term effects. Comparing general American children to those from places like Amish communities, for example, where vaccines are not routinely given, is problematic because of the other variables that come into play. However, this study compared homeschoolers to homeschoolers, which is not only an equal comparison but also useful because homeschoolers as a population actually match the profiles of families in our country overall.

Despite being unprecedented and yielding a lot of surprising and useful data, this study probably won’t get a lot of publicity. Vaccines are simply too profitable, which helps explain why children today receive 50 doses of 14 vaccines by their sixth birthday. The pharmaceutical industry is willing to go to great lengths to defend and preserve this huge moneymaker, and they’ll probably do their best to make sure most people never hear about these shocking findings."

 In this groundbreaking Dark Journalist episode he welcomes the author of the fascinating book: Chemtrails, HAARP And The Full Spectrum Dominance of Planet Earth, Elana Freeland. Elana's 20 year journey into the realm of covert geoengineering programs, whose goal is to create a dominant Worldwide Smart Grid to ionize the atmosphere, centralize control and institute an all-powerful surveillance state, culminated in what Dark Journalist calls ""The best book ever written on these controversial subjects!"" Elana's investigation draws on the research of scientist Nick Begich and the work of her friend scientist Clifford Carnicom, the leading voices alerting the public to the dangers of large-scale Aerial Spraying and Ionospheric Heaters. Her penetrating insights into the controversial military policy of ""Full Spectrum Dominance"" and its ties to covert agendas for controlling the atmosphere have led her to secret programs that deal with Weather Warfare, Earthquake and Tsunami Delivery Systems, Nanotechnology, DNA Manipulation and Disaster Capitalism! 



 In her research she has found that the advanced technology that is behind such complex and mind-boggling activities is rooted in the same programs that created the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) back in the Reagan and Bush Sr. era that was dubbed ""Star Wars"" by the media. The further development of this technology led to the project called ""The Space Fence"" in which all life on earth was to be manipulated and controlled from above through nano-sensors with satellites observing the action on the ground. From Smartphone Entrainment to Wireless Surveillance, Data Mining and WIFI Frequency Wave Towers, the public is now paying for the very tools that will be used to control their every move and monitor their every thought, phone call, email, and emotion. Through the news blackout of the controlled corporate mainstream media an average person has little or no knowledge that the air we breathe is being loaded up with nano-particulates to form the basis of a gigantic worldwide antenna that will be hooked into all physical, organic matter and feed impulses into an Artificial Intelligence infrastructure. 



 Mechanized Tyranny or Creative Freedom?

 Will the Transhumanist agenda of corporate overlords merging with technology to dominate the earth and humanity come to pass? Is this the era of genetically-enhanced cyborg supersoldiers and controller attack drones funded by out of control black budget military programs and puppet-dancer politicians or will the exposure of these dangerous programs cause a radical shift in our 21st century paradigm? The choice apparently is ours.

This plan for world dominance relies on discretion, secrecy and deceptive tactics of manipulation.

If everyone would learn of this secret agenda of world domination and complete enslavement of the people, their plans for a NWO would crumble over night.

Thanks to Hillary Clinton and her clique, some of their darkest secrets have been exposed and we are now witnessing how the illusions of democracy and equal justice for all are starting to shatter. Behind these illusions, the naked truth is disgusting: these sick people are above the law.

Luckily for us, the recent events have started an avalanche that cannot be contained.

 

 We are currently witnessing the second wave of mass awakening, since 9/11:
• None More and more people are awakening to the fact that the MSM is operating as a propaganda machine for the “elite.” — Read more on the subject here
• None The sick world of the 1% has been once again exposed and the claim that we are being ruled by dark individuals with a dark agenda are starting to be taken seriously by a greater number of people than ever before.
• None By continuing the support for Hillary Clinton and her clique, the “elite” are showing us that there is no such thing as justice for those in positions of power. They will never be investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted.
• None By refusing to investigate the child trafficking and pedophilia claims of what is now known as the Pizza scandal , the government shows complicity. How many more powerful people are involved in this?
• None By launching an attack on alternative media with the unsubstantiated “fake news” claims, the government shows a real interest in covering up Pizza , whilst taking away from us one of the most basic democratic rights: freedom of speech

The truth is, their entire pyramid of control is supported by us. It was built on our shoulders and we are the ones keeping it in place.

As I have discussed on my previous article, “These 13 Families Rule the World: The Shadow Forces Behind the NWO,” we can “easily crumble to the ground their pyramid of power, by simply uniting against their deception in a peaceful revolution of minds, hearts and souls.”

(I encourage you to read the article, for it not only exposes the problem, but also offers a solution).

As I was saying in the beginning of this article, I am “disappointed” by how frail the 1% “elite” and their plans for a New World Order really are.

TPTB are far from being the omnipotent and well-organized group that I once though they were. In fact, they’re nothing more than a bunch of parasites fighting each other for more power and more money.

Let’s wake everyone up and delete the elite!

It has been the operating principle for everything from wealth to technology. With the efforts to discover a vaccine to the novel coronavirus being all but bound by solidarity, the race on plundering secrets has already begun in earnest. No one party can claim particular innocence in this endeavour. All states engage in economic espionage and old-fashioned secret pinching to advance their interests. Finding the building blocks for a COVID-19 vaccine is proving no different.

As with such accusations, the cloak is procured with the dagger. The case is probable, and plausible enough, but confirmation tends to come in rations. In the business of hacking, what is acceptable in torrid love and hideous war tends to be a hard one to pin down.

In 2015, the US and China reached an accord to, in the words of President Barack Obama, refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting “cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage.” At the time, an assessment by Wired came to the conclusion that the agreement did not prevent traditional, full blown espionage, focusing, instead, on such efforts as those to pinch company source codes for competitive advantage.

In addition to Obama’s main point, Beijing and Washington agreed to furnish timely responses to requests for information and assistance dealing with malicious cyber activities; engage in “efforts to further identify and promote appropriate norms of state behaviour in cyberspace” and “establish a high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cybercrime and related issues.”

In 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Centre (NCSC) reported that “the Intelligence Community and private sector security experts continue to identify ongoing Chinese cyber activity, although at lower volumes than existed before the bilateral September 2015 US-China cyber commitments.” Not all bad then, especially given that cyber activity designed to pilfer intellectual property for other non-competitive purposes continued to be de rigueur.

During the pandemic crisis, the niggles and pinches caused by cyberactivity have reportedly increased in number. Academic and research programs are being scrutinised. The US Justice Department has taken a particular interest in the PRC-sponsored Thousand Talents program. One of their latest targets is University of Arkansas’ professor of engineering, Simon Saw-Teong Ang, accused of concealing his ties to the Chinese government and universities while he worked on projects with NASA funding.

The United States, while not exactly leading in its response to dealing with COVID-19, now claims that its efforts to identify treatments and a vaccines are being targeted by others, with the PRC leading (naturally), the keen pack. “The PRC’s behaviour in cyberspace,” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued in a statement last Thursday, “is an extension of its counterproductive actions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.” Senator Marco Rubio, one of the noisiest of China hawks, has also been squawking on what he claims is an adjustment in Chinese tactics. “Beijing has shifted its recruitment efforts for the Thousand Talents Program online, and it has increased efforts to hack US medical research institutes for COVID-19 information.”

On May 13, a joint statement by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was published. It alleged “the compromise of US organizations conducting COVID-19-related research by PRC-affiliated cyber actors and non-traditional collectors.” Allegedly, such actors had “been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research.”

The statement warned that organisations “conducting research in these areas” should “maintain dedicated cybersecurity and insider threat practices to prevent surreptitious review or theft of COVID-19-related material.” Systems should be patched for “critical vulnerabilities”; web applications for authorised access should be actively sought out. Users “exhibiting unusual activity” should be suspended.

The warning is skimpy in details, notably on the issue of how treatments will be hampered. Nor are many researchers blind about similar pinching efforts from the US side of the fence. Jason Healey, a senior researcher at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs makes a few valid points on this. “If the US is wanting to argue for norms, I look forward to us doing it directly and saying here’s what we think the playing field lies, because certainly we’re being active in many of these areas as well.”

China has also been the subject of cyber interest in this particularly busy playing field. In April, a Vietnamese hacking group known as APT32 is said to have taken interest in the PRC’s Ministry of Emergency Management and the government of Wuhan. According to Ben Read of the cybersecurity firm FireEye, “These attacks speak to the virus being an intelligence priority – everyone is throwing everything they’ve got at it, and APT32 is what Vietnam has.” Not a good time, it seems, to find a vaccine in solidarity.

A quick reminder to our many faithful readers: Don’t believe everything you hear over at Fox News, despite the network’s seeming support for conservative, a.k.a. liberty-centric, ideals – because things are not always as they seem.

Just a few days ago, Fox News Medical Correspondent, Dr. Marc Siegel, declared war on health freedom by stating that he believes doctors who issue vaccine exemptions should be prosecuted.

Responding to the recent measles “outbreak” in Washington State, Dr. Siegel went on a tirade against parents who choose not to vaccinate their children with the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, expressing anger over the fact that some Americans are exercising their freedom not to vaccinate.

“This is a disgrace,” Dr. Siegel shouted during the segment. “And I am hoping that the doctors that are responsible for this get prosecuted.”

When asked to explain what he believes is the problem, Dr. Siegel went on to state that “there are a few doctors in California that are not even pediatricians, (who) are writing exemption letters for a ton of kids in certain schools.”

“Some schools have up to 20 percent of their kids don’t have the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine because they got a crazy exemption letter that’s fraudulent,” Dr. Siegel added, barely taking a breath amid his rant.

Big Pharma is the biggest advertiser at Fox News

Anyone who watches Fox News and pays close attention to what’s being advertised during every commercial break has likely noticed that the network pushes pharmaceutical drug after pharmaceutical drug after pharmaceutical drug – so much drug advertising, in fact, that Fox News might as well be renamed Big Pharma News.

With this in mind, it’s not really all that surprising that Fox‘s top medical talking head is aggressively pro-vaccine, as drugs and vaccines appear to be what keeps Fox News financially afloat. It would also explain why Fox News remains aggressively anti-cannabis, as healing plants are a threat to Fox‘s Big Pharma advertisers.

ALL Americans have the right to refuse vaccines for ANY reason

Contrary to Dr. Siegel’s wild claims, vaccine exemptions are not “fraudulent,” and all doctors, pediatricians or otherwise, are free to write them for whomever they wish. Further, sovereign American citizens are free to refuse vaccines for any reason, and don’t technically or legally need a vaccine exemption at all – though the medical establishment is working overtime to squelch that truth, as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, warned about.

“A medical doctor can give you an exemption for whatever you want, but there’s not even a law there,” points out Alex Jones from Infowars.

Be sure to watch the full segment with Alex Jones about the MMR vaccine below:

“So [Dr. Siegel is] saying it’s a fraud, when he’s engaged in fraud. See, he’s saying these are ‘fraudulent letters’ – you don’t even need the letter for the exemption. They just trick you into that. You have a right – there’s no law that you have to take these vaccines.”

According to Dr. Siegel, however, it’s a “problem” that parents are “allowed” to refuse vaccines even with a signed medical exemption. In his view, the MMR vaccine, and presumably all vaccines, are simply awesome – which, in his mind, means that everybody should be forced by the government to get injected.

“It is one of the greatest inventions in the history of public health,” Dr. Siegel maintains about the MMR vaccine.

(CBS)

The Vatican acknowledged Tuesday a report alleging that some priests and missionaries were forcing nuns to have sex with them and in some cases forced their rape victims to have abortions. 

 

Other nuns were forced to take birth control pills, according to the report cited in the Rome daily newspaper la Repubblica. 

 

The Vatican said the issue was restricted to a certain geographical area, but the report cited cases in 23 countries, including the United States, Brazil, the Philippines, India, Ireland and Italy. 

 

Missionary news agency MISNA condemned the abuse while recalling that missionaries often worked ""at the limit of human endurance."" It urged the media to remember the good deeds of missionaries around the world as well as their failings. 

 

A Vatican statement said ""in relation to the news of cases of sexual abuse against nuns committed by priests and missionaries the problem is known about and is restricted to a certain geographical area. The Holy See is dealing with the issue in collaboration with bishops, the Union of Superiors General (grouping of heads of male religious orders) and the International Union of Superiors General (heads of female religious orders)."" 

 

While the Vatican did not name the geographical area, the report said most incidents of sexual abuse against nuns occurred in Africa where the nuns were identified as ""safe"" following the onset of the HIV and AIDS viruses devastating the continent. 

 

Charges made in the report, signed with names and surnames, were made known to Church authorities on several occasions throughout the 1990s, according to the article by Marco Politi, la Repubblica's Vatican correspondent. 

 

The author of the report was nun and physician Maura O'Donohue, who presented it to the head of the Vatican's Congregation for Holy Orders, Cardinal Martinez Somalo, in February 1995. 

 

He ordered a working group from the Congregation to study the problem with O'Donohue, who was AIDS coordinator for Cafod, the London-based Roman Catholic Fund for Overseas Development. 

 

O'Donohue made specific reference to certain cases, one in which a priest forced a nun to have an abortion, after which she died. He then officiated at her requiem mass. 

 

In reference to Africa, her report said: ""It is impossible (there) for a woman or an adolescent to refuse a man, especially an older man and in particular a priest."" 

 

In Africa, certain priests sought out nuns ""for fear of contracting AIDS with prostitutes."" 

 

""There are cases in which priests make nuns take the pill...and there was one case of 20 nuns in one religious community being pregnant at the same time,"" the artile cited the report as saying. 

 

A mother superior was continually ignored by the local bishop when she complained that priests in the diocese had made 29 of her nuns pregnant. The bishop relieved her of her duties, the report said without identifying the diocese. 

 

The charges first appeared in the Kansas City-based National Catholic Reporter weekly on March 16 and in a small Italian religious news agency, Adista, which also publishes a weekly. 

 

In 1998, Marie McDonald, mother superior of the Missionaries of Our Lady of Africa, presented her report on ""sexual abuse and rape committed by priests and bishops."" 

 

The Vatican is monitoring the situation, making sure bishops were aware of the phenomenon, but no direct action has been taken, the article said. 

 

Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said in his statement: ""We are working on two fronts, training of people and finding a solution to individual cases. Some negative cases cannot let us forget the often heroic faith expressed by the large majority of those men and women in religious orders and of the clergy."" 

 

MISNA echoed his words, complaining in a statement that ""in general, people only ever talk about missionaries when they die, are kidnapped or when they make mistakes. If on the one hand... these incidents of alleged sexual abuse cannot and should not be denied or justified, on the other hand they prompt us to reflect on the conditions in which the majority of the tens of thousands of missionaries live on the fringes of the so-called Third World. Many of them live in situations of extreme psychological and physical hardship, at the limits of human endurance."" 

 

La Repubblica quoted McDonald as saying: ""As far as I know, no inspections have taken place...There are some nuns who become financially dependent on priests, who can then ask for sexual favors in return."" 

 

""Then there is the conspiracy of silence which makes the problem worse. Only if we confront this together, will we be able to find a solution,"" she said."

Wigington contends, “We have now enough data to prove that the greatest destructive factor, by far, on the ozone layer is geoengineering (chemtrails). It’s disrupting the hydrological cycle and disrupting the planet. We have governmental agencies that are set up to hide this fact from the population or to mask it. . . . We are seeing UVB levels that are a 1,000 % more than we are being told. . . . We have all the data being skewed to hide the severity of what is happening from the population for as long as possible. . . . We have friends behind the curtain that know this is going on and want it to stop. . . . I truly believe we have a growing number of allies behind the curtain that want this to stop as bad as we do. Let’s hope that is true and our allies grow because this is truly an all-out assault on all life on earth. How long can we hold our breath? Any breath we take is laden with these materials. We absolutely know it from lab testing. It’s not speculation or theory or conjecture. We see the human health statistics that are associated with this. The massive Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism and COPD. . . . Anyone who looks up, they can see how incredibly obvious this monstrosity is in our skies.”

Wigington is part of a group that recently filed a geoengineering lawsuit against the Canadian government. Wigington says, “It was filed on March 9th, and it is the first lawsuit of its type. We hope to follow suit in the U.S . . . and we hope what we do will be a template for others in other states. There is also legislation in Rhode Island currently under consideration to ban these programs. It is all designed to bring public awareness to the fact that we are under an all-out assault from toxic climate engineering. This is what the lawsuit in Canada is based on.”

Scientists who would like to speak out about the harmful effects of climate engineering (chemtrails) are being threatened and gagged as Wigington points out, “U.S. government scientists have no First Amendment protection–none. Now, there is a federal gag order on all National Weather Service and all NOAA employees. How much more obvious is this situation, and they are trying to plug leaks in the ship. We have environmental scientists being fired all over. Canada has let go a huge number of their scientists. Australia has fired 450 of their front line environmental scientists. Why? Because they want to cover up what’s happening any way they can. They are trying to obscure the severity of what is unfolding from the public for as long as possible. If we don’t take care of what is happening in our skies and environment, nothing else is going to matter. . . . Nothing is going to matter soon. That’s how bad it is. . . . What our government and other governments are doing is to try to hide the magnitude of what is unfolding until the last possible moment, at which time total collapse ensues.”

Who do you think these weapons are being used on? Victim testimony at the recent Bioethics Commission helps answer the question.

One control device was featured on the PopSci website: “The U.S. Defense Department has tested some spooky weapons, but those involving mind control and telepathic attack may be near the top of the list. A newly declassified 1998 document released under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act describes potential weapons for crowd control, such as a microwave gun that could beam words silently into people’s ears, and an electromagnetic pulse that causes epilepsy-like seizures.”

Some of this technology, on a far larger scale, is available to local law enforcement officials. In 2005, the LAPD tested a sonic device capable of projecting sounds on targets a mile away. “There was almost no distortion,” explains DefenseTech. “Sounds, especially those in the higher frequency ranges like sirens and screams, were easily detected. ”The report also discussed a weapon that can internally heat a victim’s body. It also noted that this equipment is currently available and that the results would keep a victim incapacitated for “any desired period consistent with safety.”

60 Minutes reporter David Martin subjected himself to a non-lethal beam weapon developed by the Pentagon.

“The gun is really an antenna, which shoots out a high-frequency radio beam that penetrates the skin to a depth of 1/64 of an inch, which is just deep enough to hit the nerves,” wrote another reporter who witnessed the event. “It creates an instantaneous sensation of heat, which makes anyone who is hit with it try to get out of the way as fast as possible.”

800,True,The article suggests that there is a deliberate effort by the corporate media to blame the victim (Syria) for the crimes committed by aggressor nations (NATO terrorists).

NATO terrorists, for example, are invading and occupying Syria, and the Syria government is blamed for the ensuing disasters, but the presstitutes omit this from their narratives and instead find creative ways to blame the Assad government whose duty it is to protect Syria, its sovereignty, and its territorial integrity. When terrorists are occupying cities, as they do in Syria, innocent people will always be victimized, including during government operations to clear out the terrorist infestations, but the presstitutes blame the Syrian government, not the NATO terrorists.

President Assad is fraudulently demonized for a war perpetrated by aggressors who are tasked with destroying Syria so the West can further the destruction under a fraudulent Responsibility To Protect (R2P) mandate, wherein criminal West promises to save Syrians from the West’s own terrorists. It’s basically a Mafia –style protection racket writ large: If Assad steps down, we’ll “protect you” and replace him with a Wahhabi stooge government, and everyone will be happy.

The reality of course, is that if the Western terrorists win the war, Syria will be totally destroyed, much like Libya, Iraq, and the Ukraine.

The crimes of the aggressors have been well-documented for years, and all but ignored by the presstitutes.

A 2012 Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) memo stated unequivocally that the U.S support for ISIS was willful. In an interview with Mehdi Hasan, Michael T. Flynn, former director of the DIA, was blunt.

“In 2012 the U.S. was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups [Salafists, Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda in Iraq], why did you not stop that if you’re worried about the rise of quote-unquote Islamic extremists?”

Flynn responded, “ I hate to say it’s not my job…but that…my job was to…was to to ensure that the accuracy of our intelligence that was being presented was as good as it could be.

The New York Times newspaper, another propaganda outlet, can’t help but reveal the truth, even if indirectly, when, in a recent article, “C.I.A. Arms for Syrian Rebels Supplied Black Market, Officials Say” it acknowledged that “ Weapons shipped into Jordan by the Central Intelligence Agency and Saudi Arabia (were) intended for Syrian rebels.”

Meanwhile, UN Security Council Resolution 1373 states clearly that:

All of this evidence assigns guilt directly to the West for the disaster befalling Syria. The West’s actions contradict international law, and they expose the lies of the presstitute media that typically vilifies the Assad government rather than the real perpetrators (including themselves).

Yet another recent article, “U.S. Relies Heavily on Saudi Money to Support Syrian Rebels”, indicates that the West is also behind the financing of the terrorists. The writers revel that:

Financing terrorists is also a violation of UN Resolutions (and international law). UN Resolution 2199 “urges”,

Add to this the fact that now Israel is publicly admitting that it prefers ISIS to the Syrian government, and we see that the presstitute narratives are falling apart yet again.

Dr. Bouthaina Shaaban, Syrian President Bashar Assad’s media advisor correctly assesses the damage committed by Western media outlets that propagate false narratives about Syria:

What will be the next story advanced by the genocidal media to account for the clear criminality of the West and its terrorists?

How many more thousands of innocent people will lose their lives because of the Western lies, and the grovelling presstitute media echo chambers covering for the criminality of the Western foreign policies?"

And when political ideology boils down to nothing more than “real” and “fake” the control of political discourse through language itself is almost complete. Can outright censorship be far behind?

Talk radio show host Alex Jones made quite the spectacle of himself after he was caught flip-flopping on former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Just five years ago, Jones accused Palin of being an operative sent in by the establishment to infiltrate the Tea Party movement. However, 11 months later, Jones reveals confidently that she’s the “real deal.”

Jones’ about-face on Palin quickly surfaced following her recent endorsement of 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump, whom the talk show host publicly supports. Formerly a self-described independent, Jones has slowly shifted his support to the Republican Party, abandoning many of his Libertarian views.

On Feb. 9, 2010, Jones is heard vehemently telling his audience that “Palin was chosen by Henry Kissinger to be the running mate of John McCain.” Kissinger, according to InfoWars, “routinely facilitated mass murder.”

McCain “is a pro-government bailout, pro-New World order, anti-gun candidate,” added Jones. “That’s all you need to know about Sarah Palin.”

Five years ago, Jones claimed that Palin was nothing but a “floozy, tart” sent in to distract Republican voters with her irresistible sex appeal, before criticizing the former governor’s attire and accusing her of wearing “hooker boots” and a “hooker outfit.”

Both Palin and Obama are “puppets,” he added.

Fast forward to last year and Jones is heard describing Palin as being “a lot better than Jeb Bush or Chris Christie.” She’s the “real deal,” he remarks. “She’d make a helluva VP, now that’s a winning ticket right there.”"

In 1993 Australia increased mining and milling uranium by 100%. They are now mining AND milling 100% of the year. I looked at atmospheric circulation in that region and sure enough the Coriolis effect and circulation gyres carry the uranium dust to the southeast so that the uranium dust is carried on air masses from the NE direction due to the circulation patterns. It is very complicated but I have attached the air direction map so you can see that Australian air is carried from west to east - past Tasmania. So, the cancers are being caused by the nanoparticle effects of uranium particles... not the radiation. It takes two decades for cancer to develop normally. These are occurring within months !!!!"

It mentions that official sources are not disclosing the full extent of UV radiation levels and that there is a discrepancy between the official narrative and the actual data.,"Air travel is becoming ever more hazardous to human health for a host of reasons. Not only are air travelers inhaling high concentrations of toxic particulates as they fly through various layers of solar radiation atmospheric haze (contributing to aerotoxic syndrome impacting passengers and crews), radiation clouds at aviation altitudes also pose a dire threat.

Climate engineering and the health dangers of air travel are completely interwoven issues.

A recently published study in a peer-reviewed journal is now acknowledging the radiation clouds and the dangers they present to air travelers.

Though there are countless forms of anthropogenic activity negatively affecting the atmosphere and ozone layer (including the ongoing Fukushima disaster), climate engineering aerosol spraying and the accompanying radio frequency/microwave transmissions are a primary factor that is wreaking havoc on the biosphere, the atmosphere, and all of Earth's life support systems.

Though the chart above reflects the official narrative for UV exposure, official sources are not disclosing the off the chart UV radiation levels that now showing up even at ground levels (including UVC). At higher altitudes, much higher concentrations of radiation are present and at far more dangerous UV spectrums.

The full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation is much more extensive than just UV radiation.

Electromagnetic radiation exposure is a very real danger, what is the full extent of damage being done to Earth's atmosphere from the ongoing climate intervention operations?

The vast majority of air travelers are not even slightly aware of the risks they are taking when they fly.

Most of the human race takes Earth's protective atmosphere for granted, this is a grave mistake.

We are told that the Earth's atmosphere stops most types of electromagnetic radiation from reaching Earth's surface, but current metering and corroborating data greatly disputes this official narrative. (Image credit: STScI/JHU/NASA)

We are all immersed in an increasingly toxic and radiated environment that is rapidly taking its toll on our health and the entire web of life. Of all the dangers we face, the ongoing climate engineering/weather warfare is mathematically the most dire and immediate threat we face short of nuclear cataclysm. We will sink or swim together. If the human race is to have any chance of long term survival, a complete course correction of our species must occur in the very near term. Who will join this epic battle to sound the alarm? Who will stand and make their voice heard for the greater good?

 According to this report, upon the FBI searching the Mandalay Bay Hotel room used by CIA gun runner Stephen Paddock, a cell phone charge was discovered that had no accompanying phone with SVRtechnology experts noting that this type of charger is used to charge a CP502520 3.0V 600mAh Li-MnO2 Non-rechargeable Thin Cell Battery used in various communication devices by both US Special Forces and CIA forces.--https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4631223/las-vegas-shooting-stephen-paddock-hotel-room-police-find-charger/

 

 The company making this unique lithium battery, this report details, is Ultralife Corporation, based in Newark, New York, that specializes in military communications systems for the Pentagonand whose lead engineer for this particular communication systems development was John Beilman.

 

 According to a source in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department:: The LVMPD knows the motive behind the attack, but the FBI will not allow us to release the motive because it implicates the FBI in illegal arms deals and supplying arms to ISIS terrorists within U.S. borders.The Mandalay Bay affair was likely part of a covert program to transfer weapons from the vaults of the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency of Homeland Security), fitted with hidden RFID tracking chips, to ISIS militants inside the USA. Stephen Paddock was an undercover FBI agent who participated in multiple illegal arms deals in the Las Vegas area in a gun-running entrapment scheme similar to Fast and Furious. Paddock thought he was engaging in another routine arms transfer, but ISIS had learned about the entrapment scheme and Paddocks true identity. They killed him and carried out the massacre, and then fled the scene.

 

 From these informal sources, three salient issues have surfaced:

 - indisputable evidence that a squad of multiple shooters were involved rather than just a lone gunman

 - the relocation of one of Paddocks airplanes between Virginia airports after an ATF agent was killed in the cover-up of Eric Holders Fast and Furious gun-peddling operation

 - the visits of Paddock and companion Marilou Danley to the UAE, Jordan and Israel while President Barack Obama was starting to turn against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

 

 Those morsels of vital information indicate that Paddock served for a long-time as contract agent for CIA-FBI gun-running and as a possible trained assassin.

 

 The Mandalay Bay affair was likely part of a covert program to transfer weapons from the vaults of the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency of Homeland Security), fitted with hidden RFID tracking chips, to ISIS militants inside the USA. Suspecting a sting operation, the ISIS team in Las Vegas shot him, Paddock to death in his room at the Mandalay immediately before proceeding to fire at the crowd of revelers attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Sunday night, October 1.

 

 Thats how one headline described the 2013 deaths of 20-year veteran ATF agent Paul Parisi and his wife Janine inside their home in Chantilly, Virginia. As an arson and explosives expert, Parisi was stationed at the local ATF field office, near the top-level forensic laboratory at Quantico, the FBI Academy, which also serves the scientific requests of Pentagons investigative unit called the Defense Security Service (DSS).

 

 One of the questions related to Fast and Furious was the possible role of a suspected mafia mole inside U.S. law enforcement, so DNA testing and chemical analysis were meticulously done on recovered Fast and Furious guns, putting Paul Parisi on the wrong side in the eyes of certain higher-up circles who were not eager to see his forensic findings reach Congress.

 

 The Awan brothers team had control of the computers in the House of Representatives, thanks to Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Tim Kaine along with the California Democrats were staunch in their support for open immigration and sanctuary cities, havens for ISIS sleeper cells; Obamas Pizzagate team set up a transport network for DACA children, ensuring a bright future for Islam in the New World; and Khizer Khan was gaining influence in the DNC. The counterattack was proceeding way faster than Saladins slow meandering drive against the Crusaders."

The most important factor, Obama won reelection.

 If Trump is doing BETTER than its just more evidence that Trump is on track to defeat the democrats come 2020.

But why is Trump’s approval going up? It is likely due to the far left push by Democrats and the more extreme positions being taken in an effort to one up each other. CNN reported that a democratic stronghold in Minnesota was flipping to republicans despite the town voting Democrat locally.

The only thing I see that can cause such a dramatic circumstance, where locals vote Republican nationally and Democrat locally, is that the 2020 Democrats have embraced far left positions to an extreme degree. Locally moderates fared well in the midterms, its the national level politicians embracing the far left.

The Coronavirus crisis took the US by storm, spiking unemployment and crashing the stock market virtually over night.

The media hysteria is based on a Bill Gates-funded IHME Coronavirus model that has been proven to be way off.

The amount of Americans who are reported to have died from the Coronavirus is based on a CDC coding system that will “result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause more often than not.”

A new ICD code was established to keep track of Coronavirus deaths.

The U07.1 code will be used for death by Coronavirus infection.

However, there’s another secondary code, U07.2, “for clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 where a laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available,” the CDC guidelines read.

“Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., NCHS is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics.”

“The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate. However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID- 19 being the underlying cause more often than not,” the guidelines read."

The conditions are perfect. The New World Order is prepared to use fire as a primary method of control to rid the state of California of its human inhabitants and to destroy what remains of California’s ability to provide food for itself and the rest of the country.

It has been very well documented that the current drought plaguing California has been engineered by spraying hundreds of tons of nano aluminum in the atmosphere coupled with the use of atmospheric ionic heaters also known as HAARP to create high pressure zones over the state while migrating the moisture that would normally fall on the state to other areas of the country east of California.

Is it just a coincidence that these programs are being deployed in an effort to deprive California of water while at the same time Agenda 21 states that it’s goal is to re-wild America? Is it also coincidence that our government uses weather as a weapon of war to drought out countries that don’t comply and use the U.S. dollar as it’s primary currency when purchasing oil? What is one of the first methods our government uses to soften up a country before a planned invasion is to take place? They attack the offending nations food and water supply.

The United States is under attack. Not by a shadowy group that we can never quite identify that is seemingly unbeatable but rather by a group of multinational corporations and banks that have publicly declared war on freedom and our way of life. When you look at the totality of what is happening to us it becomes clear that we are not dealing with raging incompetence but rather a very well orchestrated effort to undermine our Constitution and bring America to it’s knees. Let’s look at the various methods used to subjugate and domesticate our population rendering us incapable of living independently by producing our own food and electricity.

 

 1. Our Education system is under attack. Through the implementation of common core it becomes obvious that there is a deliberate effort to control what our kids are taught completely gutting our classical form of education. It should be clear that there is a deliberate dumbing down of America.

2. Our Environment is under attack. By spraying America with hundreds of tons of nano aluminum and barium and by introducing toxic fluoride into our public water supply our ability to think clearly, to reproduce and to grow our own food is greatly impaired.

3. Our Medical system is under attack. The passage of the affordable care act (obamacare) is literally destroying the quality of care in the U.S. by forcing doctors to follow government directives when rendering medical assistance to their patients rather than relying on their instincts and training to care for their customers.

4. Our Financial system is under attack. In 2008 when the housing bubble collapsed and our financial system failed our corrupt congress, despite receiving 99-1 calls against, bailed out the banks to the tune of TRILLIONS of our dollars and allowed companies that should have failed to continue to operate against all the rules of a competitive capitalist system. Our economy is a hoax controlled and manipulated by the big banks.

5. Our Justice system is under attack. Do you think it’s just a coincidence that only the little people ever get in trouble and go to jail? Don’t you find it odd that not ONE person was fired or even arrested as a result of the 9/11 attacks? Don’t you think it’s just a little strange that not ONE person was arrested and convicted for what happened in 2008? The federal government has a 98% conviction rate when they decide to single you out and prosecute you. Does that sound like justice to you?

6. Our Species is under attack. Just about everything our government promotes is designed to render us infertile and is designed to shorten our lives. This is called the soft kill method of population control. Have you noticed that fertility centers are popping up all over the place and everyone has cancer?

California is ground zero. The primary beta testing area for all of these programs. While over run with illegal aliens and taxed to the max California bans homeschooling for it’s citizens. While being inundated with radiation from Fukushima and cutting off water to the central valley destroying hundreds of producing farms California says they can vaccinate your kids at school without your knowledge or consent. While gang crime is exploding statewide California is disarming it’s citizens leaving them defenseless against criminal thugs.

Yeah, we’re under attack all right and California is the epicenter of this anti American agenda.

A report published by the European Commission in late 2019 reveals that the EU has been looking to increase the scope and power of vaccination programmes since well before the current “pandemic”.

The endpoint of the Roadmap is, among many other things, to introduce a “common vaccination card/passport” for all EU citizens.

This proposal will be appearing before the commission in 2022, with a “feasibility study” set to run from 2019 through 2021 (meaning, as of now, it’s about halfway through).

To underline the point: The “vaccination roadmap” is not an improvised response to the Covid19 pandemic, but rather an ongoing plan with roots going back to 2018, when the EU released a survey of the public’s attitude toward vaccines titled “2018 State of Vaccine Confidence”

On the back of this research, the EU then commissioned a technical report titled “Designing and implementing an immunisation information system”, on – among other things – the plausibility of an EU-wide vaccination monitoring system.

In the 3rd quarter of 2019 these reports were all combined into the latest version of the the “Vaccination Roadmap”, a long-term policy plan to spread vaccine “awareness and understanding” whilst counteracting “vaccine myths” and combatting “vaccine hesitancy”."
810,True,The article promotes the conspiracy theory that the unusually cold winter in the United States was manufactured by geoengineering.,True,The article mentions the military as the actor responsible for the alleged climate engineering operations.,True,The article claims that the military is using its resources for climate engineering operations to consistently cool down the most populated portions of the U.S.,True,"The article suggests that the current course of climate engineering will lead to abrupt climate collapse, which is a threat to all of humanity.",True,"The article connects various events and issues, such as political division, climate engineering, and radio frequencies, to support the conspiracy theory.",True,The article implies that there is secrecy surrounding climate engineering and its connection to other issues.,"Climate engineering researcher Dane Wigington says this year’s unusually cold winter in the United States was “manufactured” by geoengineering. Wigington explains, “Where you see the most anomalously cool place on the entire planet is the Eastern half of the North American continent. If we look at the departure for normal temperatures for the surface level going back nearly a decade, the most anomalously less warm place consistently for that span of time is the Eastern half of the North American continent. That is not nature. That is the country with the military that’s bigger than the next 10 militaries combined using its massive military resources and climate engineering operations to consistently cool down the most populated portions of the U.S. to continue fueling division and confusion in regard to the true state of the climate. . . . Here’s the bottom line. It’s not about our opinion at GeoEngineeringWatch.org or our theories or conjecture. It’s about hard data and frontline facts. That’s all we are asking people to look at.”

Wigington says things like the “Green New Deal” is a distraction that keeps people divided. Wigington says, “I would argue anybody on any side of the political equation that the orchestrated political theater that the power structure uses to divide the population to keep their eye off the horizon is a mistake. We need to get past any form of political division. Number two, there can be no legitimate discussion about the environment or the state of the climate without, first and foremost, discussing climate engineering. There can be no legitimate discussion about climate engineering without the winter scenarios it is creating. . . . Mathematically speaking, if we remain on the current course of business as usual, we will all be gone in a decade or less—all of us. This is a statistical mathematical fact. . . . We don’t face global warming. We face abrupt climate collapse.”

In closing, Wigington says, “We must reach a critical mass of awareness. We must awaken families of military members so that those military members know what they are doing to their own family and, hopefully, stand down. The only way to stop this issue is from the inside out to wake our military brothers and sisters to what they are doing. We are asking people to prioritize this most immediate threat we face. The radio frequencies that I want to weave into this, as well, that’s an immense threat. We are about to hit 5G. 5G is the same frequency as crowd control. It is an extremely dangerous frequency. These frequencies are part of climate engineering, as well. They are used to manipulate the particulates in the atmosphere. All these issues intertwine. They are all incredibly lethal. This is nothing short of an assault against life itself. . . . Please look past the theater of the absurd, and focus on the threat we face right here and right now. It’s an existential threat, and please help us sound the alarm. We need all of us in this battle or we have no chance.”

Quayle contends, “You have to understand, we are not just facing turmoil, we are facing the dedicated and very well positioned and financed overthrow of the United States government by former federal officers and by those in the military. I want to read the 13th rule of Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals.” They are doing this to President Trump. It’s character assassination. This is what people have to understand. The 13th rule is what Hillary Clinton, the Marxists and what all of the Obama Administration believe in, and they are following this blueprint. Saul Alinsky dedicated his book “Rules for Radicals” to Lucifer. He said at least he got his own kingdom. . . . So, here it is: ‘Pick the target (President Trump). Freeze it. Personalize it. Polarize it. Cut out the support network, and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after the people and any of the support, any of the institutions that support him.’ The point being is that is what we are watching. And this is the killer statement: ‘People hurt faster than institutions.’ The fact that these monsters, and that’s what they are, these media monsters, those mongrels from hell . . . going after the President’s son and going after his wife. . . . I am concerned with the treason, the treachery and total assault upon the military. When you see these people turning their backs on the President, former NSA, CIA, DIA, military commanders . . . kick their sorry butts out. I would also say this to anybody that has political clout. Call President Trump and tell him to bring back the commanders that Obama fired. Then, fire the ones that are there now.”

On the mainstream media propaganda, Quayle says, “I can’t believe that people cannot see beyond the BS, but you’re fed it in the news by the vomit brokers. I want to make this clear that you are considered by the mainstream media (MSM) to be stupid. You are considered basically zombies. So, all they are (MSM) are channeling you to their position. They will bring you to the point that you will say it’s better for everybody if I just die of starvation, or it’s good for the world if 90% of the world’s population is destroyed. When you have the richest people in the world believing that, believe me, you have got a problem. This is a spiritual war, and Lucifer is the ultimate rebel. . . . Even Hollywood has become more outspoken with its love affair with Lucifer and his plan to rule the world. So, we are seeing every single day the vilification that is a traditional moral, or anything that has to do with our borders, culture, our heritage, our monuments, our statues and everything, everything is being defaced. That’s what the Romans did. When one Roman conqueror came in, he wanted to obliterate the other ones. Same thing with the pharaohs in Egypt. . . . This is exactly what they are doing to our nation. . . . This is a spiritual war. What do they hate about Donald Trump? I’ll tell you. You see the President of the United States, a very powerful man, brilliant man, and he is surrounded, but his head is bowed as people pray for him. He knows that God put him in there against all odds. That’s God’s odds. There is a Bible verse that says the whole world be gathered against thee. The whole world has been, if you will, summoned to battle that man. Is he a King Cyrus or a Nebuchadnezzar? One destroyed the Jews, and one released the Jews. Cyrus was given a command by the living God to free the Jews and allow them to go back and build. They hate Trump because he believes in God and he is acknowledging him. Remember this, in the new age, you can be your own god. Donald Trump bows his head to God. The most important thing people can say is Mr. President I am praying for you. Prayer changes history. . . . This is a spiritual battle.”

The decision to torch the refinery, which once produced around a third of Iraq’s domestic fuel supplies, was made as the insurgents prepared to pull out of Baiji, which they captured last June in a victory that sent shock waves across world oil markets.

A year on from the start of the siege and a shaky alliance of the Middle East’s major Arab powers, with the limited support of the reluctant US government, has failed to contain the expansion of ISIS.

According to Daniel Yergin, the energy expert and vice-chairman of IHS, the business information provider, the biggest threat to oil prices is the political chaos that threatens to engulf the Middle East, combined with the West’s reluctance to intervene.

Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Yergin argued that the price of a barrel of oil could skyrocket to levels above $100 per barrel if Isil is allowed to press deeper into Iraq, the second-largest producer in the cartel after Saudi Arabia.

“ISIS represents a whole new reality for the region, which just isn’t reflected in the oil market at the moment,” said Mr Yergin. “It’s an increasingly grave situation for most of Opec and the Middle East. At some point the security issues will start to come back into the price of oil.”

Against this cataclysmic backdrop of bombs falling in Sana’a and with ISIS literally at the gates of the major Iraqi city of Ramadi, many US energy and security experts were shocked to hear President Barack Obama ignore the danger in a recent keynote speech in which he pinpointed global warming as an equally big risk for Americans.

“Climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security,” warned Mr Obama in a speech that many have criticised as symptomatic of the administration’s desire to disengage from the region which still provides a significant share of its oil.

Despite the growing focus on climate change and the campaign to limit fossil fuel production, ISIS will be a bigger concern for the majority of oil ministers around Opec’s table next week.

FLASHBACK 2012: In the 2012 campaign, Obama spoke not only of killing Osama bin Laden; he also said that Al Qaeda had been “decimated.” I pointed out that the flag of Al Qaeda is now flying in Falluja, in Iraq, and among various rebel factions in Syria; Al Qaeda has asserted a presence in parts of Africa, too. “The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant,” Obama said, resorting to an uncharacteristically flip analogy. source

The Obama administration’s reluctance to intervene marks the end of a US policy to protect the region’s oil which has remained in existence since President Franklin D Roosevelt first met with modern day Saudi Arabia’s founder King Abdulaziz in 1945. It was this commitment that drew America into the first Gulf War in 1991 and again in 2003 when it decided to bring down the curtain on Saddam Hussein’s regime.

However, Mr Obama’s lack of a viable alternative foreign policy for the region has put world energy markets at risk. source"

This news is compounded by an NGO Monitor report about World Vision:

“According to World Vision, “Our work in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories remains one of the most challenging places where we operate, and one of the most difficult for children. That’s why we have been there for more than 40 years.”

 Promotes a highly politicized and biased agenda, placing sole blame for the continuation of the conflict on Israel and paying little attention to legitimate Israeli security concerns or Palestinian terrorism against Israeli civilians. This includes calling the security barrier “illegal,” ignoring the fact that the barrier was built in the wake of the second intifada in which Israeli civilians were the targets of near daily suicide bombings.

And how does World Vision justify its anti-Israel bias?

“We are Christian: “We seek to follow Jesus — in his identification with the poor, the powerless, the afflicted, the oppressed, and the marginalized … in his challenge to unjust attitudes and systems; in his call to share resources with each other …”

Unfortunately, truths including Israel’s history, justice, the history of jihad and the Palestinian leadership’s aim to obliterate Israel since 1948 are of little concern to a group which claims to “follow Jesus.”

This isn’t the first time World Vision has been implicated in promoting jihad terror. The Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy reported:

“World Vision is a well-established international Christian relief organization that has operations in the Palestinian Authority and the Gaza Strip. Hamas’s military wing recruited Mohammed Halabi in 2005, and in 2010 Halabi became Regional Manager of World Vision in Gaza until he was arrested in 2016. During this time, Halabi took advantage of his position and transferred aid, equipment and relief packages sent by World Vision to Hamas, which were used to pay the salaries of Hamas operatives, and support the

 construction of terror tunnels and Hamas’ military buildup. Approximately 60% of the NGO’s Gaza branch’s annual budget was transferred to Hamas.

The Rwandan refugee camps were reportedly first shelled in a military operation involving the International Rescue Committee (IRC), one of the UNHCRs main partners today. The IRC is an agency that does not work directly with refugees and has been criticized for its direct involvement in military operations.

 Humanitarian organizations operating among the Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire and Belgian newspapers accused some US refugee non-governmental organizations, especially the [IRC] of being covers for CIA operations, reported intelligence insider Wayne Madsen. Two Belgian newspapers, Antwerp Gazette and De Standaard, reported that the IRC was actually engaged in military operations and military support operations in support of [Laurent] Kabilas rebels in eastern Zaire.

 According to UNHCR documentation, IRC agents are allowed to move freely in and out of UNHCR and other UN field operations.

The “Panama Papers” revealed financial arrangements of global politicians and public figures including friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin, relatives of the prime ministers of Britain, Iceland and Pakistan, and the president of Ukraine.

While holding money in offshore companies is not illegal, journalists who received the leaked documents said they could provide evidence of wealth hidden for tax evasion, money laundering, sanctions busting, drug deals or other crimes.

The law firm, Mossack Fonseca, which says it has set up more than 240,000 offshore companies for clients around the globe, denied any wrongdoing and called itself the victim of a campaign against privacy.

The Kremlin said the documents contained “nothing concrete and nothing new” while a spokesman for British Prime Minister David Cameron said his late father’s reported links to an offshore company were a “private matter.”

Financial prosecutors in France announced the opening of a preliminary investigation for aggravated tax fraud.

Germany would also “pick up the ball” in the case, a Finance Ministry spokesman said on Monday. Financial market watchdog Bafin is looking into the matter, said a source close to the regulator, which reports to the ministry.

Australia, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands were among other countries which said they had begun investigating the allegations based on more than 11.5 million documents. Banks came under the spotlight over allegations that they helped clients hide their wealth offshore.

A White House spokesman said that while he had no specific comment on the leaked papers, “greater transparency allows us to root out corruption.”

The documents, covering a period from 1977 until last December, were leaked to more than 100 news organizations around the world, cooperating with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), a Washington, D.C.-based network.

“I think the leak will prove to be probably the biggest blow the offshore world has ever taken because of the extent of the documents,” ICIJ director Gerard Ryle said.

Government leaders around the world responded to the leaks on Monday with denials or declining comment.

Pakistan denied any wrongdoing by the family of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his daughter and son were linked to offshore companies.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko defended his commitment to transparency after lawmakers called for an investigation into allegations in the documents that he had used an offshore firm to avoid tax. Poroshenko purportedly moved his confectionery business, Roshen, to the British Virgin Islands in August 2014 as fighting between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists peaked. source"

I told you that the downing of Malaysian flight 17 would not have any effect on what was coming. The investigation has been halted because of fighting in the area, and it really makes no difference who shot it down because war is coming no matter what. Right now, the economic war has intensified with Russia imposing its own sanctions on the EU and the U.S. It will be stopping many different agricultural products from entering Russia, such as fruits and veggies and meat. Russia is the second biggest market for U.S. poultry, and you are going to see a steep drop in chicken prices followed by a price spike when producers shut down some production. This does not mean much to the U.S. as it is a small percentage of its agricultural business, but Europe is a different story. Russia is a huge recipient of EU food, and this will hurt Europe and, yes, that includes Germany. Please keep in mind that Europe is in much worse financial shape than the U.S. Italy is a basket case economically, as is France, and many countries they call the PIIGS. Even Germany is feeling the pinch of a trade war with Russia. Wait until fall and winter when Europe really needs Russian natural gas to heat their homes and businesses. Right now, Russia has 20,000 troops on the Eastern Ukraine border. Might Putin invade or will he just wait for winter? Who knows, but Putin holds the Ace of Spades in energy, and as I told you before, the sanctions would not work. The Russians are tough, and I still say sanctions will never work on them, and they may even backfire and destroy NATO.

The U.S. has started humanitarian and military action against Islamic terrorists called ISIS, or the Islamic State. The group has seized a large land mass straddling the borders of Syria, and Iraq is on the move. They are killing everyone who gets in their way, and this includes beheading and crucifixion. They have killed thousands of Christians and some Muslims. Many more are running for their lives. The humanitarian aid is going to a group of 40,000 Christians stranded on a mountain in Northern Iraq. The Obama Administration says it will bomb ISIS where needed, but is that going to work long term–probably not. Is this the beginning of the U.S. going back into Iraq—probably so. This is one very wicked power, and I think one of the Islamic State’s goals in the region is to destroy Saudi Arabia and its Royal family.

The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas has officially ended. There were a few rockets fired from Gaza, but some Palestinian officials want the cease-fire to continue. It appears that neither side is backing down on its demands. Hamas wants its borders opened and prisoners released. Israel wants assurances that the rocket fire will stop and Hamas to disarm. The Israelis also want an end to the creation of the so-called terror tunnels that Hamas was using to come into Israel to attack them. Something like 40 tunnels were destroyed. Some of them were more than a mile long. There is lots of blame to go around with deaths on both sides. The Palestinians have suffered the most with nearly 1,900 casualties. There are high numbers of women and children killed. Hamas says Israel is targeting civilians. Israel says that is not so and that they try to avoid civilian deaths. President Obama came out this week and said he has much sympathy for the Palestinian people in Gaza, but no sympathy for Hamas. Obama said Hamas deliberately fired rockets from population centers. Netanyahu gave a press conference and showed video of rocket attacks fired near civilian locations. 3,500 rockets were fired by Hamas into Israel. This is warfare and there is no peace plan in sight, just more fighting.

Finally, there is new poll out where 70% of Americans (both Democrats and Republicans) say illegal immigration is a threat to both the economy and our culture. Getting 70% of anyone to agree on anything in this country is significant. I cannot see how all this illegal immigration is going to help the Democrats this fall in the mid-term elections.

According to the Acting United States Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick, 37-year-old Stephen Salamak, of Lodi, New Jersey was arrested by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) after placing an advert on Craigslist requesting “cheese pizza.”

According to an internal FBI document leaked by WikiLeaks, “cheese pizza” is pedophile code for “very young girl.” This pedophile code word – among others – appears liberally in John Podesta’s emails, also released by WikiLeaks in the latter stages of the 2016 presidential election.

While Stephen Salamak, a lowly New Jersey government employee, was arrested after his use of the term tipped off law enforcement to his alleged crimes, John Podesta remains free.

Salamak was charged with receiving child pornography according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. Speculation that the corrections officers advert was related to Pizzagate has now begun to circulate across forums and social media.The criminal complaint against Salamak as reported by local news Press of Atlantic City states: “In May, an undercover law enforcement officer responded to a Craigslist ad, placed by Salamak, seeking “Woman/Moms that are into Cheese Pizza.”

The Goldwater reports: The complaint said Salamak communicated with the undercover officer and requested photos of an 8-year-old child. In July, authorities executed a search of Salamak’s email account, finding he communicated with multiple people about pornography and pedophilia.”

A search warrant of Salamak’s home was executed on Thursday, where admitted to authorities “Cheese Pizza” was a reference to child pornography, he knowing received emails containing child porn and knowingly communicated with various individuals regarding child pornography and pedophilia.”

Denmark has passed an emergency law that allows for the government to force people to take a vaccine for coronavirus.

The emergency law gives authorities sweeping powers to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain in force until March 2021.

Citizens who refuse to be tested for the coronavirus will face fines and potential prison time, and will be prevented from entering shops, grocery stores, public institutions and hospitals while also being restricted from using public transport.

“As well as enforcing quarantine measures, the law also allows the authorities to force people to be vaccinated, even though there is currently no vaccination for the virus,” reports the Local.

Copenhagen University law professor Jens Elo Rytter said the new measures were “certainly the most extreme since the Second World War.”"

Evergreen Air is a CIA front company for chemtrail operations within the US, based out of Marana Air Park near Tucson Arizona and McMinville Oregon, near Portland.

A major missing piece of a grand conspiracy has been targeted by a drunk pilot. In a small town 30 miles east of the Pacific Ocean in Oregon is the center of a major global operation. At a bar in McMinnville, Oregon, an inebriated pilot attempted to impress one of the pretty ladies with tales of his secret mission.

The pilot’s pathetic attempt to portray himself as a Sean Connery or Daniel Craig caused him to (ante up) his importance and spill the secrets of the CIA’s asset Evergreen International Aviation.

The slurred revelations confirmed suspicions that Evergreen (International Aviation) is part of the major crap dump on the planet. Chemtrails made up aluminum, barium and other ingredients contribute to respiratory ills and change the acidity of the soil.

Evergreen works from over a 100 bases and employees 4,500 people. Delford Smith privately owns the company. They admittedly “perform” for the CIA.

Evergreen was given a no contest bid that gave them all the facilities in Marana, Arizona that previously belonged to CIA’s Air America (Pinal Air Park, Arizona).

The security at the Pinal site is said to be as severe as that of Area 51. It is run as a military base where one lost pilot got an armed escort immediately off the operational base. The 10 year pilot said it was nothing like anything he has ever seen.

Evergreen International Aviation brags of their planes that have 7 times the capacity of other fire fighters. One can carry 20,000 gallons. Firefighting … Right … and next we will be told the chem trails are to prevent global warming as millions more are advancing to an early death.

Evergreen International Aviation has exemptions from the law that are advertised on their web site. They can fly anywhere and not stay on a designated route. Has CFR members paved the way? People like Philip Lader and John Wheeler III … they were in a position to do just that.

Evergreen’s public relations (propaganda) spokesman is handled by WPP run by Council on Foreign Relations member Philip Lader. He worked under the present head of the CIA … Leon Panetta as White House deputy of staff under Bill Clinton.

Philip Lader is an “inside” authority on international affairs and business. He is the non-executive Chairman of WPP Group, Senior Adviser to Morgan Stanley International, and a board member for think-tank RAND Corporation. He is also a trustee of UC Rusal (largest aluminum company in the world) the British Museum and St. Paul’s Cathedral Foundation. Ambassador Lader has addressed trans-Atlantic audiences from the U.N.’s General Assembly Hall to state chambers of commerce and local world affairs councils, is a member of Rockefeller’s Council on Foreign Relations.

Philip Lader (CFR) is a key player driving toward world government. In addition to running the Public Relations for Evergreen International Aviation … Lader is a director of UC Rusal, the largest Aluminum producer in the world located in Moscow, Sweden, Italy, and Australia. Nathaniel Rothschild is a big investor.

Eugenic operation of Chemtrails has had the assistance of Mitre a non-profit Corporation that manages the Federal Aviation Administration, Homeland Security, and IRS. (1) The IRS is part of the Federal Reserve which is a major transmission belt driving the conspiracy.

Philip Lader’s fellow Council on Foreign Relations member John P Wheeler III was recently dumped into a land fill in Wilmington, Delaware. Wheeler III was a consultant to Mitre the non profit corporation with jurisdictional advice over the Federal Aviation Administration’s flight patterns.

Was John P. Wheeler III to sentimental for the killing underway? And got murdered by the Company?

The CIA is the enforcement arm of the Council on Foreign Relations

Mitre is conveniently located in McLean,Virginia home of the CIA.

Thanks to the drunken pilot and his loose lips … the Free People of the world can focus on the criminals who are poisoning our air and our water."

– US Senate approves John Kerry as secretary of state (BBC News, Jan 29, 2013):

The US Senate has approved Senator John Kerry’s nomination as secretary of state, after he was backed unanimously by the foreign relations committee.

His confirmation after a 94-3 vote was met with applause on the Senate floor.

President Barack Obama chose the Massachusetts Democrat to succeed Hillary Clinton, who is stepping down after four years, as his top diplomat.

A Vietnam veteran and senator since 1985, Sen Kerry was the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004.

Sen Kerry, 69, first came to national attention as part of his involvement with Vietnam Veterans Against the War.

He served on the Senate foreign relations committee himself for 28 years, and chaired it for four.

His nomination is part of Mr Obama’s second-term cabinet reshuffle.

Sen Kerry was put forward after the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, withdrew from consideration in December.

Republicans had fiercely criticised her response to last September’s deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The Evergreen Health elderly care facility in Kirkland, Washington, where multiple patients with the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) were transported for treatment a few days back has announced that it will no longer test for the novel disease because the government says it has already gone “endemic.”

In a “Community Message” to its staff, the facility explained that new screening protocols are now being put in place due to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) determination that the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) has basically breached containment, and can no longer be controlled.

“As of March 3, 2020, we have halted performing nasopharyngeal testing in our outpatient clinics, including all five urgent care locations,” Evergreen says, noting that the CDC determination is what led to this change.

“The CDC has determined COVID-19 is now endemic, meaning that the virus is now considered to be regularly found in our region amongst our population,” the memo further explains.

While the standard previously was to test only people with known risk factors such as history of travel and exposure to a confirmed case – these being high-risk candidates for acquiring the disease – Evergreen is simply going to stop testing everyone because there’s no real point, the facility has decided.

As a secondary reason for not conducting anymore testing, Evergreen added that there “is an increased risk of transmission when performing any nasopharyngeal testing,” which begs the question: Why was it being performed previously, then?

Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses the prevalent belief that this entire Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) crisis is nothing but a giant hoax:

Three more infected Life Care Center residents have died, bringing Washington death toll to 22 statewide

Most of the coronavirus patients who were brought in to Evergreen Health came from the nearby Life Care Center, where we have since learned that another three patients have died, raising Washington’s total statewide death count to 22.

According to Seattle & King County Public Health, there were 33 new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) reported through Sunday, and 116 total known cases of the disease in King County as of March 9.

Two have since died from these 33 new cases, while the third death occurred in a previously reported case. All three of these latest deaths occurred in elderly people, one in her 70s, one in her 80s, and one in her 90s.

“Of the 20 deaths reported in King County, 19 are associated with Life Care Center,” a local news affiliate has reported. “There is one death in Snohomish County and another death in Grant County.”

The latest test results have arrived for 35 of Life Care’s 55 residents, revealing 31 positives, one negative, and three inconclusive results. The facility is still waiting to receive test results for the remaining 20 residents.

Despite promises by the Trump administration that there would be one million new test kits available by the end of last week, this never actually happened. Consequently, testing remains limited, and is only available to people who meet strict criteria.

“While testing is becoming more available, there are still limitations,” reports explain.

“If you have symptoms and are high risk, call your health care provider and have a conversation with them about whether it makes sense for you to get tested for COVID-19. Public Health does not do testing. You’ll have to get tested through your health care provider.”

The only real prevention advice that the government is offering, anyway, is to wash your hands, avoid people, and constantly disinfect your home. Authorities are also advising the public to pay close attention to any symptoms that might develop.

They have been identified as members of the Heaven's Gate Cult. The cultists believed that the Hale-Bopp comet was a marker for them to kill themselves so that they could join a UFO trailing behind it. Each dead person had a suitcase packed so that they would have clothes for their new life. Unsurprisingly, the suitcases were left behind--you don't need a change of clothes in hell.

When I first read this story, I knew that the members of Heaven's Gate were New Age zealots. If you ever want to hear some mumbo-jumbo, check out a New Age site. You might read, ""I know that I'm God, but Self alludes and misunderstands,"" or ""The metaphysical hypotenuse correlates with the Arias coordinates.""

Today's (3-28-97) front page Washington Post story first references the cult's belief system in the third paragraph. The writers state:

But then, through the article, they give the opinion of cult EXPERT and exit counselor, Joe Szimhart:

Now if the expert says that they were New Age fundamentalists, why would the authors dare to put the description ""Christian-style"" at the beginning of the article? I believe it is because this world is as hostile to the cause of the Lord Jesus Christ as it was when He walked the earth. Anything to take a jab.

The leader of the cult Marshall Herff Applewhite claimed that he came to this earth 2,000 years ago as Jesus, yet they speak badly about Christianity. When people say no to the Lord, He gives them over--Satan then confuses and blinds their minds. Romans 1:28-32,

And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

The above is a menu of today's society. You can find ALL of this wickedness on television and in the street. No one can honestly deny this fact. The Bible exposes who we really are. It doesn't matter if we're talking about cultists, academicians, criminals, farmers or any other socio-economic-religious class--if they ain't got Jesus, they dwell somewhere in Romans chapter 1.

The cult members were not permitted to marry, have sex or drink. They had to give all their possessions to the cult. On their website, the cult gives a ""scriptural basis"" for not getting married (and again, I quote the Post article):

The cited scripture is out of context. Some Sadducees (v.27) came to Jesus trying to tempt him and asked about marriage in the kingdom of heaven, not here on earth. Luke 20:34-36 gives the Lord's response:

Of course, the Post didn't try to correct that misquotation of the Bible."

The government watchdog's presdient Tom Fitton says ""new numbers out of Texas and Pennsylvania"" show that ""foreign nationals"" voted illegally ""in massive numbers"" during last year's midterms.

The warning comes as election voter fraud is becoming a major concern ahead of the upcoming 2020 presidential election.

According to a report by The Heritage Foundation, 1,177 instances of voter fraud have so far been proven.

According to Sara Carter, Fitton said Judicial Watch has sued several states such as Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and California.

The conservative watchdog group that has gained prominence in uncovering corruption through utilizing the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to documents.

In most cases, said Fitton, there were more people were on voter rolls than those who could actually vote.

Further, the group found 3.5 million extra names on national voter registration rolls.

“Dirty voting rolls can mean dirty elections,” said Fitton.

Unexpectedly, Texas is also a breeding ground for fraud. According to the Real Clear Investigations report, Nueces County Clerk Kara Sands discovered that individual votes were being stolen.

Initially, Sands was tipped off by an ex-cop who shared his concerns with mail-in ballots. Sands found piles of mail-in ballots each signed by the same person.

“The harvesters come along at election time and bring food, they have these neighborhoods mapped out and they can go door to door and build relationships. Mostly elderly people are being victimized and they don’t even know it,” said Sands.

In 2018, every house seat in Orange County, CA went to a Democrat.

However, Orange County is widely acknowledged as one of California‘s only Republican-held majority regions.

An unprecedented 250,000 votes were mailed in that year.

For example, in 2016, Former California Governor Jerry Brown legalized ballot harvesting.

Basically, Brown allowed mail-in ballots to be submitted by anyone including campaign workers and political party officials.

Most importantly, this nation was founded on the principle of state sovereignty and individual freedom.

It was not about creating a menacing federal government.

This is why the electoral college exists.

The voter fraud issue is a hijacking of individual liberties.

What is happening is party interests are superseding the rights of the individual. Further, harvesting votes discounts some of the greatest historical achievements our country has ever seen such as women’s suffrage and the passing of the 15th amendment."

Billionaire describes ex-president as his 'greatest disappointment' during interview

As George Soros' icy grip around the throats of the American people is slowly melting away, cracks are begging to form in the alliance between the billionaire globalist and high-level Democrats.

During a wide-ranging interview published in the New York Times on Tuesday, Soros described former President Barack Obama as his ""greatest disappointment"" for failing to prevent Donald Trump from disrupting the New World Order agenda.

Mr. Soros, who was an early supporter of Obama’s 2008 presidential run, and a major backer of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, told The Times that Obama was “actually my greatest disappointment.”

The wealthy liberal donor also appeared to distance himself altogether from the Democrats.

Soros went on to say that he was dissatisfied with Obama on a “professional level,” telling the newspaper that Obama ""closed the door"" on him after he secured the presidency, adding:

“He made one phone call thanking me for my support, which was meant to last for five minutes, and I engaged him, and he had to spend another three minutes with me, so I dragged it out to eight minutes.”

Fox News reports: Soros told the paper that he had hoped to have been consulted on economic and financial issues and that Obama was known to “take his supporters for granted and to woo his opponents.”

Soros, who also poured millions of dollars into Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run, wouldn’t say if he would back Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the upcoming presidential election.

But he did say that when it comes to politics, “I don’t particularly want to be a Democrat.”

While speaking with The Times, Soros praised Arizona Sen. John McCain and said the main priority of his political activism was to promote bipartisanship – noting that Republicans on the far-right led him to become one of the top funders for the Democratic Party.

But as Democrats set their eyes on November and the midterm election push to regain control of the House of Representatives, the long-term goal of ensuring a Democrat resides in the Oval Office in 2020 remains the party’s glaring concern – as well as where Soros will lend his financial support.

Soros expressed displeasure with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., for her use of the #MeToo movement that led to the removal of Al Franken from Congress.

“She was using #MeToo to promote herself,” he told the paper.

Although neither Gillibrand nor her aides have confirmed or denied that she is going to make a presidential run, there are reports of extensive fundraising as well as her outreach to young people and communities of color that play well with one of the most serious anti-Trump voting records in the Senate.

Soros has contributed upwards of $15 million to support Democrats in the midterm elections.

He told the paper that for every Trump supporter ""there is more than one Trump enemy who will be more intent, more determined.""

When asked about where he views his political ideology, Soros told The Times “I’m opposed to the extreme left,” he said.

“It should stop trying to keep up with the extremists on the right.”"

And the mainstream media is certainly doing its part to steer the narrative as part of a larger agenda, using plenty of misinformation along the way.

The following are among the most commonly parroted lies about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that aim to distort the facts and deceive you into believing falsehoods about this pandemic:

Media LIE: The virus is not man-made

From the very beginning of this thing, the official narrative was that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) came from a Chinese wet market where bats and other “exotic” animals are sold as meat. But the world later learned that it actually more than likely “escaped” from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

The mainstream media and social media platforms went nuts trying to censor this information and even called it “fake news.” But eventually it became undeniable that bat soup was not responsible for spreading the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) around Wuhan and eventually to the rest of the world – hence why we continue to call it the Wuhan coronavirus rather than just COVID-19.

We have even seen attempts by the media machine at making the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) a racial issue because there are supposedly more “people of color” coming down with it than people with fair skin, which further detracts attention away from the source of this virus.

The minute that President Donald Trump announced that hydroxychloroquine may be an effective, and very inexpensive, remedy for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the mainstream media immediately began decrying this claim as fake news, even though Anthony Fauci himself praised hydroxychloroquine back in 2013 under Barack Obama as being some type of “miracle cure” for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).

There have even been studies conducted that were designed to intentionally smear the drug as both ineffective and dangerous, though one in particular purposely left out zinc, which appears to be a critical co-factor in supporting the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine – in other words, politics as usual.

Media LIE: Only a vaccine can save us from coronavirus

Many politicians and public health officials are parroting the lie that the only way America can come out of lockdown and go back to “normal” is to get vaccinated with some future vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that does not even yet exist. A vaccine, we are repeatedly told, is the only thing, or perhaps some new “blockbuster” antiviral drug, that can cure the world of this scourge and make everything happy and wonderful once again.

Meanwhile, not a peep is being made about things like intravenous (IV) high-dose vitamin C, which is being successfully used in other countries to stem the tide of infections without the need for new drugs and vaccines.

Speaking of natural approaches to overcoming the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that are being systematically ignored by the mainstream media and most in politics, have you heard anyone mention the importance of nutrition in all of this? We did not think so, and this is intentional.

Regular readers of this site over the years should know by now that the single-most important thing you need to do to stay healthy besides exercising regularly is to feed your body the nutrition it needs to naturally ward off illnesses, including those associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Research compiled by the Lewin Group reveals that nutritional remedies such as calcium, vitamin D, folate, omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, zeaxanthin, and more all play a critical role in fortifying the immune system, which, if properly nourished, should have little problem fending off disease.

Oh, and Trump is to blame for all the deaths

And last but certainly not least, there is the Blame Trump tactic. When all else fails, simply tack it all on to the Commander-in-Chief, whose lack of a formulated response, failure to follow Fauci’s recommendations, or whatever other excuse they can come up with is directly responsible for all of the deaths tied to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

It is interesting, to say the least, that this crisis emerged almost immediately following the multiple failed attempts by primarily leftists to oust President Trump from the White House on trumped-up impeachment charges. While some may not agree with Trump’s handling of this pandemic, he did leave it up to the states to formulate their own responses, which makes him anything but the tyrant that Democrats like to portray him as being.

As time goes on, this country is sure to see perpetually more societal fracturing as a result of these ever-present, Trump-hating narratives. At a time when the country should be joining together to resist all of the tyranny that is now coming our way as a result of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), left-right animosity is instead being employed as a desperate, last-ditch attempt to smear Trump in the leadup to the 2020 election.

Wanna know when the chemtrails are coming? Check your phone and look at the forecast.

Yes, the “weatherman” is in on it, folks, and they know the spray days. All to make it look “natural”.

See for yourself

 I checked my phone for the weather while walking under a clear blue sky in San Diego this morning. Sure enough, that nasty filmy cloud was over the sun on my iphone weather app.

Probably gonna be chemtrails today. It may turn out to be a real weather system coming in but let’s see what happens. It’s been clear a while and the chemtrails are overdue. They may also be laying low somewhat with the increased radioactivity from Japan, especially in the upper atmosphere.

We’ve had nice clear skies for partial days with the rains and wind clearing the air. We may have more moisture coming later as real clouds (which did happen) but too often this stringy cloud over the sun foretells chemtrails. Follow the weather and the forecasts closely and you’ll see this to be true. A perfectly blue sky with no real clouds nor reason for them will be turned into an overcast or partly overcast day, all by chemtrails, as you watch them sprayed in the sky, and you’ll see that forecasted on your phone.

They haven’t been able to spray for days so I know they’re itching to get their levels back up, so I decided to document it.

Today at 10:30 am it looked like this:



Nice. On the horizon just over the ocean, the natural look is a darkish haze from the pollution in the area. When that is white, it’s usually a bank of chemtrails coming in, unless it’s a real front, which is much less frequent. Looks so far like they haven’t started spraying, but they could be out there. I see it happen a lot.

2 hours later I checked outside at 12:30, and this crap is over our heads. It even has that telltale evil HAARPed out pattern as well. (This came in before a bank of real clouds followed later on its heels.)

Thinking HAARP’s active is never a comforting thought, especially with the Pacific Ring of Fire seeing so much activity.

These only appear periodically, but they do appear, sometimes also displaying the rainbow colors but always in an odd shape.

Same time as the above shot.

Stock up with Fresh Food that lasts with eFoodsDirect (AD)

One of their ploys is to lay the banks of chemtrails way out at sea and float them on shore, so they appear to be natural weather changes. You can spot the tell-tale signs that these are chemtrail or chemtrail augmented clouds, especially the clear spray of filthy chemicals in the above left.

Chemtrails do attract water vapor under certain conditions and sometimes morph into more natural looking formations, almost like a disguise. Sometimes, however, there’s not a lick of moisture and it’s just horrible cross patterns as they fill in from what they started out at sea, and then spread out to cover the sky.

But keep looking–they’ll often separate out and you’ll see the chemicals dispersing at different rates force the chemtrails to give themselves away for the death dealing crap that they are.

 Try to tell me this one I just shot is “natural”….

They don’t spray during windy days over about 25mph, although they do spray above clouds, snow and rain. Just wait for a break in the clouds and check for the trails.

Here along the coast we’ll have coastal fog and it’ll clear to an absolute mess they’ve been spewing for hours. (coastal fog clearing lower left and bottom center. 2 days ago)

So, the weatherman is in on it?

It it any wonder, when Raytheon is involved.

All weather forecasting and reporting is now routed through this central Raytheon system. No wonder the weatherman won’t say a peep about chemtrails and they so often don’t even show up on TV radar–it’s doctored. Chemtrails and their cover up is a concerted, military controlled effort. Welcome to Orwellia.

And no wonder they’re also involved with HAARP. Nice one-two punch. The military industrial complex rolls on.

More on Raytheon, HAARP, Chemtrails and the Weather

These are nasty people, mad military fake scientists experimenting with our planet and its people.

 Keep exposing them. The darkness cannot stand the light.

Hats off to Dane Wigington for the amazing presentation.

Dane Wigington presents hard data which reveals what these catastrophic programs have done to our planet to date and what they will do if they are allowed to continue. Please take the time to watch this video, follow up with some investigation of your own on our site — http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org, and share this information far and wide.

This video presentation discusses the reality of weather modification and global warming.



This video helps us understand the difference between normal jet engine “condensation” trails (and “chemtrails” (which everybody has seen, often without recognition), which last for hours, dispersing slowly into a silvery hazy.

This video comes from www.geoengineeringwatch.org.

People who see with their own eyes the obvious evidence that is so easily obtained online and still try to discredit the truth as only a “conspiracy theory” are, according to the narrator, either in denial, seriously ignorant, clinically blind, psychopathic or paid liars trying to cover up for the evil entities (mostly governmental or corporate) that are causing and covering-up the problems.

Meteorologists appear to have been instructed to avoid this important subject, even when they predict clear skies the next day and then those with eyes to see, observe the spraying that artificially creates a thin cloud-like haze.

For another perspective on Chemtrails:

Pope Francis reportedly invited a group known as “Aqua Circus,” Europe’s response to “Cirque du Soleil,” to dance around on stage and pay homage to the reptile “jesus” idol perched up in a display behind him.

During this postlude to Rome’s General Audience event, Francis tossed a hula hoop to the “artists” in the performance troupe who were acting out a tale about a mermaid and a man under the sea trying to fight contamination of the ocean. In other words, the purpose of the show was to offer worship to Francis’ god of global warming and climate change.

In the below video footage, watch as creepy Francis smirks with satisfaction at the pagan performance happening right in front of him. And keep in mind that Vatican Hall itself is shaped like a giant serpent, both inside and out (pictures of Vatican Hall are available at Now The End Begins):

Is Pope Francis the false prophet eagerly awaiting his antichrist’s rise from the ashes?

As you’ll notice, the overtly satanic imagery was everywhere at this spectacle. Besides the shape and design of Vatican Hall, which is clearly meant to resemble a snake – think Garden of Eden if you’re missing the insinuation, here – the dancers, which looked like a bunch of ambiguously adorned drag queens, further represent the new race of genderless, sexless cyborg beings that will populate the New World Order.

This is what the satanic Baphomet image is supposed to represent, in case you didn’t know: a part male, part female, part animal, part artificial intelligence (AI) robot being that will exist as earth’s new race of fake humans once the LGBTQP agenda is fully implemented.

And how about that creepy “art” image of fake jesus rising from an “atomic apocalypse” behind Francis the entire time? This 1977 creation by Pericle Fazzini depicts the false messiah rising from the ashes after what would seem to be a catastrophic global disaster of some kind.

If you look closely at the fake jesus in Fazzini’s statue creation, you’ll see that he’s been given a reptile head, further revealing this creepy to be that of Satan himself, and certainly not the real Jesus.

“In the Bible, Satan is pictured as a reptile who will have a coming war with King Jesus at the Battle of Armageddon at the Second Coming,” writes Geoffrey Grider for Now the End Begins, about which side of the battle Roman Catholicism has embraced.

“Revelation shows us that the Genesis serpent had an ‘upgrade’ along the way and now is a giant, red-headed multi-headed dragon, though still a reptile.”

Whether you personally believe in all of this or not is irrelevant, because Roman Catholics and Francis certainly do. And it’s all coming to pass just as the Bible said it would, with Francis vying for the false prophet position in this apocalyptic narrative.

Keep in mind that the climate change narrative being pushed by Francis and his ilk is a religion in and of itself, and one that requires worship in the form of not eating meat, not using fossil fuels, and embracing the LGBTQP “rainbow” as the new global standard for civilization – just like Sodom and Gomorrah, and we all know what happened to those places.

“The Vatican loves dead things, and creepy things, and perverted things,” Grider also notes. “Things like the circus that Pope Francis invited to the reptilian Audience Hall on January 8, 2020.”"

President Barack Obama was so eager to undermine U.S. and Israeli national security that he would do anything — quite literally — to make his “nuclear deal” with Iran.

That included violating U.S. sanctions and other statutes by secretly giving the terrorist-sponsoring Iranians access to the U.S. financial system after he and his sycophantic staffers repeatedly lied to Congress and the American people that no such access would ever be granted.

The Associated Press reported details of the latest example of why Obama was the most corrupt president in our history:

After striking an elusive nuclear deal with Iran, the Obama administration found itself in a quandary in early 2016: Iran had been promised access to its long-frozen overseas reserves, including $5.7 billion stuck in an Omani bank.

To spend it, Iran wanted to convert the money into U.S. dollars and then euros, but top U.S. officials had repeatedly promised Congress that Iran would never gain access to America’s financial system.

Those assurances notwithstanding, the Obama administration secretly issued a license to let Iran sidestep U.S. sanctions for the brief moment required to convert the funds through an American bank, an investigation by Senate Republicans released Wednesday showed. The plan failed when two U.S. banks refused to participate.

Any liberal who still believes that banks are more dishonest than Obama needs to read that last sentence. (Related: Israeli PM Netanyahu drops bombshell; reveals 100,000-plus Iranian documents proving Obama-era “nuclear deal” built on “lies”.)

In any event, this revelation underscores previous assertions that the 44th president was only too eager to make a deal with a sworn enemy that would put Americans and our allies in the Middle East and Europe in greater danger. Because after learning this — and learning recently that Obama’s Marxist secretary of state, John Kerry, was secretly working behind the scenes to sabotage President Donald Trump’s efforts to withdraw from the nuclear agreement — who honestly believes that the “deal” would really have stopped the Iranians from getting nuclear weapons? Because Obama said so?

Obama sycophants try covering for him

“The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran,” said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who chairs the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which conducted the probe, according to the AP.

GOP Rep. Ed Royce of California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that Obama undertook an effort to “hide a secret push to give the ayatollah access to the U.S. dollar.”

Naturally, former Obama officials are disputing the findings. They claim that in the ‘spirit of the deal’ it was perfectly normal and okay for Obama to give Iran access to our financial system — so they could get their hands on billions of dollars with which to use to ramp up their weapons programs and terrorist sponsorship.

“They continue to malign the deal in an effort to justify President Trump’s unjustifiable decision,” Ned Price, Obama’s White House National Security Council spokesman, in a reference to the GOP, told the AP.

Consider: If this little side deal was so ‘in the spirit’ of things and on the up-and-up, 1) Why did two U.S. banks refuse to go along will giving Iran access to U.S. dollars? and 2) Why was Congress repeatedly lied to about it?

As it turns out, the conversion never took place — at least via U.S. means. The Senate report says that the Iranians were able to convert the money, which was held in Omani banks in rials, notoriously difficult to convert, using other currencies besides the dollar.

And issuing the license wasn’t against the law, per se. But, as the AP noted, “it went above and beyond what the Obama administration was required to do under the terms of the nuclear agreement, in which the U.S. and world powers gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program.”

834,True,The article presents a conspiracy theory that President Trump is working with Big Pharma to distribute untested and unsafe vaccines to the American people for profit and to boost the stock market.,True,"The article mentions President Trump, Big Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, and Moncef Slaoui as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,The article describes the actions of President Trump and Big Pharma in distributing untested and unsafe vaccines and using the military to force vaccinate the American people.,True,The article suggests that the forced vaccination program poses a threat to the American people and describes it as risky and unsafe.,True,"The article connects events and observations to support the conspiracy theory, such as the involvement of the military, the use of RFID tracking, and the potential enforcement of immunity passports.",False,The article does not mention any attempts to mislead or cover up information.,"Trump is about to name a “vaccine czar” to run “Operation Warp Speed,” a fast-track scheme to distribute 300 million untested, unsafe vaccines across America before the end of the year. The person being named to the position is a former executive with GlaxoSmithKline, a criminal corporation that admitted to a large-scale felony bribery scheme in its $3 billion settlement with the DOJ. GSK’s bribery scheme involved 44,000 doctors and violated the laws of every state in the nation.

With no qualms about doing business with corporate felons, President Trump is now jumping in bed with Big Pharma criminals to turn the American people into human guinea pigs in order to push Big Pharma profits and try to boost the stock market in time for the November elections. And instead of choosing to work with a corporation that has no criminal record, he chose the vaccine maker that has the worst criminal record across the entire vaccine industry.

With no qualms about doing business with corporate felons, President Trump is now jumping in bed with Big Pharma criminals to turn the American people into human guinea pigs in order to push Big Pharma profits and try to boost the stock market in time for the November elections. And instead of choosing to work with a corporation that has no criminal record, he chose the vaccine maker that has the worst criminal record across the entire vaccine industry.

Moncef Slaoui, a former GlaxoSmithKline executive, will lead “Operation Warp Speed,” Trump’s push to accelerate the vaccine development process for COVID-19, according to an administration official. Slaoui is to serve in a volunteer capacity, and will be assisted by Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the commander of United States Army Materiel Command.

If you’re wondering why a US Army general is getting involved with the GlaxiSmithKline vaccine push, it’s because Trump has just announced he’s going to “rapidly mobilize” the US military to distribute the vaccine, according to CBS News:

“We’re mobilizing our military and other forces but we’re mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine. You know, it’s a massive job to give this vaccine. Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we’re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly,” the president said

It’s quite clear that Trump is describing a military-run forced vaccination program that involves mandatory injections, “to a lot of people very, very rapidly.”

Why would the US military be required to distribute a vaccine? Because, of course, the vaccine won’t be optional. President Trump is going to use the United States military to force vaccinate millions of Americans against their will. Trump has sold out America and is now going to turn the American people into live human guinea pigs for Big Pharma’s mad vaccine experiments. The entire “Operation Warp Speed” scheme is about skipping safety tests and clinical trials in order to roll out a risky, untested, unsafe vaccine that will be injected into you at gunpoint.

That’s why the military is about to be deployed across the United States to administer vaccines.

Trump has betrayed his nation and the American people. He is now an agent of Big Pharma and the anti-human rights vaccine industry that uses human children for medical experiments, all around the world.

It won’t be just any normal vaccine, either. Yesterday the Dept. of Defense issued a press release celebrating its effort to acquire 500 million “ApiJect” vaccine injection devices to be ready for the coronavirus vaccine.

As described on the ApiJect website, the ApiJect syringe features RFID tracking and GPS geo-location combined with medical data sharing with a government cloud:

With an optional RFID/NFC tag on each BFS prefilled syringe, ApiJect will make this possible. Before giving an injection, the healthcare worker will be able to launch a free mobile app and “tap” the prefilled syringe on their phone, capturing the NFC tag’s unique serial number, GPS location and date/time. The app then uploads the data to a government-selected cloud database. Aggregated injection data provides health administrators an evolving real-time “injection map.”

So the military will be “mobilized” across America to administer forced vaccines that are tagged with RFID and GPS location data, linked to your personal identification and synced with a government database that will of course be used very soon to enforce “immunity passports” and other Bill Gatesian ideas rooted in medical tyranny.

Are you getting the picture yet?

According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Justice Department is about to indict and prosecute Julian Assange, a journalist whose life has already been destroyed through his “imprisonment” in an Ecuadorian embassy for the last six years.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, a traitorous political mafia boss who sold out America’s strategic uranium supply to enemies while collecting “speaking fee” bribes from international oligarchs, is apparently not being prosecuted by anyone at all.

If anyone should go free today, it’s Julian Assange. And if anyone should be indicted and prosecuted for serious crimes, it’s Hillary Clinton. Yet, as the WSJ reports:

U.S. prosecutors have discussed several types of charges they could potentially bring against Mr. Assange… The exact charges Justice Department might pursue remain unclear, but they may involve the Espionage Act, which criminalizes the disclosure of national defense-related information.

The difference between Julian Assange and Hillary Clinton

Julian Assange is committed to transparency and truth. Hillary Clinton is committed to cover-ups and lies.

Julian Assange went public with damning evidence of America’s treachery to try to make it stop. Hillary Clinton destroyed damning evidence and magnified America’s treachery to try to make it worse.

Julian Assange would do anything just to breathe fresh air again and walk in a public park. Hillary Clinton would do anything to suffocate America’s freedoms and seize authoritarian power over the entire nation.

Julian Assange wants people to live (and learn, and awaken). Hillary Clinton wants people to DIE (and sleep with the fishes).

When peoples’ lives are at stake, Julian Assange goes public with important information to keep people informed. But when lives are at stake in the Middle East, Hillary Clinton pretends a terrorist attack isn’t happening and refuses to send aid, making sure U.S. soldiers and ambassadors get murdered by a lunatic mob. Then she blames someone else for the entire thing with a made-up story of pure fiction. Coincidentally, that’s exactly how Robert Mueller operates, too.

Julian Assange exposed the truth about the DNC. Hillary Clinton hid the truth (about Benghazi and much more) and has peddled nothing but lies for the last three decades.

Julian Assange located dark secrets and exposed them to the public in the name of transparency. Hillary Clinton took public truths and buried them inside layers of dark secrets in the name of deception and treason.

Julian Assange is a well-meaning man with a deep commitment to share the truth. Hillary Clinton is a vindictive, vicious woman with a deep commitment to making sure anyone who opposes her ends up in a body bag.

Julian Assange has been imprisoned in an embassy building for six years, unable to go outside for fear of being arrested. Hillary Clinton has been free to continue committing serious international crimes of corruption and campaign finance fraud, right out in public, with zero fear of being arrested or stopped because the entire judicial system treats her as someone is it above the law.

Julian Assange dared to release truthful information that exposed the deep deception and electoral fraud taking place inside the DNC to make sure Hillary got the nomination. Hillary Clinton destroyed 30,000+ emails on her illegal server to make sure no one would ever find out how she betrayed America to seize power at any cost.

If anyone should be indicted right now, it’s Hillary Clinton.

Lock her up. And pardon Julian Assange in exchange for him sharing everything he has on the Clintons and the DNC."
837,True,The passage suggests that health technocrats are stuck in a time capsule and are battling a terrible pathogen from the past.

How else to explain why they have adopted precisely the public health tactics — masking, social distancing, and quarantining — that were used in 1918?

Our wildly anachronistic approach to COVID 19 notwithstanding, we have spent billions for research and know volumes more about viruses and immunity than we did a century ago. The crime is that we the taxpaying public never received a proper education on the subject. I realized that myself 20 years ago when I first read J. R. Paul’s A History of Poliomyelitis. It quietly reveals that almost none of what we have learned in American public schools is even close to the truth.

More importantly, the deep knowledge of viruses garnered from studying both the original H1N1 flu and polio strongly implies that, if we continue to over-react and over-protect people from COVID 19, we risk turning it into a much more lethal virus. In order to understand why I am so concerned about that, first let’s look at how the original flu virus turned into the worst killer the world has ever known, one which not only felled older people and those with weakened immunity, but people in the prime of life including older children and young adults:

1) In general, viruses evolve with their human hosts to get what they need without killing us. Allowing us to survive actually benefits the virus — they get to survive, too, and get passed to another human host.

2) During WWI, millions of people globally were terrified, malnourished and immuno-suppressed.

3) Soldiers lay in foxholes bleeding, coughing and vomiting on each other.

An investigation by the British Medical Journal has exposed a horrifying vaccine scam that took place in the same place that many unethical vaccine stories come from – Africa. There, babies were used as guinea pigs to test out a vaccine after the monkeys it was tested on died.

According to the report, nearly 1,400 infants in South Africa were given an experimental vaccine for tuberculosis by academics from Oxford University that was linked to monkey fatalities in tests. In an informational paper issued to the parents of the babies who got the jab back in 2009, it is claimed that the vaccine was “shown to be safe and effective” despite the fact that five out of six monkeys in the trial became so ill that they had to be put down.

While none of the babies were believed to be harmed by the vaccine, it did not provide them with any protection from tuberculosis, leading one to wonder why they were subjected to such a dangerous shot in the first place.

Oxford dropped the vaccine eventually, but they insist the results of the monkey studies were supplied to regulators in South Africa, the U.S., and the U.K. ahead of the trial. In addition, they say it was tested on 400 teens, adults, and children in South Africa, Gambia and the U.K. before being given to the babies. Is that supposed to be comforting?

According to McGill University’s Jonathan Kimmelman, this type of incident is far too common. He told The Daily Mail: “It’s widely recognized that animal studies intended to support drug development are often riddled with flaws in design and reporting. Unfortunately, there are other cases where new treatments were put into human testing on animal evidence that was foreseeably flawed, incomplete, or even negative.”

According to the World Health Organization, tuberculosis is one of the top 10 killers in the world today. 2016 saw 10.4 million cases of the illness and 1.7 million fatalities overall. Children accounted for a million of the illnesses and 250,000 of the deaths.

More than 95 percent of tuberculosis cases and fatalities take place in developing countries. While India has the biggest TB problem, African nations like Nigeria and South Africa also rank in the top seven. This disease, which spreads easily through the air from person to person, is both preventable and curable.

A similar scandal is taking place in three other African countries – Ghana, Malawi, and Kenya, where clinical trials of the first malaria vaccine in the world are set to take place despite concerns about being able to give children the shots on the right schedule and major reservations regarding its efficacy. The program is connected to Bill Gates, who has made no secret of his depopulation aspirations. That fact alone should give everyone serious pause.

If these African experiments sound outrageous to you, consider this: The same thing happens even in the world’s most advanced nations. Babies are regularly given shots that have killed others, and countless people line up every year to get flu shots that are highly ineffective. Those who make money from the shots will continue to make excuses for their inefficacy and explain away the deaths they cause, pressuring governments and media outlets to help them spread their message. As long as vaccines continue to be profitable, this problem is not going to go away any time soon.

The poll founds that 14% were not interested at all, and 10% were not very interested in the vaccine.

However, while that 24% dismissed the idea, two thirds, 66%, said they are either “very” or “somewhat” interested in taking a vaccine when it is produced.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” adding “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The Reuters report notes that health experts believe “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine noted that “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll also found that 36% of respondents would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe, with just 14% said they would be interested.

A week ago, Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” to fast-track the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021, tapping experts and resources in science, medicine, the military, and the private sector.

Trump has said that the military will be deployed to distribute the vaccine, but has suggested that it will remain voluntary, noting that it will be for those “who want to get it,” and “Not everyone is going to want to get it.”

Remember him? Splish...splash...splosh....gurgle... He's up! He's down! Finally, the instructor takes pity and hauls him closer into the shallow end. For a time, despite significant rescue attempts, it seemed as though the dollar might actually be allowed to sail under 82.00. Then, just like a clock, on Friday the dollar straightened out and held the line....at 83.00. Precisely, too - not 82.99 and not 83.01. Precisely, exactly 83.00 was its close. What a coincidence! I must be psychotic. Or is that psychic? I keep confusing the two. With all American markets up somewhat and, despite steady gains in recent days, both gold and silver solidly took it on the chin Friday, unaccountably (unless you account for market rigging, of course) plunging $7.10 and $.26 per ounce, respectively, on the day's trading, where they now sit until the overseas market opens again, late tomorrow. Ever since Henry Paulsen took office as Treasury Secretary, market manipulation now takes place with no regard to either common decency or legality. No longer does there seem to be any pretense that ""they"" are not rigging the markets. After all, what are we going to do about it? Call it the Bush doctrine all over again, just being employed in the financial world. Did you notice that the major brokerage firms recently reported record profits yet again? Not hard when you know, each and every day, exactly what the markets will do. Tell me exactly the figure at which the S&P index will close each day for the next month and, starting with $1,000, I will round out the month being worth more than Bill Gates. Their only danger is in making too much money, of course. We have a saying here in North Idaho: Pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered. I was amused recently to read in one on-line forum how one fellow who holds himself out as an expert in all things financial literally laughed at my assumption that these markets are being manipulated. Why, even the mainstream media now talks openly about the rigging. When MSNBC's commentators dare to mention the Plunge Protection Team, as many have in recent weeks, the fix has become so institutionalized that, next, I would not be surprised to see it made into a cabinet post. The Secretary of Investment Security, perhaps, in the modern Orwellian fashion that has the Secretary of Defense making war and the Department of Homeland Security, based upon results, intent upon making Americans feel anything but secure. So, it appears that the dollar's new reality has become 83.00, a commonly-reported index composed of six foreign currencies, just as I cautioned more than once recently. Next will come 82.00, of course, then 81.00. Where will the dollar index be when the global dominoes all fall down? We won't notice or care, so distracting will WWIII have become by then. I do know the dollar's ultimate destination, however: Zero. By then, we will have been switched over to the Amero, with the all-digital Globo then being openly discussed as the Amero's replacement. Read my book for the gory details and how to keep from becoming a part of the statistical nightmare now shaping up. What escapes one's attention by focusing upon that index, however, is that all western fiat currencies (which means all Western currencies, of course) are being inflated like there is no tomorrow. The dollar's apparent decline merely is against some of those currencies. Nor can we get an accurate handle on how quickly all the currencies are plunging in buying power, due to the worldwide rigging of markets; just that the dollar is moving a bit faster than the others. Without paper gold and paper silver, which is all that futures and options on them really are (and which I increasingly suspect ETFs like GLD and SLV have become, given the nagging rumors of their having leased out their gold and silver, just as did most central banks long ago), the prices of both now would be in orbit, if not well on their way to the Moon, their inevitable destination. Here, let me say it one more time: Cash in your GLD and SLV and buy the real thing. Holding ETFs is the same thing as playing musical chairs, with only a fraction of the necessary chairs available for those circling the room. Had you switched over just a couple of weeks ago, Friday's decline notwithstanding, already you would have recovered the commission incurred in making the conversion. I still have not entirely followed my own advice, in case that somehow reassures you. Call it lethargy or an attempt to bottom fish or whatever. Regardless, it is foolish. See? I readily admit to it. Don't dare even mention stocks or bonds to me. Holding equities today is beyond foolish and can best be described as downright stupid. My name is Edgar J. Steele.

 Helium-3 is a gas that can be used in various fields. For example, it could be used as a fuel for nuclear power plants as well as in cryogenics and medicine.

Using the largest antenna of NASA’s Madrid Deep Space Communication Complex, researchers discovered vast helium-3 reserves in space.

The researchers analyzed the relevant data and proved that helium-3 is produced in the center of stars and is ejected into space at the end of their lives. For example, scientists say that after several billion years the Sun will begin to eject the gas as well.

The discovery was made by researchers from the University of Manchester, UK, the Centro de Astrobiología and the Deep Space Network, Spain and the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.

A full report on the study is published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Earlier in May we heard how huge mining operations are planned to take place on the moon in an attempt to source helium-3:

‘Indian scientists working tirelessly on Mine the Moon for Helium-3’

Renowned defence technologist A. Sivathanu Pillai, said Indian scientists were working tirelessly to mine the moon for Helium-3, which could be used in nuclear reactors to provide enormous amount of power without any harmful carbon emissions or radioactive products.

He was addressing the gathering of academicians and research students at the two-day National level Conference on Science, Engineering and Technology (NCSET–2016) organised by School of Electronics Engineering, VIT University, Chennai campus on Monday.

In his plenary address, he urged the students to pursue research-oriented subjects. He said, currently, a number of global scientists, including those from India were working on International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor and their focus was to develop a fusion reactor that used helium 3 and deuterium. Interestingly, the solar winds have helium, but our atmosphere absorbs it.

Mr. Pillai exuded confidence that high availability of thorium — India accounts for one-third of world reserves — would enable the country to achieve the target of 40,000 MW nuclear power generation by 2020."

It could drive suicide, drug, and alcohol deaths as high as 150,000, according to new research released by Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care.

Projections of additional “deaths of despair” range from 27,644, assuming a quick economic recovery and the smallest impact from unemployment, to 154,037, assuming a slow recovery and the most significant impact from unemployment. The researchers wrote in the “deaths of despair” report published last Friday:

“We can prevent these deaths by taking meaningful and comprehensive action as a nation.” “More Americans could lose their lives to deaths of despair, deaths due to drug, alcohol, and suicide, if we do not do something immediately.” “Deaths of despair have been on the rise for the last decade, and in the context of COVID-19, deaths of despair should be seen as the epidemic within the pandemic.”

As of Sunday in the United States, 8.7 million people had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, with 1,283,929 confirmed cases. The epicenter of the pandemic remains in New York state, with 26,535 deaths. Worldwide, there were 4,081,970 confirmed cases and 281,399 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

President Donald Trump has frequently warned that efforts to stem the rapid spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, are spiraling the economy into another Great Recession. Trump recently told ABC News about his decision to reopen the economy, saying:

Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer at the Well Being Trust, said the federal government must fully support and invest in a plan to improve mental-health care, adding:

The Well Being Trust is a national foundation dedicated to advancing the mental, social, and spiritual health of the nation. The Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care is an independent research unit affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians, and works to improve individual and population health by enhancing the delivery of primary care.

The researchers issued a warning for the months and even years ahead, arguing for additional investment in health care and strategies to deal with the phenomenon. They wrote:

“A preventable surge of avoidable deaths from drugs, alcohol, and suicide is ahead of us if the country does not begin to invest in solutions that can help heal the nation’s isolation, pain, and suffering.” “SARS CoV-2 is having an unprecedented impact on the world. No one alive can recall any infection or worldwide event of such magnitude and scale. Along with the tens of thousands of deaths in the United States from the virus, COVID-19 overlays the growing epidemic of deaths of despair threatening to make an already significant problem even worse.”

Approximately 134,000 people in the U.S. could die from COVID-19, more than double an estimate five weeks ago of 72,000, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. According to Market Watch, that projection is watched closely by the White House and could go as high as 243,000, taking into account the institute’s margin of error.

The debate over the ramifications of a months-long shutdown of the American economy has been both emotional and sobering. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for more than three decades and one of the leading experts in the U.S. on infectious diseases, has pleaded with people to “socially distance.”

The debate over the economy’s survival vs. the public health emergency highlights, as well, the gap between left and right on the American political spectrum. The left generally believes that strong social structures support a stronger economy for all. The right traditionally follows the idea that a strong economic system supports strong social structures for all.

It also mentions previous instances of Facebook hiring right-wing groups for opposition research on George Soros.",False,The article does not mention any attempts by the actors to mislead or cover up information.,"Facebook is now partnering with another George Soros-funded ""fact-checker"" that will be employed to filter out posts from its News Feed that it deems to be ""fake news.""

The UK-based organization, Full Fact, describes itself as a ""charity"" and will review stories, images, and videos and rate them based on accuracy before filtering out ""misinformation"" on a global level, according to the BBC.

Despite the organization claiming to be non-partisan, it has received extensive funding from the liberal financier, and major Democratic Party donor, George Soros.

And this isn't the first time that a Soros-funded group has become of ""Facebook's official fact-checking partners.""

In October 2018, Facebook partnered with African ""fact-checker"" AfricaCheck, that claims to ""combat fake news and false information on the social platform.""

The organization, that claims to be - yes, you guessed it - ""non-partisan,"" says its role is to ""promote accuracy in public debate and the media in Africa.""

Although the group ""fact-checks"" information related to Africa, it also ""debunks"" international news stories, and once an article is flagged by them as being ""false,"" it's pulled from the Facebook's News Feed on a global level, not just limited to users in Africa.

Aside from 9 percent of its funding coming from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, AfricaCheck gets 21 percent of its income from George Soros' Open Society Foundation.

The organization's largest donor, with 29 percent of the funding, however, comes from the Shuttleworth Foundation, a South African group with ties to Soros' Open Society.

Surely, Facebook must vet their ""non-bias"" partners, so how could this publically-available information simply slip through the net?

According to NewsBusters, the “charity” Full Fact was announced on January 11 as the new fact-checkers for Facebook.

The BBC reports that the organization will “review stories, images, and videos and rate them based on accuracy.”

But these fact-checkers might have a bigger agenda, according to their funding page.

Google and liberal billionaire George Soros have donated extensively to Full Fact in 2018 alone. It is also funded by a radical leftist, Pierre Omidyar, who funds the Never Trump site the Bulwark, headed by Bill Kristol.

Perhaps the move was meant to placate Soros, whose organizations, including the Color of Change, have lobbied to have Facebook undergo a civil rights audit.

Facebook has been under fire following the New York Times report, which said that Facebook hired a right-wing group to do opposition research on Soros.

However, there are no conservative fact-checkers left in the Facebook fact-checking family.

With the close of the Weekly Standard, Facebook has yet to name a conservative successor to fact-check.

While Full Fact strenuously objects to any criticism regarding partisan politics, it wrote on its website, “Ultimately, it is for our audience to judge for themselves whether we succeed.”

That equals $269,175, plus an additional $25,581.

Open Society Foundations, funded by George Soros, (who has called for Facebook to be split up), donated 71,917 pounds, or $91,987.

The lead editor at Full Fact is Tom Phillips, formerly editor at Buzzfeed UK.

Phillips had written extensively on the alt-right at Buzzfeed, and wrote a piece about the 2016 American election (despite being in the U.K.)

In that piece, he referred to the race as a “churning hellscape,” and shared a picture of a weeping woman with the caption, “It’s okay. We can get through this nightmare together! Grab your favorite crying pillow.”

Other probably well-checked pieces written by Phillips include, “What Actual Pile of Garbage Are You?”, “35 Ways of Describing Brexit, Ranked By How Much They Sound Like Sex Things,” and the extremely factual “How to Talk to A Woman Even Though She’s A Ghost.”

According to Wired, pieces that have been determined to be “fake news” by Full Fact will not be deleted, but they will be “shown lower in users’ news feeds, a move intended to decrease the number of people who end up seeing the content.”

Conservatives have gotten slammed by Facebook’s fact-checkers in the past, including a clearly marked satirical piece from the Babylon Bee about CNN’s “spin cycle washing machine” that was marked “fake news.”

A former editor of left-wing ""fact-checker"" Snopes also claimed in a December interview with the Guardian that Facebook pays the company to push ""propaganda.""

Pope Francis is working frantically to usher in the One World Religion, and is experiencing success on a level not seen by any pope since Constantine. In just 2019 alone, Pope Francis has created the official Chrislam logo, signed a covenant of ‘human fraternity and world peace‘, and then commissioned a committee called the Catholic-Muslim Interfaith Council to make it all a reality. Within mere months, that committee announced the opening in 2022 of the Abrahamic Family House, on the Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi. Wow, but after all that, Pope Francis now shows us he was just getting warmed up. Last month, he lead a worship service at the Vatican where be blessed the goddess Pachamama, the ‘mother of all the earth’.

“And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.” Revelation 17:4, 5 (KJV)

Pope Francis enraged Catholics worldwide by holding this pagan ceremony at the Vatican, under the thinly-veiled guise of it being part of the Synod of Bishops on the Amazon. It wasn’t, it was a trial balloon to see how much he could get away with. Astoundingly, when some irate Catholics got angry and threw the pagan statues into the river, Pope Francis ordered that the stature be fished out and return to its display area at the Vatican.

Pope Francis for many years now has preached the gospel of the New Age, has led multiple services for ‘Mother Earth’ , and kisses the feet of statues and prays to dead people. So this addition of Pachamama and the mother goddess is right up his alley. You can just smell the sulphur wafting out of Rome, can’t you?

FROM GLORIA TV: For Archbishop Viganó this is consistent with Francis’ aberrant Abu Dhabi declaration that alleges that “God wills all religions.” Viganó observes that Francis personally practiced the Pachamama cult in the Vatican gardens, in St Peter’s Basilica and during the Synod closing Mass by placing an idolatrous plant on the altar.

He calls this Pachamama show “an initiatory rite of the new religion” in order to align the Church with anti-human and anti-Christian strategies that dominate the globalist scene and are supported by those in power.

According to Viganò, a “satanic plan” is unfolding to change the Catholic religion, and Francis “serves as a catwalk to ferry what remains of the Catholic edifice towards an indistinct Universal Religion” and a “worldwide and stateless Pantheon.” READ MORE

In order to deceive the faithful, it was labelled as “Consecration of the Amazon Synod to Saint Francis.”

The mumbo-jumbo started with a dance around a blanket, placed on the lawn and symbolising “Mother Earth.” In the middle of the blanket were the statues of two naked woman and a statue of a man with an erection.

Pope Francis sat nearby surrounded by cardinals, bishops, and normal people. He closed his eyes as if he were “praying”. Finally, the shaman shook a rattle, went up to Francis and fooled him by casting some spells on his hands. READ MORE

The march is the latest in a series of high profile demonstrations to show solidarity between the British left and the Hamas ruled territory.

“And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Genesis 12:3

The protest is being organised by the Stop the War Coalition, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and a number of Muslim groups. Last weekend they claimed to have marched 100,000 people from Trafalgar Square, past the Houses of Parliament and on to the Israeli Embassy.

It is unclear whether the groups involved can muster one million people, but the campaign against Operation Protective Edge is getting increasingly bitter. On Sunday, a pro-Israeli activist was attacked during a peaceful protest by Zionist groups, and others had abuse hurled at them in Arabic.

The pro-Palestinian protest in Paris last weekend turned into a full scale riot with property damaged and vehicles set alight. There are concerns that this protest may also turn violent, and there is likely to be a large police presence to contain it.

Veteran left-wing MP, who is known for his pro-Palestinian stance, George Galloway is likely to speak. Galloway shot to fame in America when he was accused of breaking sanctions against Iraq. He attended the senate hearing to defend himself by admitting that he did take money off businessmen who broke to sanctions but only to campaign against the harsh treatment of Saddam Hussein’s regime.

It is unclear how Zionist groups will respond to the protest but it is highly unlikely that Israel itself will loosen the pressure on Hamas. The Israeli Defence Force are determined to make it impossible for the terrorist group to fire any more missiles into their territory.

So far, well over a hundred rockets have been fired at Israel. One of them got so close to Ben Gurion Airport that a number of countries suspended flights to the country."

Armstrong explains, “There’s these people who keep saying the dollar is going to crash. If the dollar crashes, the world is happier and basically celebrating. You have half the U.S. debt equivalent in emerging market debt issued in dollars. If the dollar goes up, they are in trouble. Then you are going to see sovereign defaults. . . . The U.S. is not going to default, but as you start defaults elsewhere outside the country, it makes people begin to get concerned about sovereign debt. Sovereign debt is the worst of all. It’s not secured. If the U.S. government defaulted on its debt, what would happen? You cannot go down to the National Gallery and start lifting Picassos.”

So, a bond market crash is a distinct possibility? Armstrong says, “Yes. All these things are contagions. . . . The real risk is coming from Europe and Asia. That is the real risk. . . . There is no place to go but the dollar at this point.”

If and when a global collapse comes, it will come from China or Europe. Armstrong says, “Yes, because you don’t collapse the core economy. It’s always the peripheral coming in. It was the same thing in the Great Depression. It wasn’t the fact that the U.S. defaulted. The problem was the first bank that went down was in Austria, and it happened to be owned in part by the Rothschilds. When people hear a bank owned by the Rothschilds went down, people started to sell off all other banks. Then all the countries defaulted.”

Armstrong says there is going to be a major “monetary reform” in the not so distant future, and the U.S. will end up with a dollar for domestic use and a dollar used for international trade, sort of like a “domestic dollar” and an “international trade dollar.” Armstrong says, “Yes. All it is doing is replacing the dollar as the reserve currency. That would satisfy China and Russia, and it would simply be maintained by an international board. I strongly advise against the IMF. It’s way, way too corrupt.”

So, is gold a good asset to have with a coming currency reset? Armstrong says, “Yes, at that point, you are talking about a hedge against government. When you go through these monetary crises, effectively, all tangible assets rise in price, not just gold and silver. . . . Tangible assets have a value to everybody globally. The downside is on real estate. I would never put 100% of my money in real estate because it is not moveable.”

Fast-forward to now, and Armstrong predicts, “The economy is not going to come back. We are not going to see economic growth.”

Where is all this taking the world? Armstrong, who is an expert on economic and political cycles, says, “You have to understand what makes war even take place? It does not unfold when everybody is fat and happy. Simple as that. You turn the economy down, and that’s when you get war. It’s the way politics works.”

Given predictions of a 50% increase in the global influenza vaccine market by 2023 (from $5 billion to $7.5 billion), it would seem so. On the other hand, recent estimates of influenza vaccine coverage in U.S. adults show that Americans are growing more, rather than less, skeptical. In 2017-2018, influenza vaccine coverage fell for every adult age group (and all but one racial/ethnic group), reaching the lowest level in eight flu seasons. While influenza researchers may be “hesitant to discuss problems with the vaccine ‘because they’re afraid of being tainted with the antivaccine brush,’” the bottom line is flu shots are big business and vaccine injuries aren’t rare.

The CDC is touting (as you can imagine) the success of birth control. After all, they’ve spent decades as “pharma’s marketing voice.” But, what if something else more sinister is responsible for the lower birthrate?
• Gardasil: Don’t let your child become “one less”

According to Norma Erickson from SaneVax, the Gardasil vaccine being given to teens to “prevent” HPV might actually be causing infertility (among other things):

“I would suspect that quite a bit of it may be related to Gardasil, particularly since there have been campaigns targeting black, Hispanic and ‘at risk’ young women (those incarcerated) – coincidentally also those with the highest teen birth rates. I have personally spoken with a 17 year old California boy who after the second injection is impotent. He said one of his friends has the same problem, but is too embarrassed to speak of it (even to his parents). We are barely seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

According to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, Gardasil has been known to cause infertility in female mice and atrophy of the Leydig cells in male mice:
• Polysorbate 80 has been shown to .
• Rats injected with polysorbate 80 days 4 to 7 after birth have an accelerated maturation of the vagina and squamous metaplasia of the epithelial lining of the uterus, indicative of chronic estrogenic over stimulation.
• Ovaries were without corpora lutea and had degenerative follicles. (Reference: Gajdova M, Jakubovsky J, Valky J. “Delayed effects of neonatal exposure to Tween 80 on female reproductive organs in rats.” Food Chem Toxicol. 1993 Mar;31(3):183-90.)
• Sodium borate: The minimum concentration of borax that can induce complete germinal layer aplasia in the testicles is 6-8 ppm. Testicular concentrations were found to be higher than in the plasma.
• Gardasil has 35 mcg (35 ppm) per dose. (1 mcg ~ 1ppm). (Reference: Dixon, RL., et al. “Assessment of Environmental Factors Effecting Male Infertility.” Environ Health Persp. Vol 30. 1979 pp 53-68.)

But, given what we know Bill Gates has said before about vaccines helping to control population growth- how could we not question these numbers?

Chinese authorities plan to test all of Wuhan’s 11 million residents for Covid-19 in a little over a week. After more than a month without newly-recorded cases, the disease has suddenly reappeared in the city.

All districts in the city were ordered to submit a plan on how they will conduct testing of all residents in their areas within 10 days, local media reported, citing a document from the authorities. The officials were told to prioritize the testing of vulnerable groups and places like residential compounds.

The measure was announced as a response to the six new locally-transmitted cases that were recorded in Wuhan on Sunday and Monday, after no infections were registered for 35 consecutive days in the central Hubei Province, where Wuhan is the capital. All six new patients were living in the same compound.

Wuhan was the original epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak, and in late January, it became the first city to be placed under lockdown as the infection continued to spread. Similar restrictions were enacted in several other major cities in Hubei.

Through strict quarantine measures and mass testing, the authorities managed to bring down the number of newly-recorded cases in Wuhan to nearly zero. As the situation improved, the lockdown in Wuhan was lifted on April 8.

China is still reporting low numbers of newly-confirmed Covid-19 infections per day, with most new cases brought from overseas. On Monday, the nation’s health officials recorded one new case of the novel coronavirus and a one suspected case, and no deaths.

Overall, China has had over 84,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 4,600 people have died.

On one hand, it’s almost admirable that Mark Zuckerberg said he will continue to allow Holocaust deniers to have a forum on Facebook to spread their ignorant revisionist history. Free speech and all that, right? Yeah, but you’ll have to forgive me for not celebrating Zuckerberg’s dubious application of our First Amendment right.

The reason is because, as a publisher of Bible teaching articles and news from a Christian perspective, I use Facebook as my primary tool to share my articles with people around the world. I don’t ever publish clickbait or articles that have no basis in the truth just to get readers. But Facebook, in their algorithmic wisdom, will revoke my posting privileges multiple times per month every month because they do not approve of my content. The Bible teaching and the Christian-based news. Hmm…

Recently, Facebook deemed a post to be hate speech and banned it. The content? The Declaration of Independence. A few months ago it was revealed that Facebook is launching a algorithm that will block Christian and Conservative postings, just in time for the 2018 Midterm elections.

But articles that continue to spread provable lies about the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million Jews? That’s what Mark Zuckerberg says needs to be protected by our First Amendment. Want an example of what Zuckerberg says should be protected? How about a video from hate-filled antisemite Steven Anderson purporting that Jewish Holocaust survivors are ‘paid liars’?

What kind of Jew are you, Mark Zuckerberg? I would love to ask you that, but I think I already know the answer.

FROM NY DAILY NEWS: CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a 90-minute interview published on Recode Wednesday afternoon defended his company’s decision to allow such groups to remain on Facebook, saying he does not believe his company should be responsible for removing questionable content because it can not determine whether a post’s intention is to mislead.

“Let’s take this closer to home. I’m Jewish, and there’s a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened,” the 34-year-old billionaire said. “I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don’t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think they’re intentionally getting it wrong.” His interviewer, Recode’s editor-at-large Kara Swisher, at that point interjected to let him know misleading an audience may be the exact aim of Holocaust deniers. The Anti-Defamation League also later echoed the sentiment: ““Holocaust denial is a willful, deliberate and longstanding deception tactic by anti-Semites … Facebook has a moral and ethical obligation not to allow its dissemination.” But Zuckerberg continued: “I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly. I’m sure you do. I’m sure a lot of leaders and public figures we respect do too, and I just don’t think that it is the right thing to say, ‘We’re going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times.’” READ MORE Now The End Begins is your front line defense against the rising tide of darkness in the last days before the rapture of the church HOW TO DONATE: Click here to view our GoFundMe page When you contribute to this fundraising effort, you are helping us to do what the Lord called us to do.

856,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Donald Trump as the actor responsible for the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.,True,The article discusses the action of nominating Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not discuss any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Just when we might have thought we’d seen Donald Trump at his zaniest (say, in the first presidential debate) and most dangerous (say, in his executive order on immigration last week), he outdid himself with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch, 49, a judge from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (headquartered in Denver), to fill the late Antonin Scalia’s empty chair on the Supreme Court.

The zany part is the way our narcissist in chief introduced Gorsuch as his pick. The dangerous part is that Gorsuch is exactly the sort of Scalia-in-waiting we would expect from an extremist right-wing administration that aims to roll back constitutional rights in pursuit of a political agenda driven by the fantasies of racial nostalgia, misogyny and the passions of white nationalism.

Let’s deal with the zany part first:

Instead of the usual news release followed by a public meet-and-greet in the Rose Garden to introduce his first high court selection, Trump went the route of “Celebrity Apprentice” (perhaps Miss Universe might be a better analogy), fanning rumors that he had summoned both Gorsuch and another Supreme Court contender, 3rd Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman, to the White House in anticipation of the prime-time TV broadcast he had called to announce his choice—all for the purpose of building suspense and maximizing media interest. Fortunately for Hardiman, he was not on hand for the actual announcement, which Trump delivered in the East Room of the White House from what looked like the same lectern where President Obama stood to tell the world that Osama bin Laden had been killed.

Once again, Trump put himself center stage. With Gorsuch and his wife, Louise, on hand, in addition to Scalia’s widow, Maureen; Trump’s sons Eric and Don Jr.; chief strategist Steve Bannon; House Speaker Paul Ryan; and several GOP senators in a hall of white faces, Trump reminded viewers across the nation and the globe that he had long promised to select a jurist “in the mold of Justice Scalia,” as well as someone who “loves our Constitution.” Touting his selection process as “the most transparent in history,” he added that Gorsuch could serve on the high court for “50 years” and that his decisions could have an impact on American life for “a century or more.”

Sadly, and here’s the dangerous part: In Gorsuch, Trump has probably found his man. During the presidential election campaign, Trump listed 21 federal and state court judges as possible replacements for Scalia. In a comprehensive study led by Mercer University law professor Jeremy Kidd, Gorsuch was ranked second among the 21 in judicial qualities most resembling Scalia’s. Utah Supreme Court Justice Thomas Lee—the brother of Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah—garnered the top spot.

Professor Kidd and his fellow researchers based their rankings of Trump’s potential nominees according to their adherence to Scalia’s legal philosophy of “originalism” (the idea that judges should interpret the Constitution according to its presumed original meaning) and their propensity to issue dissenting opinions, in the fashion of Scalia, when their benchmates were unwilling to go as far doctrinally as the potential nominees would have liked.

Gorsuch was appointed to the 10th Circuit by President George W. Bush in 2006. Since then, he has amassed a conservative judicial record that confirms Kidd’s findings. His body of work has been summarized by both the liberal Alliance for Justice Action Campaign and the authoritative SCOTUSblog website. Their summaries encompass opinions, rulings, judicial votes and published articles on an array of vital constitutional issues, including:

In 2013, Gorsuch joined with five other members of a divided 10th Circuit panel to write a concurring opinion of his own in the case of Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius. The decision, subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote, held that for-profit corporations are persons under the law and can legally exercise their own religious views, even if doing so contravenes the rights of their female employees under the Affordable Care Act to receive health insurance coverage for contraceptive care.

In a decision issued in October, Gorsuch wrote a dissent in which he argued that the Circuit Court should reconsider whether Utah’s governor had acted improperly when he attempted to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood.

—The Second Amendment and the death penalty

In 2012, Gorsuch urged the 10th Circuit to re-examine and loosen its previous rulings on the right of felons to own firearms. The full court voted otherwise. Gorsuch has also been a consistent supporter of the death penalty.

—Access to the courts and attacks on liberals

As noted by the Alliance for Justice in a National Review Online op-ed published in 2005 before Gorsuch became a judge, he “attacked ‘American liberals’ for what he said was an over-reliance on constitutional litigation. He asserted that liberals’ ‘overweening addiction to the courtroom’ negatively affects public policy by aggrandizing the courts and consequently dampening ‘social experimentation’ by the legislative branches.” He has not been similarly critical of litigation initiated by right-wing organizations.

In accepting Trump’s nomination Tuesday night, Gorsuch praised Scalia as “a lion of the law.” In the weeks and months ahead, the Senate will debate and ultimately determine whether Gorsuch will have the opportunity to further Scalia’s legacy.

Will the Democrats find the courage to oppose him? Will progressives come together as a movement to demand that they do so, as they did to derail Ronald Reagan’s nomination of Scalia’s mentor, Robert Bork, in 1987?

With the Supreme Court’s remaining elderly justices (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, Anthony Kennedy, 80, and Stephen Breyer, 78) nearing the inevitable end of their professional careers, the future of our most powerful judicial body—and with it, the future of the Constitution—literally hangs in the balance."

If the Supreme Court of India has anything to say about it, he will face the ramifications of poisoning millions of Indian children with vaccines.

A recent report published by Health Impact News shows that a vaccine empire built on lies can only go on for so long. The reports states:

“While fraud and corruption are revealed on almost a daily basis now in the vaccine industry, the U.S. mainstream media continues to largely ignore such stories. Outside the U.S., however, the vaccine empires are beginning to crumble, and English versions of the news in mainstream media outlets are available via the Internet.

One such country is India, where the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and their vaccine empire are under fire, including a pending lawsuit currently being investigated by the India Supreme Court.”

If you aren’t aware of the key players in the vaccine mayhem being driven into African countries, they are:
• PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, funded by the Gates’ foundation), and
• GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, also funded by the Gates’ foundation)

All four of these organizations will now be expected to explain themselves due to a writ of petition originally submitted to the Supreme Court of India in 2012, by Kalpana Mehta, Nalini Bhanot, and Dr. Rukmini Rao, which has finally been heard by the courts.

“BMGF, PATH and WHO were criminally negligent trialling the vaccines on a vulnerable, uneducated and under-informed population school administrators, students and their parents who were not provided informed consent or advised of potential adverse effects or required to be monitored post-vaccination.”

Furthermore, though absent from most mainstream U.S. media outlets, the Economic Times of India published their report in August 2014, stating that young tribal girls were tested with HPV vaccines. This involved not a handful of children, but 16,000 individuals in Andhra Pradesh, India, where they were given the Gardasil vaccine.

KP Narayana Kumar reported that within a month of receiving the vaccine, many of the children fell ill, and by 2010, five of them had died. Another two children were reported to have died in Vadodara, Gujarat, where another 14,000 tribal children were vaccinated with another brand of the HPV vaccine, Cervarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmitheKline (GSK), who incidentally, has been accused of dumping polio virus into a Belgium river.

Consent forms to administer the HPV vaccine were ‘illegally’ signed by wardens form youth hostels, showing that the Gates’ prey on the indigent without parents. For those who had parents, most were illiterate, and the true potential dangers of the vaccines were not explained to them.

SAMA, an organization in India which promotes women’s health discovered this insidiousness, and reported it, but only now will Gates and his cronies have to answer for their misdeeds. Approximately 120 girls reported epileptic seizures, severe stomach cramps, headaches, and mood swings, of those who did not die. Other girls receiving the Gardasil vaccine have experienced infertility.

“The SAMA report also said there had been cases of early onset of menstruation following the vaccination, heavy bleeding and severe menstrual cramps among many students. The standing committee pulled up the relevant state governments for the shoddy investigation into these deaths.

It said it was disturbed to find that ‘all the seven deaths were summarily dismissed as unrelated to vaccinations without in-depth investigations …’ the speculative causes were suicides, accidental drowning in well (why not suicide?), malaria, viral infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage (without autopsy) etc.”

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation declared their little vaccine project a total success. I guess the Supreme Court of India will decide that now."

Following Youtube's recent ""purge"" on specific alternative youtube channels, British author David Icke has been removed from the video platform's search results for children according to reports.

According to James Cook, the Technology Editor for Business Insider UK, Youtube hasn't just banned David Icke form showing up on the Youtube search results on the kid's platform, but they have also vowed to remove content on their platform if Wikipedia label it as a “conspiracy theory”.

Business Insider reports: Search for ""UFO"" on YouTube Kids and you'll mostly find videos of toys that are clearly fine for children to watch. But one of the top videos claimed to show a UFO shooting at a chemtrail, and we found several videos by prominent conspiracy theorist David Icke in the suggested videos. YouTube removed the videos from YouTube Kids after we contacted it about the issue.

One suggested video was an hours-long lecture by Icke in which he claims that aliens built the pyramids, that the planet is run by reptile-human hybrids, that Freemasons engage in human sacrifice, that the assassination of President Kennedy was planned by the US government, and that humans would evolve in 2012.

Two other conspiracy theory videos by Icke appeared in the related videos, meaning it was easy for children to quickly go from watching relatively innocent videos about toys to conspiracy content.

YouTube said in a statement to Business Insider that ""sometimes we miss the mark"" on content appearing on YouTube Kids and said it would ""continue to work to improve the YouTube Kids app experience.""

""The YouTube Kids app is home to a wide variety of content that includes enriching and entertaining videos for families. This content is screened using human trained systems. That being said, no system is perfect and sometimes we miss the mark. When we do, we take immediate action to block the videos or, as necessary, channels from appearing in the app. We will continue to work to improve the YouTube Kids app experience.""

The YouTube Kids app blocks searches for most unsuitable videos. Search ""9/11"" or ""porn"" and you find no results. But we found that buried in the app's suggested videos were conspiracy videos that children could stumble on.

If you searched for ""moon landing"" on YouTube Kids, three videos appeared that claim that the moon landing was hoaxed. All three videos have since been hidden by YouTube after we informed it of the issue."

“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” 1 Corinthians 15:3,4 (KJV)

EDITOR’S NOTE: The really sad part of this story is that Catholics are concerned their rosary beads might be “cursed” by ‘Illuminati Satanists’. I’ve got news for you, all rosary beads, from whatever the source, are already cursed because of the pagan nature of the beads. Rosary beads do not come from the Bible, rather their origin is found in Buddhism and pagan Rome. The best thing a Catholic can do is chuck those nasty beads into the trash where they belong, repent of being a pagan, and get saved according to 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)

Father Ambrosio Nonato Legaspi made the claim on Novaliches’ Radio Veritas show Hello Father 911. A report on the show was carried on the news site of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines.

He said: “Listeners, be careful as the rosaries you might be using could actually be infested or cursed!”

The priest claimed that the rosaries were being given away by satanists, acting as part of a shadowy group called the Illuminati.

He said that the satanists had “prayed over” the rosaries to consecrate them to evil. Whoever then used them, he warned, would be “followed by evil spirits” as a result.

“These were made not only to be simply given away but to deceive Catholics… so that evil spirits will haunt them,” he added.

Speaking on the same show, Philippe De Guzman of the Diocese of Novaliches Office of Exorcism said the rosaries contained hidden symbols. These include such things as sunbursts, pentagrams and snakes, he claimed.

As proof of this, Mr De Guzman said they had confiscated such a rosary from a recent “infestation” case handled by exorcists. It was this artefact, he said, that was causing “disturbances” in the house.

“Sometimes, there are no symbols,” Father Legaspi said. “But a ritual was done on it so they could inflict harm on others.”

He then urged priests to bless and exorcise religious items, particularly if the owners had experienced paranormal occurrences.

Ackerman explains, “It ended up Lehman Brothers went under, and they needed a couple of sacrificial lambs, along with Bear Stearns. It could have just as easily been, and it might be the next time, Goldman Sachs. So, in that way, the Fed is kind of out of bailout bullets. We’ve already been through a bailout where it took a big hunk of the financial system. Each one takes more bailing out to get to that critical threshold of credibility where the bailout itself works.”

Ackerman sees bailout needs everywhere and gives the example of underwater state pensions across the country. Ackerman points out, “If you take just one piece of what they are going to have to bail out, which is going to start with the State of Illinois, which is probably going to be the first state that is going to collapse. It will renege on its pension obligations. So, if you picture the federal government riding to the rescue, the minute they bail out the Illinois pension system, California is there, along with New Jersey, Kentucky and a lot of other states, maybe 19 or 20 of them that have pension systems almost as insolvent as Illinois. . . . This means they are going to have to mail out checks to Illinois and then expand it to California, and all the other states that go under is to court hyperinflation. Of course, hyperinflation, in that sense, you can see where it has to collapse into deflation because . . . printing so much money that it is not going to buy the pensioner anything close to what it would have bought before the bailout. . . . So, a bailout is really self-defeating. . . . We can never inflate our way out of this abyss. . . .So, there is no bailout coming. . . . The debts will always be paid by either the borrower or the lender.”

Some people see a “Mad Max” scenario might be coming because of the enormous unpayable global debt. Ackerman contends, “I am a little more bearish than that. I see a Mad Max scenario as inevitable. . . . I try not to think about it because we’ve all got lives to live and kids to raise. . . . When you go back to the calculous of deflation and that every penny of every debt must be paid, if not by the borrower then by the lender, we have already put ourselves into a condition where Social Security is going to fail. Medicare is going to fail. All the ‘just-in-time’ deliveries are going to be in jeopardy. Food from the grocery stores, one day shipping from Amazon, I don’t see how all these thing s can continue to operate in a condition other than in the false prosperity that we have now. We are at the pinnacle of affluence.”

It’s becoming increasingly clear that the flu vaccine is little more than a money-making scheme. After all, we can’t really say that it’s effective enough to warrant widespread administration – quite the opposite, in fact. In the third part of a series exploring the spectacular failures of a variety of vaccines, Children’s Health Defense recently looked at the flu jab’s many shortcomings. Here are a few that stand out.

The flu vaccine has been 40 to 90 percent ineffective over the last 15 years

Nothing sums up all that is wrong with the flu shot quite as well as this sad statistic. People might be willing to overlook other issues with a shot if it affords them foolproof protection from a serious illness, but that simply isn’t the case here. Last year, the flu vaccine effectiveness across all age groups and flu viruses was just 29 percent. Moreover, when considering only the influenza A virus that took hold in late winter, it was ineffective 91 percent of the time.

The flu vaccine’s effectiveness goes down upon repeated vaccination

According to a study published by Canadian researchers this year, repeated flu vaccination makes the current year’s vaccine effectiveness weaker. They looked at people aged 65 years or older to explore the impact of previous vaccination for 10 prior flu seasons.

For those who got the vaccine in 2015-16 but hadn’t gotten one in the decade before it, their vaccine effectiveness was 34 percent, which is already pretty ineffective. However, the picture is even bleaker for those who did have previous vaccines, with those getting 1-3, 4-6, 7-8, or 9-10 vaccines in the previous decade noting current-year effectiveness of 26%, 24%, 13%, and 7% respectively. A different study carried out by Spanish researchers showed vaccine effectiveness of 20 percent of lower among those who had just one previous vaccination.

People who get flu vaccines become more susceptible to non-vaccine flu viruses and other infections

Children who were given a seasonal flu vaccine were found in a study to be more susceptible to acute non-influenza respiratory viruses in the following nine months. Other studies have shown that people who got a 2008 seasonal flu shot had more than a two-fold greater risk of H1N1.

The effectiveness of the flu vaccine is very inconsistent

The effectiveness of the flu vaccine can experience dramatic seasonal fluctuations, and it depends largely on how accurately manufacturers are able to guess which virus strains they need to include in the vaccine for any given year. This year, for example, the vaccine is not a very good match for one of the most common strains circulating that is particularly hard on children.

Factors like imprinting, which is how a person’s first flu infection shapes their immune memory over their lifestyle, can play a role in future infection risk. Moreover, obese people have a lower response to the flu vaccine than those of a healthy weight given obesity’s ability to impact people’s metabolism and age their immune system cells.

Some researchers aren’t reporting on their efficacy findings honestly

Flu vaccine proponents often offer up misleading information to support their claims. For example, some researchers have been known to wait two weeks after vaccination to start collecting illness information, which means short-term adverse events may not be accounted for. They might also use wording that masks discouraging findings.

Although a 50 percent increase in the worldwide flu vaccine market has been predicted by 2023, American adults appear to be growing more skeptical of the shot, with flu vaccine coverage dropping for every age group among adults and dipping to an eight-year low. Some researchers say that they hesitate to discuss flu vaccine problems because they don’t want to be labeled as being “anti-vaccination,” so it is up to the public to take a closer look at the facts and make their own decisions."
862,True,The article suggests that there is a conspiracy involving the US government and its allies to overthrow the Syrian government and support radical groups in Syria.,True,"The article mentions President Obama, Assad, the US, its allies, the Syrian military, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and National Security Advisor John Bolton as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,"The article mentions actions such as the US spending billions to get rid of Assad, providing weapons and training to radicals, warnings issued by the US and its allies, and the Syrian military preparing to liberate Idlib.",True,The article mentions threats to the three million Syrians in Idlib and the possibility of a false flag attack with US air support.,True,"The article connects events and observations to suggest a larger conspiracy involving the US government, radical groups, and the Syrian government.",True,The article suggests that there is secrecy and misinformation surrounding the actions and intentions of the US government and its allies.,"Assad was supposed to be gone already. President Obama thought it would be just another “regime change” operation and perhaps Assad would end up like Saddam Hussein or Yanukovych. Or maybe even Gaddafi. But he was supposed to be gone. The US spent billions to get rid of him and even provided weapons and training to the kinds of radicals that attacked the United States on 9/11.

But with the help of his allies, Assad has nearly defeated this foreign-sponsored insurgency.

The US fought him every step of the way. Each time the Syrian military approached another occupied city or province, Washington and its obedient allies issued the usual warnings that Assad was not liberating territory but was actually seeking to kill more of his own people.

Remember Aleppo, where the US claimed Assad was planning mass slaughter once he regained control? As usual the neocons and the media were completely wrong. Even the UN has admitted that with Aleppo back in the hands of the Syrian government hundreds of thousands of Syrians have actually moved back. We are supposed to believe they willingly returned so that Assad could kill them?

The truth is Aleppo is being rebuilt. Christians celebrated Easter there this spring for the first time in years. There has been no slaughter once al-Qaeda and ISIS’ hold was broken. Believe me, if there was a slaughter we would have heard about it in the media!

So now, with the Syrian military and its allies prepare to liberate the final Syrian province of Idlib, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again warns the Syrian government against re-taking its own territory. He Tweeted on Friday that: “The three million Syrians, who have already been forced out of their homes and are now in Idlib, will suffer from this aggression. Not good. The world is watching.”

President Trump’s National Security Advisor, John Bolton, has also warned the Syrian government that the US will attack if it uses gas in Idlib. Of course, that warning serves as an open invitation to rebels currently holding Idlib to set off another false flag and enjoy US air support.

Bolton and Pompeo are painting Idlib as a peaceful province resisting the violence of an Assad who they claim just enjoys killing his own people. But who controls Idlib province? President Trump’s own Special Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, Brett McGurk, said in Washington just last year that, “Idlib province is the largest al-Qaeda safe-haven since 9/11, tied to directly to Ayman al Zawahiri, this is a huge problem.”

Could someone please remind Pompeo and Bolton that al-Qaeda are the bad guys?

After six years of a foreign-backed regime-change operation in Syria, where hundreds of thousands have been killed and the country nearly fell into the hands of ISIS and al-Qaeda, the Syrian government is on the verge of victory. Assad is hardly a saint, but does anyone really think al-Qaeda and ISIS are preferable? After all, how many Syrians fled the country when Assad was in charge versus when the US-backed “rebels” started taking over?

Americans should be outraged that Pompeo and Bolton are defending al-Qaeda in Idlib. It’s time for the neocons to admit they lost. It is time to give Syria back to the Syrians. It is time to pull the US troops from Syria. It is time to just leave Syria alone!

Senator Ron Johnson stated this week there was a “secret society” within the FBI and DOJ that has off site meetings “to map out survival strategy at the FBI.” Other Congressmen, who have seen an unreleased memo naming names of high ranking members of the FBO and DOJ, say jail time is coming for many because of corruption and crime. The crimes they are referring to involve exonerating Hillary Clinton in the face of obvious law breaking and attacking the Trump Administration with a phony dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton.

The U.S. dollar has been tanking this week and hit new 3-year lows in 2018. It’s now below 90 on the US Dollar Index. At the beginning of 2017, it was at 103. Can inflation be far behind?

Russia has a nuclear arsenal as large as Washington’s, and Russia is very much aware that for 13 years Washington’s lies and demonizations of countries are the preludes to launching military attacks on the countries.

It is completely obvious that no one in Washington has enough sense to be in government. In Washington power is in demonic and idiotic hands. Washington consists of the largest collection of criminal fools in human history.

865,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions the American Pravda media as the actor responsible for biased coverage against Trump.,True,The article discusses the actions of the American Pravda media in undermining and destroying the Trump presidency.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"The American Pravda media isn’t merely biased against Trump — it’s HYPER-biased, which is why most Americans can’t stand them

While you may personally not be a fan of President Donald J. Trump, an electoral majority of Americans voted for him — defying predictions, political logic, and the American Pravda media, most of whom still have not accepted the fact that he beat perhaps the most corrupt presidential nominee ever in Hillary Clinton. (Related: #StandAgainstCensorship by taking action: 10 powerful things you can do NOW to take back your freedom from the “techno tyrants”)

The media’s disbelief has since turned into a seething anger, with most inside-the-Beltway reporters, correspondents, talking heads, and commentators waking each morning only to find they are triggered by the fact that the president is still president (and still tweeting).

But it’s not because they haven’t ‘done their part’ in trying to make him an ex-president, even before he serves his first term in office. Since about 9 o’clock in the evening on Election Day, Nov. 8, 2016, when it became apparent that not even California’s majority could push Clinton’s derrière to victory the “mainstream” media has been conspiring to undermine and destroy the Trump presidency with no small amount of false allegations, unsubstantiated suppositions, and outright fake news.

In fact, according to a new study by the Media Research Center, fully 91 percent of coverage of Trump by the three broadcast networks — ABC, NBC, and CBS — during the first two months of this year was negative, Lifezette reported.

That is such a lopsided statistic that there is no way the networks can spin it: They don’t like our president and what’s more, they have no intention of covering him fairly.

Researchers analyzed the three networks’ evening newscasts throughout January and February. Of the 712 evaluative statements made by anchors, reporters or supposedly non-partisan sources about Trump and his administration, only nine percent were positive. A total of 647 statements were negative in tone and assessment.

“This study, along with those we published in 2017, shows that even after 14 months, the liberal media remain utterly unreconciled to Trump’s presidency,” Rich Noyes, MRC’s research director and author of the study, told LifeZette in an email. “In my 30+ years of studying the media, it is absolutely unprecedented for a president to receive such relentlessly negative coverage for such a long period of time.”

Is all of this Trump hate justified? Depends on who you voted for, I guess, but if you want to be fair, you’d have to conclude that, no, it’s not fair.

Since Trump was elected, the stock market has gone wild, setting scores of records — nearly daily for months — for new “highs.” “The markets have been roaring,” Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management, told The Wall Street Journal in January. With each new stock market record, the retirement accounts of tens of millions of ordinary Americans grow.

Meanwhile, wages for American workers have been rising as well in the Trump era, thanks to the president’s pro-growth policies. “President Donald Trump’s first full year in office saw gains that easily outdistanced any year for his predecessor, Barack Obama, whose best showing was the 2.2 percent increases in 2016 and 2014. Six of Obama’s eight years in office saw gains of 2 percent or less,” CNBC reported in January. In fact, in many industries growth is coming so fast there aren’t enough workers to keep pace.

“Though the media has been loathe to report this fact, 2017 has been a banner year for the U.S. economy,” Fox News Laura Ingraham said late last year on her evening program, “an incredible comeback from President Obama’s non-recovery recovery.”

But most Americans don’t know these things because the Pravda media won’t report them. They’re too consumed with their #TrumpHate to be honest purveyors of news and information, as the MRC study proves.

That helps explain why trust in the media continues to fall; they continue to attack a president the majority of the country outside California voted for.

Come to think of, maybe Bill Gates really is building the Mark of the Beast, he certainly has assembled an impressive supporting cast, like satanist Madonna.

Isn’t it ironic that Bill Gates, the man whose father ran Planned Parenthood and was taught from childhood about population control through abortion, now desperately wants you to believe he is interested in saving human life? Don’t make me laugh. But what he does want to do is to control the healthcare of every person on the planet, that’s for sure. No better way to control the masses than to control their health. Now comes the announcement that Bill Gates is teaming up with end times satanist, Madonna, pushing something called the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator.

Rubino explains, “The coming monetary reset and what that means for gold and what that means for the rest of the global financial system, you don’t need a war to bring that about because we are making enough financial mistakes that will get us there in no time flat now without geopolitical turmoil. If you add a big war in the Middle East into the equation, then anything can happen. A scenario right now that is very, very feasible is we start shooting in the Middle East and Russia and China is on the other side of this in one way or another. They help Iran, and we have our allies helping us, and we start using these next generation weapons that are breathtakingly powerful. Nobody has any idea what’s going to happen when we start throwing these things at each other. . . . Oil spikes to $100 – $150 per barrel, and that tips the already extremely fragile global financial system over the edge. So, we get the ‘Greater Depression’ or the monetary reset or a hyperinflation or whatever we get sooner rather than later. It’s a disaster for everybody when it happens that way.”

Rubino says the monetary masters “tried to fix the financial system but could not do it.” Rubino says, “If you think you are beyond the point of no return financially as an individual, you borrow as much money as you can, and then go bankrupt. . . . Governments in the world are starting to do that now or behaving that way. . . . There is nothing they can do to fix the system. In the U.S., they tried to fix the system and scale back and they found out that is impossible. The central bank in the U.S. cannot raise interest rates without the economy collapsing. . . . So, they basically gave up. . . . They are printing a lot of currency electronically and dumping it into the banking system. . . . The consequence for the currency is to make it less valuable year after year . . . then you get the crackup boom . . . where people just lose faith in the currency because they see the government is going to make it less valuable year after year. So, there is no point in holding that currency as savings. They spend it as fast as they get it.”

In closing, Rubino says, “We have entered a new stage which feels like one of the end stages of this process—when governments just give up and don’t even pretend to try and control their finances anymore. Well, we are there. That’s when it will be clear to everybody that is the case, and then your gold goes through the roof. The investment thesis ends with you loading up on precious metals and then riding the inflation and/or monetary reset that has to happen because of past mistakes. . . . The nightmare scenario is if we are already having a financial crisis and then we have a war with China and Russia, it’s unimaginable. I cannot factor that into a scenario for financial asset prices because it is too crazy.”

France has confirmed it is prepared to launch 'targeted' strikes against 'chemical weapon' sites in Syria, which could result in the deaths of many civilians in the country.

French President Emmanuel Macron said in a news conference, whilst on his official visit to India on Monday, that France's military is ready to strike if it was to find ""irrefutable evidence"" of chemical weapons the being used on civilians in Syria.



""The day we have, in particular in tandem with our American partners, irrefutable proof that the red line was crossed -- namely the chemical weapons were used to lethal effect -- we will do what the Americans themselves did moreover a few months ago; we would put ourselves in position to proceed with targeted strikes,"" Macron said.

PressTV reports: ""We are cross-matching our own information with that of our allies but to put it very clearly we have an independent capacity to identify targets and launch strikes where needed,"" the French president added.

Earlier on Monday, Russian media said that the Syrian military had found a workshop used by foreign-backed militants to make chemical weapons.

The workshop was discovered in a recently-liberated area in Eastern Ghouta where Syrian troops are fighting foreign-backed extremists and Takfiri terrorists.

The workshop was discovered in a recently-liberated area in Eastern Ghouta where Syrian troops are fighting foreign-backed extremists and Takfiri terrorists, Russian news agencies reported Monday, citing a field commander.

This comes as Western governments and their allies have never stopped pointing the finger at Damascus whenever an apparent chemical attack takes place.

Syria surrendered its stockpiles of chemical weapons in 2014 to a joint mission led by the US and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which oversaw the destruction of the weaponry. Damascus has also consistently denied using chemical weapons over the course of the foreign-backed militancy that has gripped the country since 2011.

Meanwhile, the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is sympathetic to the militants operating against the Damascus government, said recently that a suspected chlorine attack had taken place in Eastern Ghouta region on February 25.

Prior to the report, Moscow, which has been backing Damascus in its terror fight, had warned that militant groups in Eastern Ghouta were preparing a false flag attack in a bid to blame the Syrian government for using chemical weapons against civilians.

Russia warns that militants in Eastern Ghouta are preparing to launch a chemical attack which they plan to blame on the Syrian government.

In January, pro-militant sources in Syria, the White Helmets and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, claimed that the Syrian government had used chlorine gas against militants in northwestern Syria.

The US and UK raised the issue at the UN Security Council on February 6, but the Syrian envoy rejected the allegations as “false and cheap.”

Last year, a suspected sarin gas attack hit the town of Khan Shaykhun in the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib, taking at least 80 lives. Accusing Damascus, the US then launched several dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase, which the opponents of the Syrian government claimed was used as the launch pad for the alleged gas attack, taking the lives of about 20 people, including both Syrian soldiers and civilians.

Damascus denied the accusation of being behind the alleged gas attack and described it as a “fabrication” to justify the subsequent US missile strike.

Damascus says the Israeli regime and its Western and regional allies are aiding Takfiri terrorist groups that are wreaking havoc in the Arab country.

The Syrian government and allied fighters have managed to liberate most of the territories that used to be under the control of the militants for the past years."
869,True,"The article discusses Twitter's decision to censor content related to Covid-19 that does not comply with the guidance of 'public health experts'.

The company says the warnings will extend to anything deemed to be out of step with the advice of health authorities. The move is to provide users with “additional context,” according to Public Policy Director Nick Pickles.

The warning messages will conceal the tweet from view (censor it) unless the user clicks through to it.

“These warnings will inform people that the information in the Tweet conflicts with public health experts’ guidance before they view it,” the company said in a blog post.

Tweets targeted by the warnings will include merely casting doubt on the need to practice social distancing or wear a mask, according to reports.

The company says it has a tiered system in place to determine how ‘severe’ the ‘conspiracy theory’ is.

Twitter told PC mag that “For example, a tweet that says ‘wearing a mask will get you sick’ could easily be adopted, and put people at risk. A tweet that says ‘COVID came from a lab in China,’ on the other hand, poses no immediate risk to causing harm.”

Coronavirus misinformation found to be “moderately” harmful, will carry a label under the content that says “Get the facts about COVID-19”, and will provide a link to a “Twitter-curated page or external trusted source.”

In order to identify offending tweets, Twitter says it will “rely on trusted partners to identify content that is likely to result in offline harm.”

Twitter is once again following in lockstep with Google, and Facebook, in removing content they deem to be untrustworthy.

Several videos have been banned by YouTube and Facebook in recent days and weeks, including doctors speaking out against the lockdown and measures used to combat the virus.

Back in 1941, there was this foreign nation, Japan, which was illegally occupying other peoples' lands in China and Indonesia.

There were Americans in close proximity to that foreign nation, in the then-territory of Hawaii, and even though the Americans had not actually done much of anything, that foreign nation decided it had the right to attack and kill Americans just on the off chance that somewhere down the road, they might be in inconvenience.

Thus came about the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Now, just for a moment imagine that instead of declaring immediate war on those who attacked Americans, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had rushed over to the League of Nations to explain why Japan's attack on Americans was really no big deal, and that Japan had good reason to attack and kill Americans! Imagine if Roosevelt, instead of the ""Day of Infamy"" speech, had made countless excuses why Japan was perfectly right to attack and kill Americans. Imagine that the US Congress, instead of voting war against the nation that attacked Americans decided to punish those who criticized the nation that attacked Americans?

Quite an amazing fantasy isn't it? Yet this is exactly what we have seen the present government do over the last years ever since Israel's attack on the aid flotilla!

Israel, citing grounds of national security, occupies the lands of Palestine, just as Japan, citing national security, occupied China. The Americans in the aid flotilla had not actually done anything to threaten Israel, just like the Americans sitting in Pearl Harbor had done nothing to threaten Japan.

1941 Japan attacks Americans in the middle of an ocean and the US goes to war against Japan.

2010 Israel attacks Americans in the middle of a sea and the US Government protects the attacker.

In 1904, American businessman Ion Perdicaris was taken prisoner by Mulai Raisuli. Now, from Raisuli's point of view, he had good reason to take Perdicaris prisoner as Raisuli was fighting against foreign occupation of his homeland. Even Perdicaris conceded that Raisuli was acting from what Perdicaris considered justifiable motives.

But President Roosevelt did not view the affair from Raisuli's point of view. He viewed it from the point of view of a President of the United States. Under the slogan ""Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead!"" Roosevelt sent 7 US Battleships with orders to destroy Morocco if Perdicaris was not released. Perdicaris was sent home.

Today is different. Today we have a President and a Congress that, even as the United States crumbles around them, are obsessively concerned with protecting Israel, no matter what it does.

Israel attacked foreign flagged ships in international waters (the very activity the 6th fleet is killing Somali coastal patrol crews for), hijacked a US-flagged ship, and kidnapped 12 Americans, shooting one of them in the head 4 times.

A real President, who remembers that his job is to take care of America and Americans, would not rush to the UN to protect the nation that just attacked Americans.

A real Congress, who remembers that their job is to take care of America and Americans, would not hand Israel a license to murder more Americans anywhere in the world Israel decides they are an inconvenience!

No government can serve two masters, and a government that serves Israel cannot serve the American people.

A friend to Israel is no friend of America.

America needs leaders who will put America first, second, and third.

UPDATE: The United Nations issued their final report on the flotilla attack, and while refusing to challenge the starvation blockade itself, did condemn Israel's attack on the aid fltoilla in international waters. Turkey has demanded an apology from Israel. Israel, true to form, is refusing any apology or admission of fault, and already Israel's enablers are screaming that the United Nations is a haven for Nazis and anti-Semites. Turkey has expelled the Israeli ambassador and severed all relations with Israel until there is an apology.

It's governments like Turley that remind you what total pussies cower inside the White House and the Congress!

The bill passed by Congress last year supporting Israel's attack on Americans in international waters is a signed confession. Every member of Congress who voted for the bill, spoke out in support of Israel, indeed even the President who ordered the US ambassador to the United Nations to intervene at the UN and try to block an investigation, is now an admitted accessory after the fact in Israel's attack on a US-flagged ship and American citizens in international waters. Because Congress voted to commit this crime, add a conspiracy charge as well. Where is America's apology, President Pussy? When does Israel compensate the American activists for their lost equipment and for the death of that 19-year old kid from New York, shot in the head as he lay in the deck, members of Congress?

UPDATE 2: Israel has finally agreed to apologize to Turkey in a deal brokered by the White House over the deaths from Israel's attacks on the aid flotilla. This apology is onloy to Turley and did not include an apology to the United States for the 19-year old American also killed in the attack. Apparently the US doesn't rate as high as Turkey in Israel's or the White House's esteem."

Trump has sometimes struggled on the GOP debate stage. On Tuesday night, he owned it.

EDITOR’S NOTE: From this point on, there is nothing in the way of Donald Trump to becoming the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Jeb Bush, however, has repeatedly declared that “Donald Trump will never be president”. If you follow conspiracy theory, perhaps that is something that Mr. Trump should be considering carefully. Stay far away from the grassy knoll, Donald, history has a funny way of repeating itself.

Donald Trump made few mistakes, despite efforts by the moderators and the other candidates to knock him out of the pole position. While Sens. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) 79% sparred over past Senate votes, and other candidates repeated lines familiar from the campaign trail, Trump looked comfortable–and solid.

He may not always have had the “right” answer, but he sounded more fluent with his own positions. At one stage, he even felt confident enough to tangle with members of the audience–supporters, it seemed, of Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) –who booed his idea to “infiltrate” Islamic State on the Internet.

“I just can’t imagine somebody booing. These are people that want to kill us, folks, and you’re objecting to us infiltrating their conversations? I don’t think so.”Perhaps Trump’s rally on Monday evening was a useful warmup. There, Trump sparred jovially with left-wing hecklers and mocked the media for covering them.

Perhaps, too, grim events have conspired to affirm Trump’s “bombastic” (Carly Fiorina’s word) approach to national security: as he pointed out, both the Paris and San Bernardino terror attacks have happened since the last GOP debate.

Perhaps Trump simply knows he is sitting on a big lead.

Regardless, Trump won on Tuesday night–at times by fighting hard, at times by letting the stragglers squabble.

There were few personal attacks, no misstatements of his own policies. He faced repeated (and repetitive) attacks from Jeb Bush–often instigated by the moderators, as Trump pointed out–and simply pointed to his poll numbers.

He took a pass on Hugh Hewitt’s question about the nuclear triad. His opponents will remember. No one else will.

The CNN moderators pressed Donald Trump early on his recent proposal to stop Muslims from immigrating or visiting the U.S. His answer was simple and stark: “We are not talking about isolation. We’re talking about security. We’re not talking about religion. We’re talking about security.”

No one–least of all Bush–laid a glove on him after that.

The vaunted Trump-vs.-Cruz fight failed to materialize. Cruz allowed himself to become entangled in arguments over foreign policy between the interventionist Rubio and the reticent Paul, who blasted Rubio on immigration.

Dr. Ben Carson and Fiorina had moments, and the other two governors onstage sounded clear themes–New Jersey’s Chris Christie attacking Washington, and Ohio’s John Kasich calling for less bickering.

But it was Trump’s night.

When Hewitt asked Trump to re-affirm his commitment to staying within the Republican Party, Trump said he would do so, prompting Hewitt himself to applaud.

“I feel honored to be the frontrunner,” Trump explained.

After winning the last debate of 2015, Trump is not just the frontrunner. He is the favorite to win the nomination. source"

Editors expressed consternation at the inevitable tarnishing of Switzerland’s image and worried about the consequences. Will there be boycotts? Sanctions? Appeals to the European Court of Human Rights? I can anticipate right now arguments to excuse this outbreak of bigotry in the Alps that will be advanced by our own fringe Right, of neoconservatives and those who think, without daring to say it, that “white culture” is superior to all other world civilizations and deserves to dominate or wipe the others out.

The first is that it is only natural that white, Christian Europeans should be afraid of being swamped by people adhering to an alien, non-European religion.

Switzerland is said to be 5 percent Muslim, and of course this proportion is a recent phenomenon there and so unsettling to some. But Islam is not new to Europe. Parts of what is now Spain were Muslim for 700 years, and much of the eastern stretches of what is now the European Union were ruled by Muslims for centuries and had significant Muslim populations. Cordoba and Sarajevo are not in Asia or Latin America. They are in Europe. And they are cities formed in the bosom of Muslim civilization.

The European city of Cordoba in the medieval period has been described thusly:

So if the Swiss think that Islam is alien to Europe, then they are thinking of a rather small Europe, not the Europe that now actually exists. Minarets dotted Cordoba. The Arnaudia mosque in Banja Luca dates back to the 1400s; it was destroyed along with dozens of others by fanatics in the civil war that accompanied the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

As for the likely comeback,that Muslims came to Europe from the 700s of the Common Era as conquerors, unlike Christianity, actually both were conquering state religions. It was the conversion of an emperor that gave a favored position to Christianity in Europe, which was a small minority on the continent at the time. And Charlemagne forcibly imposed Christianity on the German tribes up to the Elbe. In the cases both of European Christianity and European Islam, there were many willing converts among the ordinary folk, who thrilled to itinerant preachers or beautiful chanting.

Others will allege that Muslims do not grant freedom of religion to Christians in their midst. First of all, this allegation is not true if we look at the full range of the countries where the 1.5 billion Muslims live. Among the nearly 60 Muslim-majority states in the world, only one, Saudi Arabia, forbids the building of churches. Does Switzerland really want to be like Saudi Arabia?

Here is a Western Christian description of the situation of Christians in Syria:

That is, in Muslim-majority Syria, the government actually grants land to Christians for the building of churches, along with free water and electricity. Christians have their own personal status legal code, straight from the Vatican. (It is because Christians have their own law in the Middle East, backed by the state, that Muslims in the West are puzzled as to why they cannot practice their personal status code.) Christians have freedom of religion, though there are sensitivities about attempts to convert others (as there are everywhere in the Middle East, including Israel). And Christians are represented in the legislature. With Switzerland’s 5 percent Muslim population, how many Muslim members of parliament does it have?

It will also be alleged that in Egypt some clergymen gave fatwas or legal opinions that building churches is a sin, and it will be argued that Christians have been attacked by Muslims in Upper Egypt.

These arguments are fallacies. You cannot compare the behavior of some Muslim fanatics in rural Egypt to the laws and ideals of the Swiss Republic. We have to look at Egyptian law and policy.

The Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar Seminary, the foremost center of Sunni Muslim learning, “added in statements carried by Egyptian newspaper Youm al-Saba’a that Muslims can make voluntary contributions to build churches, pointing out that the church is a house for ‘worshipping and tolerance.'” He condemned the fundamentalist Muslims for saying church-building is sinful. And Egypt has lots of churches, including new Presbyterian ones, following John Calvin, who I believe lived in … Geneva. About six percent of the population is Christian.

The other problem with excusing Switzerland with reference to Muslims’ own imperfect adherence to human rights ideals is that two wrongs don’t make a right. The bigoted Right doesn’t even have the moral insight of kindergartners if that is the sort of argument they advance. The International Declaration of Human Rights was crafted with the participation of Pakistan, a Muslim country; the global contemporary rights regime is imperfectly adhered to by all countries — it is a claim on the world’s behavior, something we must all strive for. If the Swiss stepped back from it, they stepped back in absolute terms. It doesn’t help us get to global human rights to say that is o.k. because others are also failing to live up to the Declaration.

The other Wahhabi state besides Saudi Arabia, Qatar, has allowed the building of Christian churches. But they are not allowed to have steeples or bells. This policy is a mirror image to that of the Swiss. So Switzerland, after centuries of striving for civilization and enlightenment, has just about reached the same level of tolerance as that exhibited by a small Gulf Wahhabi country, the people of which were mostly Bedouins only a hundred years ago."

Americans are so used to being lied to by government, the media, and corporations that they have little trust for anyone anymore. So when we’re told, for example, that the government would never, ever experiment with weather patterns using potentially dangerous chemicals, some sheep will continue to believe such tripe, but an increasing number of us just don’t.

And for good reason, too: the “official” line from Uncle Sam and other governments that there is no such thing as “chemtrails” is a complete lie, and recent testimony by an expert in the know before the United Nations proves the point, as reported by the Waking Times.

A video of Rosalind Peterson (below), president of the Agriculture Defense Coalition, features her speaking at the UN to discuss geoengineering, chemtrails, and weather modification. She notes that people have been told that they were simply being doused with water vapor, yet hundreds of thousands have suffered from a range of health issues including neurological problems and reproductive issues, as well as hormonal imbalances and much more.

As the Waking Times notes further:

In her 2007 UN testimony, she said that the issue of climate change and global warming was a major concern for agriculture, obviously, but also that at least a portion of climate change has been manmade, but not in the industrial sense – in the sense that weather-changing chemicals were intentionally being added to the environment.

“Weather modification programs, experimental ones done by private companies, by the United States government, done by states, across the United States – there’s more than 50 of them in operation across the United States,” she testified. “All of these impact agriculture because they change the micro-climates needed for agriculture to survive.

“None of these programs that I know of today – and this is all public record – are available at anytime with oversight… agricultural oversight or public oversight,” she continued. “These programs impact agriculture, and there are programs around the world, international corporations [which] are modifying our weather all the time, and they’re modifying it in ways that cover thousands and thousands of square miles.”

Peterson went on to say that skies people see every day are “not normal cloud cover – these are manmade.”

Not so ironically, chemtrail and weather modification programs really aren’t all that covert. While governments don’t discuss them openly, companies involved in such experimentation aren’t exactly hiding, either. There is even a company called Weather Modification, Inc., which boasts, “When most people look up they see clouds. We see potential.”

“Now, more than ever, the worldwide need for solutions to atmospheric necessities such as water resource management and environmental quality monitoring, is critical. With nearly a half-century of successful programs, our experience speaks for itself,” the company says on its web site. “Cloud seeding” is just one of the services it offers. In fact, according to Geoengineering Watch, there are several the group has identified and listed.

As far back as 1996, in a paper presented to the U.S. Air Force, several officers proposed “owning the weather” by 2025 as a massive force multiplier:

cIn 2025, US aerospace forces can “own the weather” by capitalizing on emerging technologies and focusing development of those tehnologies to war-fighting applications. Such a capability offers the war fighter tools to shape the battlespace in ways never before possible,” the authors said in their Executive Summary. “It provides opportunities to impact operations across the full spectrum of conflict and is pertinent to all possible futures. The purpose of this paper is to outline a strategy for the use of a future weather-modification system to achieve military objectives rather than to provide a detailed technical road map.

As noted further by Waking Times:

Chemtrails are likely causing Parkinsons’ disease, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, headaches, respiratory ailments, reproductive failure, liver failure, and a host of other diseases. Since we have an openly admitted agenda by the UN to limit the growth of our population, what else are they doing besides affecting climate change with chemtrails?"

This is primarily a dispute between China and Japan. Both countries say the islands belong to them. They are believed to be rich in oil and gas deposits. Vice President Biden was sent to both countries to calm tensions. The U.S. says it has sided with Japan, but it seems to have backed off demanding the Chinese drop this air defense zone that stretches for 600 miles. The dispute is far from over. People like multi-billion dollar fund manager Kyle Bass think this could lead to war. China and Japan both have severe financial problems. China and Japan are the number one and number two holders of U.S. Treasury debt. If either country gets mad and decides to sell their debt, it could cause a financial calamity here in the U.S. Sounds like a lose-lose to me if things turn violent.

The Syrian civil war rages on, and now there are new charges of atrocities the U.N. says have been committed by the Assad regime. Assad denies the charges, but news is breaking ahead of a peace conference that is scheduled in early 2014 in Geneva. I do not see how these new charges are going to allow Basher al Assad to cut a deal that keeps him in power. That conflict is also far from over.

In the latest Obama Care news, apparently, you cannot keep your doctor either! USA Today reported this past week that “Doctors are getting Dropped” from insurance plans. There are also glaring security issues according to computer experts. Some are warning for people not to log onto Healthcare.gov until the site is truly fixed. Meanwhile, the President is out this week telling young people to “be responsible” and sign up for health insurance. The President has taken a big hit in the polls, especially when it comes to young people. Obama desperately needs young healthy people to sign up for Obama Care. It is a key component of it working, and most young people are simply going to pay the fine. Why wouldn’t they? Pre-existing conditions are no longer a problem. You can just sign up when you need medical treatment.

Finally, Detroit has been cleared for Federal Bankruptcy. This means union workers can have big cuts given to their pensions. Some of these folks have written comments on the USAWatchdog site and said they opted out of Social security and only have their pension. This is the problem when you get everything you ask for and nothing you were promised. This was a known problem for years. The bankruptcy judge said, “Detroit could have and should have filed for bankruptcy long before it did.” This is what it looks like when you can no longer borrow money to pay your bills. Professor Laurence Kotlikoff said this week, “America in Worse Fiscal Shape than Detroit.” That is one scary thought.

I’ve spent two decades reading about the horrors of Vietnam, and truly believe it was this fool’s errand, initiated by sociopaths with little regard for the value of human life, that truly marked the beginning of the end of the American empire. By the time the last Marines ignominiously left ten years later, 58,000 American troops were dead, 300,000 were wounded, and the war was lost. Meanwhile, Communism never took over the world as advertised by the propagandists; and care of massive war spending requirements, the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1971, sentencing countless billions – present and future – to death by inflation. And worst of all, when our soldiers returned after a decade of horrifying war – many of them disabled and traumatized – they were treated as criminals and outcasts by an ungrateful government, and society at large. And thus, let’s all take a minute to salute not only our Vietnam veterans, but the countless hundreds of millions that sacrificed their lives for causes real and fabricated, throughout the course of history.

That said, let’s get back to the incurable financial trauma caused by said gold standard abandonment. Which, by the way, should decidedly NOT be blamed solely on the Nixon Administration. And no, I’m not just referring to Lyndon Johnson’s budget-busting “guns and butter” spending, but the fact that all Bretton Woods signees sat back and allowed the U.S. to renege on its obligations – based on the same selfish political reasons. In other words, it was a group effort to inflict future generations with inflationary cancer; and thus, all the world’s “leading” Central bankers are to blame.

As for said “cancer,” it has clearly metastasized throughout the entire world; not coincidentally, entering its terminal stage shortly after the global financial system permanently broke in 2008. More specifically, it was the mid-2011 “global meltdown II” – when European sovereign bonds collapsed, and the U.S. was stripped of its triple-A rating – that catalyzed the real money printing explosion – yielding a torrent of Western inflation exportation that has caused the average global currency to plunge by 40% since. Or in the case of the “fragile five” nations, where a quarter of the world’s population resides, their average currency collapse has been closer to 50% – and counting. Not only that, the monetary tsunami – which frankly, started at the turn of the century, when the global economy peaked – was accompanied by the invention of financial “weapons of mass destruction” – like derivatives – that have caused just as much damage as the military, if not more. And no, it’s no coincidence that the Glass Steagall Act was repealed in 1999, coinciding with the financial sector commandeering Congress with lobbying rivaled only by the defense and healthcare sectors.

878,False,The article does not discuss any conspiracy theories.,True,The article mentions central banks and fiat currencies as actors responsible for the erosion of faith in the market.,True,The article discusses the actions of central banks in manipulating interest rates and printing money.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not connect events or observations to an integrated whole.,False,The article does not convey any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"Money manager Michael Pento says, “We live in a world now where free markets have been completely obliterated. You can’t find a free market left on the planet, and that goes for commodities, equity markets, currencies and particularly goes for the bond markets. The bond markets now do not represent any vestige of reality whatsoever. That should be apparent to anyone with a pulse or an IQ better than a retarded ameba.”

On the recent Swiss National Bank move to remove the cap from the franc, Pento says, “It’s the steady erosion of the lack of faith we have as investors now in central banks and fiat currencies. In the case of the Swiss National Bank, they could no longer peg to the euro. Their currency dropped 12% against the dollar in one year. They did not want to suffer what was going to occur with the ECB’s (European Central Bank) decision for massive QE. It’s going to probably get announced on Thursday. If it doesn’t get announced, I will predict even more chaos.” If the ECB money printing is not big enough, Pinto says things will “blow up.” Pinto also says, “If they do print enough money, things are going to blow up. As I said, we have created a huge vacuum in markets.”

On central bank interventions that totally control global interest rates, Pento goes on to explain, “Now they own the entire yield curve. They own the entire sovereign debt market. If they ever stop and let the free markets come in, there’s going to be a vacuum, a sling shot in interest rates. They are going to go so high so fast that there will be no revenue left to service debt. That is the sad condition we have across the developed world.”

Pento, whose 2012 book titled “The Coming Bond Market Collapse,” predicts a collapse by 2016. Pento contends, “I think they are going to have to stop manipulating the entire yield curve once inflation becomes entrenched in the economy. Yes, we had inflation in home prices. They inflated the stock market to the moon and it’s unsustainable, and they created a huge bubble in bonds. But that didn’t translate automatically YET to rapid consumer inflation. . . . Once that happens, the central banks are going to have to stop printing, and that vacuum is going to be revealed. You will see interest rates are going to shoot up like a slingshot. If the U.S. had to pay just 7% interest on its national debt, and that’s the average going back to 1971, we would be insolvent. We would have to pay $1 trillion in interest payments every year. . . . If we had to pay $1 trillion a year in interest payments, it would be game over.”

On gold, Pento says, “Gold is going up in all currencies because investors are coming to this realization, or epiphany, that you cannot trust central banks. In 2008, we had the Great Recession. We had the bursting of asset bubbles. We had the bursting of the housing bubble. We had the bursting of the stock bubble. The Federal Reserve came in, and it was not only the Fed, we had central banks from across the world increase debt by 40%. 40% since 2008 on a global basis, and they took interest rates, which were already low, down to 0% and negative % and left them there for going on almost seven years. People had the audacity to believe that this was going to be a success story. They are slowly learning we have solved nothing. We have just made all the problems associated with the Great Recession much, much worse. As that realization unfolds, people will be flocking back into hard money, and that means gold.”

What will trigger the next financial meltdown? Pento says keep your eye on the land of the rising sun, heavily leveraged Japan. Pento predicts, “I think the Japanese central bank is absolutely going to destroy that currency. . . . When that unwinds you are going to see a massive wipeout of equity prices. That just metastasizes across the globe. It goes on to Europe, and it goes on to the United States, and it goes on to China. When we reset bond yields, prices collapse and yields go higher, I am talking about interest rates just going back to normal levels. Once that occurs, it’s game over. Can you imagine what the real estate market would do if interest rates went back to near 10%? What would the stock market do? What would the $100 trillion in interest derivatives do? The free market is gone. There is nothing left of it, and we put it all in the hands of these few people (central bankers) and they have screwed things up royally.”

“Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.” Romans 12:20

GAZIANTEP, Turkey — While U.S. warplanes strike at the militants of the so-called Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq, truckloads of U.S. and Western aid has been flowing into territory controlled by the jihadists, assisting them to build their terror-inspiring “Caliphate.”

The aid—mainly food and medical equipment—is meant for Syrians displaced from their hometowns, and for hungry civilians. It is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, European donors, and the United Nations. Whether it continues is now the subject of anguished debate among officials in Washington and European. The fear is that stopping aid would hurt innocent civilians and would be used for propaganda purposes by the militants, who would likely blame the West for added hardship.

“I am alarmed that we are providing support for ISIS governance,” says Jonathan Schanzer, a Mideast expert with the Washington D.C.-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “By doing so we are indemnifying the militants by satisfying the core demands of local people, who could turn on ISIS if they got frustrated.”

The Bible says if your enemy is hungry, feed him, and if he is thirsty, give him something to drink—doing so will “heap burning coals” of shame on his head. But there is no evidence that the militants of the Islamic State, widely known as ISIS or ISIL, feel any sense of disgrace or indignity (and certainly not gratitude) receiving charity from their foes.

Quite the reverse, the aid convoys have to pay off ISIS emirs (leaders) for the convoys to enter the eastern Syrian extremist strongholds of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, providing yet another income stream for ISIS militants, who are funding themselves from oil smuggling, extortion and the sale of whatever they can loot, including rare antiquities from museums and archaeological sites.

“The convoys have to be approved by ISIS and you have to pay them: the bribes are disguised and itemized as transportation costs,” says an aid coordinator who spoke to The Daily Beast on the condition he not be identified in this article. The kickbacks are either paid by foreign or local non-governmental organizations tasked with distributing the aid, or by the Turkish or Syrian transportation companies contracted to deliver it.

That sweet deal is coming to an end. U.S.-imposed sanctions will be applied to any of these countries that fails to halt oil imports from Iran by May Day (May 1).

The waivers, called Significant Reduction Exceptions, were granted after President Trump backed the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear pact, which we covered almost a year ago.

The Trump administration wants to cripple the Tehran pipeline where it really hurts: in the cash drawer.

The purpose of economic sanctions is to apply pressure in the global marketplace in order to “persuade” adversarial countries and their allies to “cooperate” with the first country’s demands. Measures taken may include travel bans, asset freezes, arms embargoes, capital restraints, foreign aid reductions, and trade restrictions.

These days, economic sanctions are often used as a substitute for war after failing to achieve a diplomatic solution.

Many analysts believe that economic sanctions, because they limit trade, are always a bad idea. But supporters point out that sanctions can work with no military combat. The secret to sanction success lies in its implementation.

Investopedia calls economic sanctions “a sort of carrot-and-stick approach to dealing with international trade and politics.”

The U.S. has been at odds with Iran for decades over demonstrated acts of terrorism as well as alleged, illegal nuclear proliferation. President Trump is now doubling down economic pressures to starve all nations that aid and abet terrorist activities, whether directly or indirectly.

China tops the U.S. list of targeted offenders. This huge nation, full of hungry consumers, purchases half of Iran’s oil. Not surprisingly, the Communist country “resolutely opposes the move” taken by the Trump administration to plug the flow of oil out of Iran.

“The cooperation between China and Iran is open, transparent, reasonable, and legitimate, which thus deserves respect,” rebutted Geng Shuang, speaking for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu joined the chorus against sanctions based on purchases of Iranian oil, saying, “Politically, it is not right. Ethically, it is not right. In terms of commerce, it is definitely not right.”

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a televised announcement:

“Any nation or entity interacting with Iran should do its diligence and err on the side of caution. The risks are simply not going to be worth the benefits.”

India, the second-largest buyer of Iranian oil, has stated officially that it will comply with U.S. demands to avoid sanctions. However, the country has a history of getting around U.S. restrictions by trading with their own rupee currency rather than U.S. dollars.

The other four countries facing U.S. economic sanctions within the next week or so have few options: negotiate, retaliate – or cheat. Compliance is also a problem, as Pompeo admitted:

“It will be hard for the U.S. administration to take action against private tankers that are owned by private companies that are foreign-flagged. It will cause diplomatic issues if they attempt to do that [cheat].”

Iran has responded by threatening to blockade the Strait of Hormuz – the only sea passage from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman to the Arabian Sea and the open ocean. Fully one-fifth of the world’s oil passes through this vital (and busy) seaway. The U.S. has promised to thwart any Iranian attempt to stop this watery trade route.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders wrote in an emailed statement the President’s goal in revoking special privileges for major buyers of Iran’s oil:

“This decision is intended to bring Iran’s oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue.”

Pompeo added that the U.S. wants to “incentivize Iran to behave like a normal country.”

Speaking for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, Abbas Mousavi explained that his country “basically gives no credit to exemptions from these sanctions” because the actions of the U.S., in this case, are illegal.

Taiwan, Italy, and Greece avoided the current international fracas by taking action to stop their imports of Iranian oil."

Tellingly, more than a year ago in May 2018, Google got rid of its unofficial “Don’t be evil” motto that had been part of the company’s corporate code of conduct since 2000.

On Monday, Sept. 9, 2019, attorneys general for 50 U.S. states and territories officially announced an antitrust investigation of Google‘s threat to competition, consumers and the continued growth of the web.

The Washington Post reports that the investigation is led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and seven other attorneys general, four Democrats and four Republicans in total. Every state except Alabama and California, the latter ironically the home of Silicon Valley, so far has signed onto the bipartisan effort, as have Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.

During a news conference on Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court with officials from 11 states and the District of Columbia, Texas AG Ken Paxton, a Tea Party conservative, said the probe’s initial focus is Google’s online advertising, but promised the probe would go wherever the facts lead. State officials already have sent Google official legal demands for documents related to the investigation of online ads.

According to eMarketer, Google is expected to rake in more than $48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, far rivaling its peers, while capturing 75% of all spending on U.S. search ads. Describing Google as dominating “all aspects of advertising on the Internet and searching on the Internet,” Paxton said “They dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and the video side with YouTube.”

The other attorneys general raised additional complaints about Google, from the way the company processes and ranks search results to the extent to which it may not fully protect users’ personal information:
• Sean Reyes, the attorney general of Utah, said “There’s nothing wrong with being a dominant player when it’s done fairly,” and that while there is a “presumption” of innocence in such an investigation, still there is a “pervasiveness” to complaints about Google’s business practices.
• Jeff Landry, the attorney general of Louisiana, added: “We’re here because there’s an absolutely existential threat to our virtual marketplace.”
• Ashley Moody, the attorney general of Florida, said the states’ Google probe starts with the company’s vast data stores: “Google monitors our online behavior, and captures data on every one of us as we navigate the internet. This investigation will initially focus on capture of that information and whether Google embedded itself on every level of the online market [for] ad sales to monopolize this industry.”
• Leslie Rutledge, a attorney general from Arkansas, described Google as an “online search engine juggernaut” and raised her concern that searches for businesses, including doctors, are colored by the way the tech giant’s algorithms and advertising systems work — “I want the best advice, from the best doctors — not the doctor, not the clinic who can spend the most on advertising.”

Six years ago, federal watchdogs wrapped up an antitrust investigation into Google’s search and advertising practices and opted against bringing major penalties against the company, including breaking it up. Regulators around the world, however, have been more skeptical of Google: The European Union has issued the company $9 billion in competition-related fines over the past three years.

The attorneys general’s investigation marks the latest regulatory headache for Google and the rest of Silicon Valley, which have faced growing criticism — and widening state and federal scrutiny — into whether they’ve grown too big and powerful, undermining rivals and resulting in costlier or worse service for web users. Other probes include:
• The Department of Justice and FTC also are scrutinizing Big Tech. DOJ has taken early interest in Google, and recently its first legal demand for records.
• Another group of 11 state attorneys general — led by New York’s Letitia James — has begun their own probe against Facebook, on whether it violates competition laws and mishandles consumers’ personal information.

Some state leaders said they are working closely with their federal counterparts as these investigations unfold. But Karl Racine, the Democratic attorney general for D.C. and a participant in both the Facebook and Google probes, said he and the other state attorneys general wouldn’t hesitate to forge ahead if Washington once again opts against taking action against the tech giants: “The state attorneys general, they are an independent bunch, and they can be quite tenacious. So I’m very confident that this bipartisan group is going to be led by the facts, and not be swayed by any conclusion, that may fall short, if you will, if it’s inconsistent with our facts, on the [federal] side.”

As Baucus himself repeatedly boasted, the architect of that legislation was Elizabeth Folwer, his chief health policy counsel; indeed, as Marcy Wheeler discovered, it was Fowler who actually drafted it. As Politico put it at the time: “If you drew an organizational chart of major players in the Senate health care negotiations, Fowler would be the chief operating officer.”

What was most amazing about all of that was that, before joining Baucus’ office as the point person for the health care bill, Fowler was the Vice President for Public Policy and External Affairs (i.e. informal lobbying) at WellPoint, the nation’s largest health insurance provider (before going to WellPoint, as well as after, Fowler had worked as Baucus’ top health care aide). And when that health care bill was drafted, the person whom Fowler replaced as chief health counsel in Baucus’ office, Michelle Easton, was lobbying for WellPoint as a principal at Tarplin, Downs, and Young.

Whatever one’s views on Obamacare were and are: the bill’s mandate that everyone purchase the products of the private health insurance industry, unaccompanied by any public alternative, was a huge gift to that industry; as Wheeler wrote at the time: “to the extent that Liz Fowler is the author of this document, we might as well consider WellPoint its author as well.” Watch the five-minute Bill Moyers report from 2009, embedded below, on the key role played in all of this by Liz Fowler and the “revolving door” between the health insurance/lobbying industry and government officials at the time this bill was written and passed. …"

All available data confirms that the last decade of record shattering drought in California was a direct result of covert global climate intervention programs. Now that the drought has been reduced or eliminated throughout much of the state, does this mean climate manipulation programs have been scaled back or halted? Not at all. The geoengineers control the flow of precipitation, that must be constantly kept in mind. A primary goal of ""solar radiation management"" (SRM) programs is to create, expand, enhance, and chemically cool (via chemical ice nucleation processes) cloud cover over the surface of the planet. Though the weather-makers have allowed and augmented the flow of Pacific moisture into the Western US this year (which has resulted in much more overall precipitation), the aerosol spraying assault and massive microwave manipulation of atmospheric moisture has continued to accelerate.

Significant zonal flows of moisture from the Pacific have in recent months been directed toward Northern California and the Northwest (as already stated), which contributed to significant precipitation totals. But, much of the moisture in these weather systems was in fact migrated over the West Coast in a desperate attempt by the geoengineers to cool inland regions of the US via atmospheric aerosol saturation and radio frequency/microwave transmissions (used to expand and disperse aerosolized cloud canopy). Short term toxic climate intervention cool-downs come at the cost of a worsened overall planetary warming. Climate engineering programs are not mitigation for Earth's imploding life support systems, rather, the ongoing weather warfare is further fueling the destruction of these systems.

The transmissions from the ""Lost Coast"" region of Northern California (southwest of Eureka) have become almost constant as the weather makers attempt to broadcast incoming rivers of moisture into the widest possible expanse. Transmission sites are located all over the country and all over the world. There are also SBX transmission facilities (sea based X-band radar which is also used for climate manipulation). New facilities are constantly being erected in a desperate attempt by the power structure to expand their weather modifying global radio frequency/microwave grid.

Not only are these extremely powerful transmissions completely disrupting weather and climate patterns, all life forms within the rapidly expanding broadcast zones are being exposed to these verifiably dangerous and damaging signals. What visible effect can the RF transmissions have on cloud system formations? The recently taken NASA satellite image below is an example. 90 degree angles with straight sides do not exist naturally in nature, such phenomenon are the result of massive geoengineering operations.

Yet another shocking example of radio frequency/microwave transmission effects is shown in the image below (also taken off the west coast of North America).

The combination satellite/radar image shown below was just captured. This image clearly reveals the climate engineering scenarios described in this article. The brighter the cloud cover is, the more aerosolized it is. ""Cloud albedo enhancement"" (CAE) is a component of climate engineering/SRM. Though official sources would have us believe that CAE processes are only a ""proposal"" for marine cloud formations that would be created with ship emissions, the ongoing jet aircraft aerosol dispersions in our skies are undeniable. The overall result of solar radiation management is vast areas of largely rainless cloud cover that blots out our once blue skies.

The creation of a ""global dimming"" scenario is a primary objective of geoengineering/SRM/CAE programs. Though overall atmospheric relative humidity has been declining as a result of climate engineering and global dimming (creating protracted drought in countless regions around the globe), catastrophic deluges and flooding are also increasing. The global climate engineering assault has completely derailed and disrupted the planetary hydrological cycle creating countless weather whiplash scenarios. The ongoing global climate engineering insanity must be fully exposed and halted, this is the great imperative. All of us need to make our voices heard in this most critical battle.

In the latest assault on the freedom to think for yourself, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has announced that YouTube will begin “correcting” controversial videos with “facts” from Wikipedia, an utterly discredited disinfo propaganda website run by pharma trolls who routinely demonize holistic medicine.

“Jimmy Wales and his army of liberal trolls will determine what’s truth and anything which goes too far in countering the narrative will be banned or censored,” warns Information Liberation. Wales, of course, is the former porn king who launched Wikipedia as a thought control “Ministry of Truth” to push big pharma quack science and pro-Monsanto propaganda.

Now, YouTube CEO Wojcicki believes that video content creators who dare mention “conspiracy” topics such as mercury in vaccines, chemtrails or the globalist depopulation agenda must be “corrected” with Wikipedia propaganda. The thought police are hard at work at YouTube, banning or censoring all the videos they don’t want you to see.

The new Wikipedia “corrections” will begin appearing on YouTube videos in the next two weeks, Wojcicki said in a SXSW speech. Notice her doublespeak as she explains how this is going to work:

“When there are videos that are focused around something that’s a conspiracy — and we’re using a list of well-known internet conspiracies from Wikipedia — then we will show a companion unit of information from Wikipedia showing that here is information about the event…”

“Companion” unit of information? What she means is that the YouTube thought police will “correct” the video to make sure the techno-dictatorship properly indoctrinates the minds of viewers with the official (false) narrative on everything. No independent thinking will be allowed on any subject that matters — climate change, the federal reserve, vaccines or science — without being intercepted and “corrected” by YouTube’s thought control monitors.

Yes, George Orwell’s 1984 has arrived, and it’s called “YouTube.” (Related: Read why I’m launching Brighteon.com as the answer to YouTube censorship.)

This announcement by the propagandist-in-chief Susan Wojcicki — who is rapidly becoming the Joseph Goebbels of the internet — reveals just how quickly YouTube is following in the footsteps of Communist China to control the perceptions and thoughts of its users. All the so-called “conspiracy theories” that will be “corrected” by YouTube, of course, are determined by radical left-wing indoctrination overlords who dominate the tech platforms. To these totalitarian lunatics, the idea that the Russians stole the 2016 election is a “fact,” but the idea that geoengineering experiments are being run to alter the atmosphere is a “conspiracy theory” (even though it’s now openly admitted by science-based universities such as MIT).

Read Geoengineering.news to see an expanding collection of stories on how geoengineering is now openly admitted by scientists. In fact, they’re claiming it’s necessary to “save the planet.”

Remember the real definition of a “conspiracy theory:” it’s anything the establishment doesn’t want you to know. By simply labeling real agendas and nefarious social engineering nothing but “conspiracy theories,” the tech gatekeepers can justify censoring all videos, articles or websites that mention them. Remember when the entire media said that Hillary Clinton’s neurological problems were a conspiracy theory? Or how about all those years in which anyone who accurately stated that your TVs were spying on you was also deemed a kook? Now, it’s common knowledge. See this article: Yes, your smart TV really is spying on you: Leaked docs reveal CIA secretly turned Samsung TVs into microphones that spy on your conversations.

Despite the inescapable truth on these matters (and many more), according to the thought control police at YouTube and Wikipedia, chemtrails are a “conspiracy theory” that needs to be corrected, just to make sure nobody actually believes it’s happening (even though it is).

This move by YouTube smacks of total desperation, and it follows in the footsteps of YouTube outright banning the entire Health Ranger channel in a last-ditch effort to silence rising voices that are warning humanity about the very same mind control agenda being demonstrated every day by YouTube itself.

Quite literally, YouTube will ban accounts by claiming those content creators are promoting “conspiracy theories” that claim YouTube is censoring accounts. Seriously, this is how insane things have become now as the techno-dictatorships are running wild, crushing not just the freedom to speak, but also the freedom to think.

This brazen move by YouTube demonstrates how dangerous Google and YouTube have become to modern society, functioning as biased censors of independent news, information and independent science. This is why YouTube, Google, Facebook and Twitter must be stopped. They must be aggressively regulated to halt their selective censorship agendas that specifically target independent journalism, independent science and real investigations into the creeping totalitarianism now unfolding all around us.

The 33,000 deaths brought about by these procedures are roughly equal to the annual number of deaths attributed to AIDS.""---Dr Whitaker, M.D.

This cap kept the two currencies roughly the same value–but not anymore. The move was such a surprise that even IMF Chief Christine Lagarde admitted the move by Swiss National bank (SNB) caught her off guard. It also caught currency traders by surprise as the Swiss franc soared by as much as 30%. Gold also spiked on the news. Why was this every-man-for-himself action taken by the SNB? It appears more money printing is coming, and this time it will come from the European National Bank (ECB.) It appears Switzerland wants protection from inflation.

My friend Gregory Mannarino from TradersChoice.net gave me his take today. Mannarino says the Swiss are getting ahead of an announcement that will probably come from the ECB next week that it, too, is going to embark on massive Federal Reserve style QE, or money printing. The Swiss did not want to print even more money to maintain the so called “cap” or peg that kept the two currencies basically the same value. That’s not all. Mannarino says the Euro will continue to plunge on the new probable money printing announcement, and that will produce a spike in the U.S dollar. As the U.S dollar moves up, the Fed will have the cover needed to bring it back down by introducing another round of money printing we affectionately call QE4.

Why would the Fed do this during a “recovery”? I’ll say it again, as I’ve said it a hundred times, there is no recovery! Look at this headline: “Consumer Spending Not in Line with Forecast.” That is putting it mildly. Here’s my headline: “Retail spending hit a wall and cratered in the fourth quarter.” Oh sure, oil prices have fallen and consumers are getting a little boost, but it will not make up for all the losses the big banks are going to have with the losses in energy and derivatives. Citi Group and JP Morgan are in deep trouble, and they are both going to need bailouts probably this year. Just Citi Group alone and its holding company have a combined $135 trillion in derivatives exposure. Citi Group’s earnings are tanking. Egon von Greyerz predicted QE4 before the end of the second quarter. My money says he’s right.

The U.S is not the only one having problems. Russia just cut off gas deliveries for six Eastern European countries. There has been a 60% cut in supply to Europe. This will cause even more financial problems in the Eurozone. It will be even more of a reason for the ECB to print money to bail out businesses and banks. We have all been waiting for the next Russian move, and no one should be surprised that January would not be the ideal month to cut supplies unless you were giving the Europeans some payback. Russia has been crippled with sanctions. Ukraine has been reportedly stealing Russian gas. What did they think Russia was going to do? My surprise is why it took so long. On top of that, Russia is dumping the dollar and leaving the petro dollar system. It is reportedly going to sell more than $88 billion in U.S. liquid dollar assets. It is going to get payment in rubles or no-dollar transactions.

Then, there is the news that Russia is adding to its “combat capabilities” in Crimea. The war in Eastern Ukraine is heating up, and it’s going to get hotter. The U.S. and NATO are also stepping up their presence in the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe in general. Everybody in leadership knows this is getting worse, but you are not hearing much on the mainstream media. Also, things are set to ratchet up in the Middle East with the President asking for troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. America’s top General Martin Dempsey told Congress recently that it would take “80,000 competent Iraqi security forces to recapture lost territory” and take back Iraq from Isis. There are probably less than 1,000 competent Iraqi troops. You know American boots are going to be on the ground, and that will be almost all of the forces needed to defeat the Islamic State terrorists. We are being set up militarily and financially for World War III. The only question is when.

Finally, anti-Islam protests are heating up in Europe after the Charlie Hebdo attack and a separate attack on a kosher market. There is no doubt there is a problem with radical Islam. There is Boko Haram in Nigeria where 2,000 were recently murdered. There are the more than 140 murdered in Pakistan by radical Islam late last year. There have been countless stories of atrocities with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It is clear there is a problem, and most of it comes from al-Qaeda related groups. If just 1% of the 1.6 billion Muslims are radical, that represents 16 million potential terrorists. Radical cleric Anjem Choudhury called the latest cartoon from Charlie Hebdo “an act of war,” but not all Muslims want violence. Case in point, did you know that a Muslim from Mali working in that kosher market in France saved the lives of six Jews, including a baby? He led the group to the freezer during the deadly attack, turned it off and told everyone to stay calm until the attack was over. He saved them. This story was reported in the Israeli press.

Megyn Kelly will no longer host a gala for the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation after backlash over her upcoming interview with InfoWars owner Alex Jones.

Sandy Hook Promise — which was founded by family members of some of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting — announced Monday that Kelly would no longer be hosting the annual Promise Champions Gala scheduled for Wednesday in Washington, D.C.

Kelly is facing backlash for her upcoming interview with Jones, a noted conspiracy theorist who believes the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting was a hoax and says 9/11 was an inside job.

“Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Nicole Hockley, co-Founder and Managing Director of the organization said in a statement.

 Green Party Stein is inviting Bernie to join her to increase both their winnability.

 The bigger picture of course is that there are more than a hundred million Americans more qualified to run their country, and much better than what the aforementioned wannabes could ever do. But fluoride, lead and aluminum have taken its toll on the population which made them docile.

 Scores are protesting chemtrails but nobody really is doing something to stop it beyond vibrating their vocal chords.

 A docile mind will never accept that it is docile and incapable of doing something decisive, of course. Some of them are waiting for the promised Green Light and the Mass Arrests up to now, but is it really forthcoming?

 The fact is: not everyone in the freedom movement agrees on a specific decisive action to put them all Khazarian Mafiosi in one FEMA camp. If they did, it would have been done by now.

 Some of them want to use the legal channel, but the legal channel has been coopted long time ago. Are they really that naïve?

 For their failure to act decisively, compromises were made with the Devil, i.e. Jesuits, UK Monarchy and the Rothschild. With these same groups on board, only the illusion of change could be possible.

 The West needs to solve their problem on their own, at least that’s what their self-appointed leaders in the freedom movement want their people to do. But Asia will do whatever it takes to insulate itself from what’s to come to the Western population.

 Now, the FBI White Hats are contemplating of going Anonymous in releasing their files on Hillary Clinton to shut this murdering bitch once and for all.

 

 Where does this lead to?

 Mere leaking of data doesn’t make the likes of Clinton go hiding.

 Even the victims of the deliberate nuking of WTC 911 have yet to receive justice for their dead loved ones even with all the billboards about its true story were already displayed across the United States.

 The Liars and Criminals don’t just go away, or put themselves to prison, or even hang themselves at the gallows. Somebody needs to do it.

 The freedom movement is betting on Donald Trump as being anti-establishment. Well, Obama was also anti-Bush when he was still begging for your votes.

 Trump may not be influenced by big corporate interests, but he is the Corporate Interest.

There aren’t many things upon which Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree, especially as they court very different Delaware voters ahead of a primary on Tuesday. But the candidates for president share an affinity for the same nondescript two-storey office building in Wilmington. A building that has become famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax through the so-called “Delaware loophole”.

So, if Donald Trump is unclean himself, to whom should America vote for?

 It’s not too late to look around for a man or woman of known political will, and whose public service record speaks for itself. Again, there are more than a hundred million Americans that should fit the bill.

 If the same method is possible in a smaller country like ours, it should be possible in the United States, too.

 This is what the Overseas Filipino Workers did to convince the mayor from “down under” to run for the presidency.

Now, Taiwan and Japan are both reporting that coronavirus is spreading in their countries from person to person, debunking earlier claims that human-to-human transmission isn’t a major concern with this outbreak.

Not long after German authorities confirmed that a Chinese woman passed coronavirus on to a male colleague of hers while in Germany, health officials both in Japan and Taiwan have now confirmed similar cases within their own borders, raising fears of exponential growth and a possible global pandemic.

In Japan, a male bus driver in his 60s who hasn’t traveled to China anytime recently is said to have contracted coronavirus from one of his tourist passengers. In Taiwan, a 50-year-old man was infected by his wife after she returned from a work trip to China.

This Taiwanese man is the eighth confirmed case of coronavirus in Taiwan, and the first known human-to-human transmission case in the island nation. Taiwanese officials have responded by telling people not to travel anywhere in China except for Hong Kong and Macau, after previously recommending against travel exclusively to the Hubei province where Wuhan is located.

As for Japan, officials there have sent a plane to Wuhan to evacuate its citizens from the disease-stricken mega-city. The United States has reportedly done the same, followed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.) issuing heightened warnings against all non-essential travel to China.

U.S. expands screening of travelers as coronavirus cases continue to soar

The U.S. is also implementing expanding screening protocols for travelers arriving from Wuhan to some 20 airports and other ports of entry all across the country, up from five previously.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) has upped its global risk assessment for this coronavirus outbreak from “moderate” to “high,” though this was done quietly without an official announcement.

At the same time, the W.H.O. continues to refuse declaring this coronavirus outbreak a global emergency, for which the agency has received much criticism. The official death count has now reached 130 people, with the official infection count steadily climbing well above 6,100.

As for the evacuation flight of Americans from Wuhan, this C.D.C.-ordered flight that was originally supposed to land in San Francisco, but that was redirected to Ontario International Airport in Southern California, was redirected again to March Air Reserve Base, also in Southern California.

The C.D.C. reportedly ordered this second diversion to the military base, but refused to publicly state why. The Department of Defense (D.O.D.), on the other hand, did issue a statement indicating that the Americans onboard the flight would be given housing at the base.

This implies a deliberate attempt to mislead the public and keep information secret.,"Cases of narcolepsy in children jumped 300 per cent following H1N1 vaccination campaign

Finland’s National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has suspended the use of the H1N1 vaccine over fears that the shot is linked with a 300 per cent increase in cases of the neurological disorder narcolepsy among children and young people over the last six months.

The news is sure to discourage more parents from vaccinating their children in the coming months, with the swine flu shot now being combined with the regular seasonal flu jab. A recent Rasmussen poll found that 52 per cent of Americans were concerned about the safety of vaccines as we approach the start of school and college terms, where many children and teenagers will be “required” to take shots before they can attend.

Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that can be triggered by a virus. “A patient suffering from narcolepsy may suddenly fall asleep, for example, while, speaking or eating without prior warning. Their muscles may also suddenly weaken, causing them to suddenly collapse. There is no known cure for the disease,” reports Finnish news website YLE.

“The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) decided on Tuesday to recommend that vaccinations against swine flu with the Pandemix vaccine should be suspended until it is established whether or not the vaccine is the cause of the surge in cases of narcolepsy among children and young people,” reports Finland’s largest newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.

Narcolepsy is a very rare disorder, but 15 new cases of the disease have emerged in young people and children since December in Finland. “There is a clear time correlation between the cases and the swine flu vaccinations,” reports Helsingin Sanomat. An unusually large number of cases of narcolepsy have also emerged in Sweden in the aftermath of the H1N1 vaccination program.

Pekka Puska, director-general of THL, said that the suspension would remain in place until the potential link between the vaccine and cases of narcolepsy could be properly investigated.

According to Kari Lankinen, head physician of the Finnish Medicines Agency, doctors were complicit in hiding the link between the swine flu shot and narcolepsy and did so to advance their careers.

“Lankinen suspects that the reason for the silence was the doctors’ concern about their own professional goals – such as getting their articles published in international medical journals. The doctors who made the observations in recent months now work with the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL),” reports YLE.fi.

In total, around 750 Finns have experienced harmful side effects as a result of taking the H1N1 shot, according to the Helsinki Times.

The news of yet more side-effects in the aftermath of the swine flu vaccination campaign should send another warning signal to parents across the world who are planning on having their child inoculated with seasonal flu vaccines this fall.

Both the FDA and the World Health Organization have recommendedthat the H1N1 shot be included with the upcoming seasonal flu vaccine, and health departments across America as well as Europe will be combining the jabs.

As we reported earlier this year, Chair of the Council of Europe’s Sub-committee on Health Wolfgang Wodarg’s investigation into the 2009 swine flu outbreak found that the pandemic was a fake hoax manufactured by pharmaceutical companies in league with the WHO to make vast profits while endangering public health.

Wodarg said that governments were “threatened” by special interest groups within the pharmaceutical industry as well as the WHO to buy the vaccines and inject their populations without any reasonable scientific reason for doing so, and yet in countries like Germany and France only around 6 per cent took the vaccine despite enough being available to cover 90 per cent of the population.

Wodarg said there was “no other explanation” for what happened than the fact that the WHO worked in cahoots with the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture the panic in order to generate vast profits, agreeing with host Alex Jones that the entire farce was a hoax.

He also explained how health authorities were “already waiting for something to happen” before the pandemic started and then exploited the virus for their own purposes.

Professor Ulrich Keil, director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Centre for Epidemiology, also slammed the swine flu epidemic as an overblown “angst campaign”, devised in conjunction with major drug companies to boost profits for vaccine manufacturers.

As Natural News’ Mike Adams reported, several members of the Emergency Committee expert panel that advised the World Health Organization (WHO) during the swine flu scare were receiving financial support from pharmaceutical manufacturers either during or prior to the epidemic.

Both H1N1 and seasonal flu shots have been linked with a number of different side-effects across the globe, including Guillain-Barré Syndrome as well as dystonia, a paralyzing neurological disorder.

The seasonal flu vaccine has also been linked with convulsions and fits in under-5’s.

Many batches of the swine flu vaccine included squalene and mercury amongst their ingredients, two substances that have been directly connected with the explosion of autism amongst children as well as other diseases. Individuals within government and the military were privileged to receive additive free shots that did not include these substances. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and government ministers, as well as German soldiers, were amongst those who received access to the so-called “friendly” version of the vaccine.

In order to head off legal claims for side-effects caused by the swine flu vaccination program, the U.S. government provided vaccine makers with blanket legal immunity before the shots began to be dispersed.

In his best Valley-Girl voice, Gates brags on video that he personally discouraged President Trump from inviting Robert Kennedy Jr to officially investigate the vaccine industry on behalf of the White House. Surely Gates neglected to fully inform Trump of the hundreds of thousands of lives he has ruined with his vaccines in “third world countries” – and that Gates’ organization has been banned in India due to the deaths, sterility and polio caused by its vaccines. And Gates might have not informed President Trump that he refuses to have his own children vaccinated – he knows the dangers. Someday it may be fully understood by all that Bill Gates’ cavalier attitude toward maiming and killing, depopulation by any means possible, belongs to a world-class psychopath.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke out about Bill Gates’s plan for mandatory global vaccination against the CCP Virus, citing the disasters caused in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people by his vaccination campaigns.

Bill Gates was criticized for not being a scientist or a politician and just for just using the power of his billions, he went on to determine the fate of the billions of people he intends to vaccinate.

Gates mentioned in recent interviews that the only solution to the current situation is a new universal vaccine.

“You know it’s so important to get, not just hundreds of millions, but literally billions of those vaccines, because this is a global problem,” Gates told CBS.

Kennedy, a lawyer, and environmentalist who opposes the controversial use of vaccines spoke out about Gates’s actions through his foundation.

“Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feeds his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and gives him dictatorial control over global health policy—the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism,” Kennedy accused in his Instagram account.

He also points out that Gates’s polio vaccination campaigns paralyzed 496,000 children in India between 2000 and 2017, causing his agency to be expelled from India and immediately lowering polio paralysis rates.

Other disastrous effects of Gates’s vaccinations were the autoimmune and fertility disorders that 1,200 girls suffered and the death of seven of them. They belonged to a group of 23,000 vaccinated girls from remote villages in India.

Among the resources used by Gates’s organization to enable the girls to be vaccinated were unethical practices such as pressuring girls to participate in the trial, intimidating parents, falsifying consent forms, and denying medical care to injured girls, according to the case now before the Indian Supreme Court, according to Kennedy.

Gates himself said at TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design) talk, “Now if we do a great job on new vaccines,” the world population could be reduced. A month earlier he had pledged $10 billion to the World Health Organization (WHO) for that purpose.

In 2014, the WHO was accused of sterilizing millions of women in Kenya, through deception, and the evidence was found in the vaccines used. The WHO admitted that it had been working on that project for more than 10 years. Similar charges have been brought against the WHO in countries such as Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines.

Gates is also accused of controlling international organizations such as the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI), and the international health organization PATH, in addition to using their money to advance their projects and silencing those who reject mass vaccinations.

In addition, the Gates Foundation, owned by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, is linked to more than 20 major international pharmaceutical companies and laboratories, to which it also donates money. These donations, which generate billions of dollars in tax deductions, create conflicts of interest.

While the preventive effects of vaccines are not in question, there are many complaints about the lack of transparency in their effects and content.

One of the most adverse components found in vaccines is mercury, such as thimerosal, a potent neurotoxin. In recent years children have received—through vaccines—doses of mercury 250 times higher than the safe limit for humans, unnecessarily.

There is also a high increase in autism in children. In 2014, 1.08 million children were diagnosed in the United States.

Dr. Doreen Granpeesheh, founder of the Center for Autism and Related Conditions in the documentary Vaxxed, explains that the incidence of autism in 1978 was 1 case per 15,000 children, very rare, and by 2014 was 1 case in every 50 children. By 2014, each child received about 46 vaccinations in the United States.

“Since the early 1990s the increase in cases has been so high and so rapid that it made me feel like I wasn’t going to be able to keep up,” Granpeesheh said.

It now it appears that Gates has found in the pandemic caused by the CCP Virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, an important opportunity to give a big push to the project he has cherished for decades."

These may all seem unrelated, but according to macroeconomic researcher Rob Kirby, they are all connected. Kirby explains, “With China and their upstart CIPS, which is the China Interbank Payment System, China appears to be on the verge of merging their interbank payment system with SWIFT. My gut is telling me that this will very much marginalize America as the main processor of global payments. This, in my view, will embody very possibly a global reset in terms which currency is going to be the world’s reserve currency. I have a very sneaking suspicion that when China merges with the SWIFT system, I believe there is a very strong possibility that China will back their currency with gold. I do believe this is why China has aggressively been buying physical gold for the past 10 or 15 years. They have been doing it with a view to dislodging the dollar or greatly diminishing the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. That’s what I think is at play right now. I think U.S. bankers and regulators have caught wind of this and are aware it is coming. I also believe this is the reason for all the secret meetings they have been having. The Federal Reserve Board met in secret behind closed doors (Monday morning), and they gave us some frivolous reason why they were meeting. The Fed Chairman, that Monday afternoon, walked over to the White House and met with, not just the President, but also the Vice President. The notion that the President and Vice President would be in the same room at the same time tells you this is national security related. If you don’t think the preservation of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency isn’t a national security issue, you better think again.”

Could there be a dramatic and overnight reduction in the value of the dollar? Kirby contends, “I think this is coming in very short order now. The trail of bread crumbs is indicating this is what is afoot right now.”

Does that mean dollar devaluation and a bank “holiday” coming soon? Kirby says, “How quickly this happens is open for conjecture, but that is clearly the direction we are heading. We are unmistakably headed in that direction. The only real question is how long these criminal central bankers can MacGyver the system together and keep it together with elastic bands, paperclips and bungie cords. This is going down. This is going to happen. I think it’s going down in the next two or three weeks. . . .We’ve all speculated that this would eventually happen. Now we are here, and the clock is about to strike midnight.”

What have the President and the VP been told by the Fed Chairman in these emergency meetings this week? Kirby says, “My guess is they are probably explaining to them just how deep the pooh is that they are about to be thrown into. It’s deep, and it’s going to be over their heads. . . . Historically, when banks have nothing else they can do, they take us to war.”

If they don’t take us to war? Kirby says, “Everything is on the table. . . . My thinking is there are an awful lot of U.S. dollars out there right now that are going to be coming home to America. . . . The adjustment in global reserve accounts could create a tsunami of dollars coming back to America in a very, very short period of time. That could trigger something approaching a hyperinflationary event or, at least, stagflation and super inflationary pressure. That’s the minimum occurring very, very soon.”

About the recent revelation of Deutsche Bank suppressing the price of physical gold and silver? Kirby points out, “The price rigging ultimately comes back to and will be shown that it really is an operation of the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve. . . . The short interests, or the paper sales of precious metals, have been used on purpose to suppress the growing demand for precious metals, or to make it appear that people are still happy with dollars and don’t prefer precious metals to dollars. . . . Whether the U.S. central bank declares that gold or silver are not money in some hubris filled silliness doesn’t diminish the fact that gold and silver are money, and your U.S. Constitution says gold and silver are money.”

 For manual elections, vote buying and physical intimidation are just some of them.

 

 Vote buying comes in different flavors, i.e. from distribution of canned sardines and few kilos of rice in rural areas, to promises of temporary employment in urban centers.

 For electronic voting, one can hack the machines used during Election Day, or even prior, in as easy as twisting a screw driver. This only involves swapping of memory cards, or ROM chips, containing predetermined results.

 Changing the ROM chips, to manipulate how each vote is counted, takes less than a minute.

Cordless screwdrivers will cut the hacking time in half..

 Here’s how to bypass the “security seal” of the voting machines to replace memory cards with new ones with predetermined results.

Prior to a carefully planned rigging of the elections, poll surveys will be used to precondition the minds of the electorate to the intended outcome. The rest of the critical elements of whole circus will be done by the media.

 Above all, the best indication that the whole system is rigged is when the population realize that their economic condition continues to worsen in spite of democracy.

 The best way to conduct a fool proof election is to physically divide the people on Election Day in such a way that everyone could see who’s voting whom, forcing everyone to make a stand for one’s choice.

 Another alternative is to wear the campaign color of the candidate to signify support of that candidate.

 Here’s how Duterte die-hards show their support by raising their fists and wearing red shirts while about to cast their votes at the Philippine embassy in Kuwait hosting absentee voting.

 Secrecy will always open the opportunity for rigging, and the cowards, who are not willing to stand by their own conviction and principles, always deserve the kind of government they have.

On the heels of a report by the Centers for Disease Control showing a drastic 78% increase in cases of autism in America since 2002 – a new study suggests that the food we eat might be responsible. The peer-reviewed journal, Clinical Epigenetics, links increased autism cases to the widespread use of high-fructose corn syrup in the American diet. As the study’s co-author, Dr. David Wallings, said, “To better address the explosion of autism, it’s critical we consider how unhealthy diets interfere with the body’s ability to eliminate toxic chemicals, and ultimately our risk for developing long- term health problems like autism.” – Thom Hartmaan radio program transcript

Free-Market Analysis: Here is a fairly predictable power elite meme. As vaccines come under more and more attack thanks to what we call the Internet Reformation, the powers-that-be are trying to find anything else to blame when it comes to rising autism rates.

Thom Hartmaan is a liberal radio commentator with a national following. From this report, it would seem that he has not presented the idea that vaccines cause autism, at least not regularly. He is presenting an alternative view, one we would suggest had been generated at least in part to cast doubt on the autism-out-of-vaccines linkage.

This is not surprising. Many in the media are sent various kinds of scientific studies addressing the startling rise in autism from numerous angles. It would seem to us that much of this is generated to confuse the issue.

There is surely evidence that vaccines cause numerous kinds of health damage – for certain people anyway. The elites behind the vaccine industry (and everything else, perhaps) are determined to ensure that vaccines are not implicated in autism damage.

The power elite seems to be run by dynastic families from the City of London, along with associates and enablers in politics, business, religion and the military. These elites seem to want to run the world and use fear-based promotions to frighten people into giving up power and wealth to globalist solutions.

Vaccines seem to be an integral part of these manipulations, from what we can tell. The ability to justify placing foreign substances into one’s body in mass programs is an integral part of the larger control over the public that the elites seek.

Recently, we were very surprised to find that no double-blind tests had ever been done on vaccines because of “ethical” reasons. This seems, in our humble opinion, to be a red flag. Also, we have observed how aggressively themainstream media has targeted, for instance, Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who intimated that there might be a link between autism and vaccines. You can see our recent articles here:

While the Wakefield pillorying continues – even though one of his partners was just exonerated of the charges for which Wakefield lost his British doctor’s license – the campaign to find an alternative substance continues. Here’s some more from the article:

According to the study – consuming high fructose corn syrup can lead to the loss of zinc in the body – making it more difficult for the body to rid itself of toxic metals like mercury and arsenic that have an adverse effect on brain development in children. Could studies like this deter major food corporations that are using high fructose corn syrup in their products to feed Americans? Probably not.

We can see here how the study is turned into an attack on private enterprise. There is nothing remotely defensible about high-fructose corn syrup, which is another corporate poison, from what we can tell. But the powers-that-be would gladly sacrifice corn syrup for vaccines. If autism can be blamed on corn syrup, then such a promotion would surely be mounted.

The Internet Reformation has dealt setbacks to numerous dominant social themes of late, including global warming,central banking and even the apparently phony war on terror. But the vaccine meme – if that’s what it is – would probably be the worst loss yet.

Access to the human body is of major import to the elites, apparently. The plan seems to be to place microchips into humans and animals at some point, and then to create even further human-mechanical elaborations. (Just Google “microchip programs in animals and humans to see for yourself.)

All of this is built on trust – the trust generated by massive vaccine programs that “protect” the common good. If this trust is jeopardized, then further public health programs are endangered as well.

Conclusion: While we used to believe in vaccines and vaccine programs implicitly, ‘Net information has made us increasingly doubtful. Finding out there were never any double-blind tests as regards vaccines was quite a shock. What else aren’t they telling us?

Did President Trump just nationalize the Federal Reserve Bank?

Note: We placed a machine translation of this article at the bottom of the blog

Sweet Movement of the Holy Spirit. This is a church group having service in a hospital parking lot, singing praises to God.

“Not everyone has got the fever, that is this panic fever, not the one caused by the Chinese coronavirus.

Our world is now firmly divided into two camps.
• There are those fully invested in the great panic over the virusand
• there are those who look at the other camp, gobsmacked by what appears to be a general madness.

Those in panic look at the rest of us the same way preppers look at normal people. They just assume the gods will strike us down for doubting the virus.

Of course, the people in the skeptic camp could be the ones suffering from some form of madness that prevents them from seeing the threat. The trouble is, the great plague is not exactly lighting up the scoreboard. America has tested over 600,000 people suspected of having the virus. Over 500,000 tested negative. Of the positives, 12,000 needed hospital care. In a country of over 320 million people with 200,000 empty hospital beds at any one time, that’s not much of a crisis.” Source

Weir contends there is one big question everybody should be asking. Weir says, “What’s the dollar going to be worth? What’s fiat money going to be worth after the banks crash?”

So, can the financial powers keep manipulating the U.S. dollar forever? Weir say, “I think they can, they have and they will as long as it is in the United States’ advantage. It’s been our advantage to run this un-backed fiat system. We have been the world’s reserve currency for a long time. Now, we are the largest debtor nation in the world. Now, we have all these problems with currencies. It’s turning into a place where it is no longer to our advantage. With the click of a mouse, we can end this game.”

It won’t just be a debt default, and Weir explains, “It will be a default on our monetary system. Yes, it is a default on our debt, but it won’t be just the U.S. It will be everybody, and it will be blamed on the banks. They have set it up that way. They gave the banks enough rope to hang themselves. What it’s going to do is get rid of all this debt. The biggest problem in the world now is debt. Some people are going to be very mad at the U.S. People are going to be very nationalistic, and it’s already started in the U.S. with Trump. We will become nationalistic, and we will shut our borders when this crash happens. This is the only way to get rid of the mess, and you and I know this mess is completely out of control. . . .There is no way out, and the idea was to never pay the debt.”

Weir also adds, “I talk about this a lot, and this comes directly from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and it comes from a 1960’s Nobel Prize winning paper, and it says the only way to get back to a gold standard is to print money in the largest amounts as you can—to infinity and collapse the system, and then go back to the gold standard. That’s what they’ve been doing.”

It won’t be an easy transition. Weir says it all starts with “a mass awakening followed by chaos.” Weir contends, “People keep asking how will the people wake up? . . . . The moment that happens is when the banks fail, and they go to their ATM’s. . . . They are going to be very angry. . . . They will believe these banks will have stolen their life savings. That’s when people will wake up in mass amounts.”

Weir says that will, no doubt, lead to chaos and asks, “The question is how much chaos. The U.S. has had plans to deal with this since the 1970’s.”

The “chaos will lead to transition,” according to Weir, and we will have a “We the People moment.” Weir explains, “It will be played out on TV in front of Congress. . . . If Congress approves another bailout, the apparatus will stay in place and . . . all of our freedoms and liberty will be gone. . . . When people lose their checking accounts and savings accounts, they are going to say you are not going to bail out anybody—especially the banks. . . .You can kiss it all goodbye, and then we get to start fresh.”

When all this happens you should have physical gold and silver—especially silver. Weir explains, “Silver has been used as money for 5,000 years, even more than gold has been used as money. Above ground silver and above ground gold are about 6 billion ounces each—total. Why is there an 80 to 1 ratio in price of silver to gold? It’s the computers and the market rigging that has been going on since the 1970’s. . . .Silver will be the last released in manipulation because it is so important. It’s a national security issue. . . . The price of silver today in U.S. dollar terms should be one to one with the price of gold. After the shakeout it will be a 4 to one ratio.” (The price for both will be much higher in dollar terms according to Weir.)

COVID-19 infection rates are allegedly falling in states that have lifted their coronavirus lockdown orders, according to a new study.

Research from investment bank JP Morgan shows infection rates actually decreasing - rather than increasing as some warned - after lockdown measures had ended.

JP Morgan's study was outlined by CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla in a lengthy Twitter thread.

The research appears to counter the warnings from media and political figures.

Many have been predicting dire consequences for those states when coronavirus lockdown measures began lifting.

In his analysis, Quintanilla described JP Morgan's findings as ""devastating.""

“JPMorgan has a devastating piece arguing that infection rates have declined — not increased — in states where lockdowns have ended, ‘even after allowing for an appropriate measurement lag.’ (Kolonavic),” Quintanilla said on Twitter.

Quintanilla’s next tweet included similar patterns “for various countries,” opining that “the pandemic and COVID-19 likely have its own dynamics unrelated to often inconsistent lockdown measures that were being implemented.”

The CNBC anchor then quoted from the research with his next several tweets, according to The Daily Caller.

The first of which contended that, while the lockdowns may have been “justified initially,” policymakers did not take into account the “millions of lives” that “were being destroyed … with little consideration that [lockdowns] might not only cause economic devastation but potentially more deaths than COVID-19 itself.”

JP Morgan opined about the partisan divide surrounding the ongoing response to the epidemic:

The news comes as many citizens in states across the country are questioning the necessity of statewide lockdowns.

A central California city has defied its Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom's statewide lockdown order by declaring itself a ""sanctuary city"" that won't enforce the state's measures.

The Californian city of Atwater has declared itself a ""sanctuary city for businesses"" and will allow reopenings, despite the state's shutdown order.

The resolution was passed Friday by the Atwater City Council.

Under the city's new status, business owners will be allowed to open and individuals can openly defy the Democratic governor’s coronavirus-related stay-at-home order.

The resolution asserts “the city’s commitment” to provide “fundamental” human rights to its residents."

Liberal pushback against Trump's presidency is rooted in more than just meltdowns

Ever since Donald Trump's 2016 election victory was first announced, triggering liberals everywhere, Trump Derangement Syndrome has been widespread in America.

President Donald Trump is waging all-out war against progressive culture, in a magnitude comparable to what 19th-century Germans once called a Kulturkampf.

This perceived attack has resulted in levels of hatred directed at Trump from the left that not even former President George W. Bush incurred.

President Trump's family, his friends, and his businesses have been investigated, probed, dissected, and constantly attacked for most of his time in office.

Former President Obama's appointees in the FBI, CIA, and DOJ tried to subvert the Trump campaign in 2016 before interfering with his transition in 2017, and, ultimately, attempting to cut short his presidency.

Now, congressional Democrats have pushed impeachment and are calling on the Senate to remove Trump from office before the 2020 election.

The usual reason for such hatred is said to be Trump’s unorthodox and combative take-no-prisoners style, according to The Daily Signal.

Critics detest his crude and unfettered assertions, his lack of prior military or political experience, his attacks on the so-called bipartisan administrative state, and his intent to roll back the entire Obama-era effort of “fundamentally transforming” the country leftward.

Certainly, Trump’s agenda of closing the border, using tariffs to overturn a half-century of Chinese mercantilism, and pulling back from optional overseas military interventions variously offends both Democrats and establishment Republicans.

He apparently does not care whether the departed write damning memoirs or join his opposition.

He will soon appoint his fourth national security adviser within just three years.

To make things worse for his critics, Trump’s economy is booming as never before in the new 21st century: near record-low unemployment, a record number of Americans working, increases in workers’ wages and family incomes, low interest rates, low inflation, steady GDP growth, and a strong stock market.

Yet the real source of Trump derangement syndrome is his desire to wage a multifront pushback—politically, socially, economically, and culturally—against what might be called the elite postmodern progressive world.

Contemporary elites increasingly see nationalism and patriotism as passé.

The European Union, not the U.S. Constitution, is seen as the preferable model to run a nation.

Transnational and global organizations are wiser on environmental and diplomatic matters than is the U.S. government.

The media can no longer afford to be nonpartisan and impartial in its effort to rid America of a reactionary such as Trump, given his danger to the progressive future.

America’s ancient sins can never really be forgiven.

In a new spirit of iconoclasm, thousands of buildings, monuments, and statues dedicated to American sinners of the past must be destroyed, removed, or renamed.

A new America supposedly is marching forward under the banner of ending fossil fuels, curbing the Second Amendment, redistributing income, promoting identity politics and open borders, and providing free college, free health care, and abortion on demand.

An insomniac Trump fights all of the above, nonstop and everywhere.

In the past, Republican presidents sought to slow the progressive transformation of America but despaired of ever stopping it.

No slugfest is too off-topic or trivial for Trump.

Sometimes that means calling out former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for persuading NFL stars to kneel during the national anthem.

Sometimes Trump enters cul-de-sac Twitter wars with Hollywood has-beens who have attacked him and his policies.

Trump variously goes after Antifa, political correctness on campus, the NATO hierarchy, the radical green movement, Planned Parenthood, American universities, and, above all, the media—especially CNN, The Washington Post, and The New York Times.

For all the acrimony and chaos—and prognostications of Trump’s certain failure—a bloodied Trump wins more than he loses.

NATO members may hate Trump, but more are finally paying their promised defense contributions.

In retrospect, many Americans concede that the Iran deal was flawed and that the Paris climate accord mere virtue-signaling.

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation proved fruitless and was further diminished by Mueller’s bizarrely incoherent congressional testimony.

Some of the most prominent Trump haters—Michael Avenatti, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Anthony Scaramucci, and Rep. Adam Schiff —either have been discredited or have become increasingly irrelevant.

Trump has so enraged his Democratic adversaries that the candidates to replace him have moved farther to the left than any primary field in memory.

They loathe Trump, but in their abject hatred, he has goaded the various Democratic candidates into revealing their support for the crazy Green New Deal, reparations for slavery, relaxed immigration policies, and trillions of dollars in new free stuff.

In a way, the left-wing Democratic presidential candidates understand Trump best.

If he wins his one-man crusade to stop the progressive project, they are finished, and their own party will make the necessary adjustments and then sheepishly drift back toward the center.

Tammy Faye Bakker (1942-2007) had an unbiblical view of homosexuality...

Is that what the Bible says? No, not at all.

I'm not trying to be unkind or mean, but the Bible does not teach for believers to turn a blind eye to public wickedness (Ephesians 5:11). Notice that Tammy Faye doesn't provide any Scriptural support for her position on homosexuality. Homosexuality is a horrible sin; just like abortion, adultery, bowing to statues of saints, stealing, taking God's name in vain, dishonoring your parents, et cetera. Homosexuals claim that they want churches to embrace them with God's love, speaking of unity and love for all people; yet homosexuals also want pastors, Christian leaders and pastors to remain silent about the sin of homosexuality. This is the problem!!! 



Ephesians 5:1-8 plainly, irrefutably, without argument, evidences Scripturally that Tammy Faye Bakker is WRONG...

The following Scriptures forbid all sorts of sexual immorality...

The following Scriptures use even stronger language, condemning homosexuals, whoremongers and sexually unclean people; saying that they have no inheritance in God's kingdom, and God's wrath is upon them...

The following Scriptures put Tammy Faye Bakker to shame, because she united with them and supported their wicked lifestyle and agenda...

The homosexual community exploited Tammy Faye, as they do others who are religious phonies. 2nd Timothy 3:1-5 warns about religious fakes who would commit all sorts of wickedness while masquerading as true believers; but 2nd Timothy 3:5 says they deny the power thereof. Romans 1:16 tells us that the power of God unto salvation is the Gospel.

Satan is a professional liar (John 8:44) and thief (John 10:10). Satan knows that the best way to corrupt society is to destroy the morals and faith in God of its youth (i.e., tomorrows adults). To do this, Satan must go after the churches, to corrupt them. So he starts by removing the word “sodomite” from the Bible completely (such as the New International Version [NIV]). By the way, homosexuals are excited about the NIV2011, just as they were about the original NIV because it removed the word sodomite (and had at least 2 professed Sodomites on the translating committee).

A true man of God will preach against all sin, including homosexuality. Every Christian believer is commanded to hate evil (Psalm 97:10). Romans 3:18 speaks of those who have no fear of God. Romans 3:18, “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” Those who fear God know that homosexuality is a sin that brings the judgment of God (Romans 1:32). Tammy Faye catered to the homosexual community; being a high-profile figure, she helped their agenda, which is why she was greatly praised in 2007 by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force after she passed away.

Although it is certainly true that we ought not condemn one another (James 4:11-12; Romans 14:10); we ought to teach that the Bible condemns sin (Romans 3:19). God's Law condemns all mankind as dirty, guilty, hell-deserving sinners (Romans 3:10). There are many deceivers in the world today. 



Despite the bad things everyone says about Tammy Faye Bakker (1940-2007), and the shame she brought upon the name of Christ; there is a silver lining and something we can all learn from her about forgiving those who hurt us...

The infamous Tammy Faye Bakker of the now defunct P.T.L. (praise the Lord) Club. She divorced her husband while he was in prison for misappropriating funds from P.T.L. contributors, to pay off a woman whom he had an affair with; and then Tammy became a spokeswoman for the lesbian Movement.

Users who want to visit websites that expose the scientifically-validated risks and potential harm of vaccines, chemotherapy, glyphosate or GMOs will have to switch to alternative browsers and search engines, since the Google.com search engine is already in the process of eliminating all such websites from its search results.

Within a year or so, the Google Chrome browser won’t even allow a user to visit sites like NaturalNews.com without changing the browser’s default settings. The only websites accessible through Chrome will be those which are “approved” to promote mass medication, chemotherapy, pesticides, vaccines, fluoride, 5G cell towers and other poisons that enrich powerful, globalist corporations while dumbing down the population.

This is the conclusion from a high-level source that told Natural News months ago about the coming purge of organics and natural health websites from Google — a purge that accelerated last week with the removal of Mercola.com and thousands of other natural health sites from Google search results.

The situation has become so insane that now Google is pushing search suggestions like “organics is a lie” and “supplements are bad.” Google’s algorithm has already been trained to claim that “GMOs are good” and “chiropractic is fake.” See the shocking proof here.

The hemorrhagic fever called Ebola is another of the virus myths being used by government medical quacks to bilk the public of tax funds and to keep the tax money flowing into the CDC/NIH.

Over the entire world, for the past 26 years, Ebola has allegedly claimed only 1000 victims [the death rate is 80%]. The big lie is that Ebola was first seen in 1976. The fact is that hemorrhagic fever is probably as old as .

1000 victims over 26 years worldwide shouldn't attract anyone's attention and should be proof enough to anyone with common sense that the investigation of such a rare condition has little to do with the public health. It's rarity also proves that it could not possibly be caused by a critter capable of producing an ""infectious"" disease.

Only a fool in a white lab coat, working at taxpayer expense would waste time on such a project. Hemorrhagic fevers have been known throughout history, there is nothing new about Ebola except the name.

And keep in mind that not one single degenerative disease has ever cured by a prescription drug and not one single epidemic disease has ever been prevented, cured or even ameliorated by a vaccine.

is the culprit in Ebola. This little critter, allegedly ""attacks"" fat platforms called lipid rafts that float on top of the membranes of cells. That's odd?? Since a virus is not alive [not one single virus has ""life"" or ever was ""alive""] how in the world can it ""do"" anything, much less ""attack"" something? The promoter of that outlandish scientific garbage is Eric Freed of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the NIH in .

The medical quacks at the NIH are great siphoners of hard earned tax money and tireless inventors of highly profitable [for themselves and the drug lords] quack remedies. AIDS is one of their greatest achievements - thousands have succumbed and given their lives unnecessarily based on that myth.

Another partner of Greed in the white collar criminal activities of government sponsored, tax supported quacks is Gary J Nabel of the Vaccine Research Center at NIAID who is actually reported by the WSJ and MSNBC as partnering with Vical Inc. of San Diego to produce a vaccine for the Ebola nonsense. ""Partnering"" with a vested interest? That's a strange word for a situation involving a government researcher allegedly working for the public good!

How can the public protect themselves against such fraudulent, dangerous, criminal activity when investigative journalists fail to expose these shenanigans?

Chase quotes Dr Nabel as saying that people are waiting with bated breath for a drug or vaccine against Ebola, a disease that claimed less than 40 a year worldwide for 26 years. If Dr Nabel actually uttered the ""bated breath"" quote, he is not only a fool but a colossal liar.

Write and call your representatives....protest this ridiculous, fraudulent, quack activity."

“JFK and the Fed” by G. Edward Griffin

Economic Report of the President, January 1963 (pg. XXIII on “Silver”)"

“But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” Daniel 12:4 (KJV)

We have gotten to used to communicating on Facebook that we no longer see it for the prophetical fulfillment it truly is. As of this writing, Facebook has 1,860,000,000 daily users posting and reading content around the globe, and is growing at a rate of 17% each year. Is short, it is the single greatest communication device ever conceived by mankind, second only to the Internet itself.

In an article titled “Can Facebook Fix It’s Own Worst Bug?” author Farhad Manjoo poses the question, “Mark Zuckerberg now acknowledges the dangerous side of the social revolution he helped start. But is the most powerful tool for connection in human history capable of adapting to the world it created?”

Facebook and Oculus Want Your Head and Hands in Virtual Space

Zuckerberg highlighted Facebook’s “safety check” feature which allows users to publicly acknowledge that they’re safe during dangerous events. Zuckerberg later expanded on this, describing a “global superstructure to advance humanity.” Zuckerberg stated, “we’re getting to a point where the biggest opportunities I think in the world … problems like preventing pandemics from spreading or ending terrorism, all these things, they require a level of coordination and connection that I don’t think can only be solved by the current systems that we have.”

The author of the article states, “What’s needed, he argues, is some global superstructure to advance humanity.”

The prophet Daniel states that “knowledge will increase” in the end times, and people will “run to and fro”. In Facebook, nearly one-third of all humanity “visit” with each other every day. Without leaving your computer, you can virtually travel to and spend time with anyone on your friends list. You can see their photos, watch their videos, and then tap to open Messenger and call them all without ever leaving Facebook. Soon, Virtual Reality devices developed by Facebook will let you interact in 3-D.

And now the person that created the single-largest communication device in human history is calling for a One World Government. Living in the end times is a lot like living in a city with a lot of smog. When I lived in Los Angeles, I could not see the smog no matter how thick it got because I was in the middle of it. But on my way back from the beach, and viewing LA from a distance, I could clearly see the ring of smog choking the city.

And so it is with Bible prophecy. Viewed from a distance you have clarity, but when you live in a time where it’s being fulfilled it is much harder to discern what’s happening. But God’s people know what’s going on.

While this has some truth, it’s nowhere near the whole truth.

What they’re not telling you is that in addition to crystals, these lofty contrails also contain byproducts of engine exhaust like nitrogen oxides, sulfate particles and deadly carbon dioxide. What’s worse is that they may also be carrying chemical substances being used for unknown government experiments.

Of course, the EPA and the mainstream media have issued fact sheets claiming that these contrails are harmless, in an effort to cover up these experiments. Don’t believe it.

No article on this subject can be complete without including the role of the last six Popes in this New World Order business plan. (I left out the one that only lived 33 days in 1978). Since 1958 each Pope has rejected the primacy of Roman Catholicism and embraced the ecumenical policy called 'interfaith dialog'.



I know most modern people think that's about 'brotherly love', peace and understanding, but the fact remains that the religions and denominations contradict one another. When a pope says as John Paul II did that 'all religions worship the same God' he was coming from the pantheist paradigm of the United Nations. His stated goal ""to place the (Catholic) Church at the heart of a new religious alliance that would bring together Jews, Muslims and Christians in a great armada"". Any religious person knows that every one of these religions would have to reduced to cultural meaninglessness to become one same thing. Strip the religions to ""unity"" and what you get is pantheism - ie, ""I am he and you are me and we are we and we are all together"" like the Beatles song. When I don't know God from a bowl of cat food, or the cat, or a goldfish, or the trees - that's pantheism.



Those in North America and Europe who assume the Vatican Church is gradually fading away don't factor in the massive rise in converts in lower Africa and Southeast Asia. These very populations are also streaming into North America and parts of Europe. The unspoken fact is that the Illuminati cult in control of the Vatican since 1958 have been deliberately chasing Europeans away, because we can figure out the New Church is counterfeit. The ""emerging Church"" of new converts is along the lines of pantheist perception and ""charismatic"" expression. (the ""false fire"" of mass hypnotism and demonic obsession).



As the Jaques Attali article yesterday noted, NWO Globalism was designed to created economic and other refugees who must perpetually be moving from zone to zone in pursuit of a living wage. The ""native"" populations - currently indigenous Europeans and Europeans that settled North America have already dropped below the necessary birth rate to maintain their majority in their own countries - due to abortion as birth control and temporary self-sterilization with birth control pills or shots."

Former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) slammed “elites” in an interview broadcast Sunday for not knowing how to deal with the Trump administration’s decision to freeze government aid to Pakistan.

“It has so thoroughly shocked the elites that we actually are going to protect America, and defend America, and that we’re actually going to render judgement,” Gingrich told radio host John Catsimatidis in an interview on AM 970 in New York.

“That is such a shocking moment for a lot of our elites that they don’t know how to deal with it.”

The former Speaker’s comments came days after the Trump administration announced that it would suspend nearly all security aid to Pakistan, potentially affecting as much as $1.3 billion in annual aid, according to The New York Times.

Mannarino says, “We understand there is a dynamic that has been changing here in the market with regard to the Fed’s purchasing mortgage-backed securities and bonds. This has rattled the emerging markets. They’re having problems with their currencies . . . The Federal Reserve has created an environment of distortions. By them pulling back some of this liquidity from the global economy, they’ve caused problems in these emerging markets, and this is being done on purpose.” What is the Fed trying to accomplish by destabilizing emerging market countries? Mannarino claims, “So, by rattling the emerging markets here, they are going to force investors into U.S. equities and into the U.S. bond market. It’s sort of a backdoor stimulus. . . . This just keeps the party going. That’s all this is.”

This may work in the short term, but it is not long term bullish for the markets. Mannarino warns, “We have this issue with the U.S. economy. They have been force feeding us nonsense . . . that we are in some kind of recovery. . . . This ISM number we got (Institute of Supply Management), we have not seen a pullback like this since 1980. It rattled the market. . . . We’re also getting mediocre earnings reports. We got unemployment numbers that are not good. So, this is spooking the market.” Looking at the big picture of the global economy, Mannarino goes on to say, “I am still a bull here in regards to the U.S. equity markets, but we all know where this is going. This is going to end terribly at some point. A complete financial meltdown is happening. You can see this already how the Federal Reserve has distorted this beyond the point of ridiculousness. Now, they are forcing the emerging market investor to look to the U.S. equity markets. At some point, people are going to see this whole thing is not sustainable. We are going to have a crisis of currency, a crisis of debt that is going to rock the core of the earth—period.”

This is a confidence game according to Mannarino. He says, “This is all about perception, not reality. If we were really in some type of a recovery, would we be talking about extending unemployment benefits for people? Would we be talking about more stimulus? Of course not, because there is no recovery. This is just smoke and mirrors across the board.” Don’t expect the market to plunge just yet because Mannarino says, “The Fed is counting on turmoil in the emerging markets to drive money into the U.S. market to keep the system propped up.”

Mannarino contends what you are seeing now is just a short term trade. In the longer term, Mannarino predicts, “Without a doubt, this is going to blow up. . . . I’ve been saying this for years now–we are headed for a pan global financial cataclysm. That’s a fact.” So, how does Mannarino plan to protect himself from this surefire coming calamity? Mannarino says, “I pull my gains out of the market, and I turn them into hard assets. I am the biggest precious metals bull out here. I can’t imagine a better place to be than in gold or silver, especially silver.”

OK everyone, it’s official, we are absolutely living in an end times novel with new and wacky end times things happening nearly every day now. Today’s offering is Pope Francis backing a call from the United Nations Secretary-General for all nations of the world to lay down their arms, end all conflict, and unite under the twin banner of the United Nations and Rome. Do you still think that the coronavirus pandemic is really about a virus? It’s not.

“Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” Zephaniah 3:8 (KJB)

Don’t get me wrong, the COVID-19 coronavirus is real, and real people are really dying, and from the beginning I have urged people to take all necessary precautions to protect you and your loved ones from getting the infection. Trump’s own expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci said today he expects 100-200,000 Americans to die from the coronavirus. It’s no joke, but that said, it is also a trojan horse that is being used to usher in the New World Order. Anytime you see the United Nations talking about anything, be suspicious, anytime you see the United Nations collaborating with the Roman pope, open your bible and start reading.

The United Nations is foretold in scripture, just as the Roman church who will lead the One World Religion is also foretold within the pages of prophecy. Keep one eye on the United Nations and the other on Rome, mischief is afoot.

Pope Francis Backs U.N. Chief: Wants Global Ceasefire to Help Stem Coronavirus

FROM BREITBART NEWS: Speaking at his weekly blessing in rome, delivered from the papal library instead of St. Peter’s Square because of the lockdown in Italy, Francis specifically mentioned the appeal Guterres made earlier in the week.

Saying the disease knows no borders, Francis wants everyone to “stop every form of bellicose hostility and to favour the creation of corridors for humanitarian help, diplomatic efforts and attention to those who find themselves in situations of great vulnerability”.

Did you know that the bible tells us that in the end of times, God will “gather the nations together” so they can be judged? That’s why it is no coincidence that just before the regathering of the nation of Israel in 1948, you had all the nations of the world gathering in the United Nations General Assembly.

As Breitbart news reported, Guterres made his call via a virtual digital news conference, adding that as well as an end to war the U.N. would like $2 billion to be transferred from wealthy countries to the poor via the globalist body as a first step in tackling the health challenge.

“Meanwhile, armed conflict rages on around the world,” Guterres said, adding that health networks in “war-ravaged countries” have collapsed and now is the time for talk not hostilities.

More than 662,700 people have now been infected by the virus across the world and 30,751 have died, according to a Reuters tally. About a third of the deaths have been in Italy, where the toll passed 10,000 on Saturday, a figure that made an extension of a national lockdown almost certain. Confirmed cases in Italy stood at 92,472, the second-highest number of cases in the world behind America.

In the space of 48-hours the U.S. death toll from the pandemic passed 2,000 late Saturday, figures confirm. Of those fatalities, 672 have been counted in New York City alone, as Breitbart News reported. READ MORE

Prins explains, “So, when the Fed says they are going to remove assets from their $4.5 trillion book by not reinvesting the interest payment . . . the reality is they haven’t really done that. They have reduced their book by about $10 billion off of $4.5 trillion since they mentioned they were going to start ‘tapering.” The media discusses this as a major tightening move. Somehow all of our economies have finally worked because of central bank activity. Growth is real. It’s all positive. The markets are evidence of that because of the levels they are at; and, therefore, these central banks, starting with the Fed, are going to reverse course of these last 10 years. The reality is if you look at the actual activity of the central banks, beyond the Fed raising rates by a little bit, there hasn’t been and there isn’t being a reversal of course because they are scared to death that too much of a reversal is going to cause a major crash throughout the financial system. Everything is connected. All the banks are connected. Money flows around the world in less than nanoseconds, and all of it has the propensity to collapse if that carpet the central banks have created is dragged from beneath the floor of all this activity.”Prins, who just finished traveling the globe to research her upcoming book, thinks there is one big thing that can take the entire system down. Prins, a former top Wall Street banker, contends, “There hasn’t been any real growth in the real economy. That is an indication of the misfire of this entire plan. There has been tremendous growth in stock markets and bond markets. If you look at localities or states or governments whose debt to GDP levels are well over 100%, in Japan it’s over 200%, in the United States it over 100%, and this is the same throughout the world. These are levels that they have never been, and they are all at their historic highs. That’s why debt will ultimately be the destructor of the system. In order for that to happen, the cheapness of money that allow states, municipalities and corporations to continue to borrow at these cheap levels has to go away. . . . At some point, there will be a mistake. There might be a tiny smidge of an interest rate hike at some central bank, probably the Fed, which ripples throughout the system as a mistake, not because real growth has happened, and that’s why interest rates have been raised. That will incur defaults throughout the system. People will incur personal defaults, and that will cause problems in the mortgage market . . . then it becomes a knock-on credit crisis, and then banks start not to lend . . . . Then we have the makings of a broad crisis.”

Official agencies have received thousands of complaints from people who have demanded an explanation. The existence of chemtrails has been repeatedly denied by scientists around the world, who say the trails are normal contrails. The United States Air Force states that the theory is a hoax which “has been investigated and refuted by many established and accredited universities, scientific organizations, and major media publications”.

The term chemtrail is derived from “chemical trail”, in the similar fashion that contrail is a portmanteau of condensation trail. It does not refer to other forms of aerial spraying such as crop dusting, cloud seeding, skywriting, or aerial firefighting. The term specifically refers to aerial trails allegedly caused by the systematic high-altitude release of chemical substances not found in ordinary contrails, resulting in the appearance of characteristic sky tracks. Supporters of this conspiracy theory speculate that the purpose of the chemical release may be for solar radiation management, population control, weather control, or biological warfare/chemical warfare and claim that these trails are causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems. source – Wikipedia

Mystery Illness on the rise in New York

A 36-year-old nurse practitioner has been diagnosed as the first adult to have the mysterious Tourette-like illness that has spread across a rural New York town.

Marge Fitzsimmons, who works with developmentally disabled patients and has no immediate ties to the town’s high school at the centre of the outbreak, has had to stop going to work because her body tics and twitches have gotten so severe that she can no longer work with her patients.

Details of her condition emerged today as researchers offered a new explanation for the strange symptoms that have been diagnosed in 14 teenage girls and one teenage boy. School administrators would not disclose exactly what they think the cause is but have insisted it is not a case of mass hysteria and that none of the girls are making the illness or symptoms up.

A new study released by the Centers for Disease Control concluded that Morgellons – a disease that causes patients to sprout painful sores – exists only in the patients’ minds, much like early hypotheses that the Le Roy teenagers suffered from ‘mass hysteria.’

Sufferers of the mystery illness describe a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, erupting sores, crawling sensations on their skin and – perhaps worst of all – mysterious red, blue or black fibers that sprout from their skin. Earlier this month, the school held a forum for concerned parents. About 150 people attended, demanding to know what was wrong with the students. source – Daily Mail UK"

“Let’s stand up and defend our rights!” say Italian filmmakers Antonio and Rosario Marciano.

The Marcianos, of the Italian website Tanker Enemy (Tanker-Enemy.eu) have produced the documentary film, Chemtrails: the secret war (below) to show scientific evidence related to the chemtrails phenomenon. While much of the documentation has been presented in previous years by Professor Michel Chossudovsky, head of Global Research, no film captures the covert war against We the People as well as the Marcianos do.

“Weather manipulation is only one (collateral) aspect of this phenomenon,” say the Marcianos. “What is at stake is a covert military agenda.”

This HD documentary film is the first Italian professional film on illegal geo-engineering aka chemtrails.

“It has been realized thanks to many friends and collaborators. For years this issue has been denied and mocked but the chemical spraying of our sky is still happening,” the couple say.

In September 2014, Jacques Daidié, a French activist, went to Italy where he met the Marcianos, well-known Italian activists against geo-engineering. The French translation was born from that meeting and then, produced by several members of the French association “Ciel voilé”, (www.cielvoile.fr).

Other contributors of the film’s translation include Jacques, Dominique from Avignon, Mary from Monteux, Sebastien from St Firmin in Valgaudemard and Danielle from Gap.

In 2012, Dupre reported in the article, Geoengineered climate change heats up debate:

“The US Air Force has the capability of manipulating climate either for testing purposes or for outright military-intelligence use,” economist Chossudovsky wrote. “These capabilities extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes. In recent years, large amounts of money have been allocated by the US Department of Defense to further developing and perfecting these capabilities.

“Ironically,” Chossudovsky remarked, “the Pentagon, while recognizing its ability to modify the World’s climate for military use, has joined the global warming consensus. (This disguises the Pentagon’s perfidy.) In a major study (pdf), the Pentagon has analyzed in detail the implications of various global warming scenarios.

Weather-modification, according to US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report, ‘offers the war fighter a wide range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary’ and, it says, extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes:

“Weather modification will become a part of domestic and international security and could be done unilaterally… It could have offensive and defensive applications and even be used for deterrence purposes. The ability to generate precipitation, fog, and storms on earth or to modify space weather, … and the production of artificial weather all are a part of an integrated set of technologies which can provide substantial increase in US, or degraded capability in an adversary, to achieve global awareness, reach, and power. (US Air Force, emphasis added. Air University of the US Air Force, AF 2025 Final Report, www.au.af.mil emphasis added)”

Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama provides the full spectrum of Air Force education, from pre-commissioning to the highest levels of professional military education, including degree granting and professional continuing education for officers, enlisted and civilian personnel throughout their careers. AU’s PME programs educate Airmen on the capabilities of air and space power and its role in national security. AU conducts research in air, space and cyberspace power, education, leadership and management. AU also provides citizenship programs and contributes to the development and testing of Air Force doctrine, concepts and strategy.

“The significant expansion in America’s weather warfare arsenal, which is a priority of the Department of Defense is not a matter for debate or discussion,” stated Chossudovsky in 2004, calling the subject matter“a scientific taboo.”

This taboo constitutes a human rights violation as much as fossil fuel companies and other polluters dismissing climate change today. The Marcianos hope their new movie, Chemtrails, the secret war, will catapult chemtrail deniers out of their comfort zone and into reality, at least for more open public debate if not action against the covert war."

Oil sold off nearly 4 bucks a barrel, the Dow was off nearly 270 points, bonds tumbled and gold plunged nearly $50 per ounce. The dollar was bought because the euro sold off due to debt trouble in Southern Europe. There are fears of a debt default in Portugal, Italy, Spain and Greece. The “safe haven” of the U.S. dollar is the beneficiary of those consternations.

The odd thing is, the job market in the U.S is showing signs of more trouble. That was an additional weight on the stock market because out of work people do not spend money. Word is, there is going to be a very large revision to the jobs data to the downside. I have been saying for months there were bigger job losses than reported by the government. For example, a month ago, I did a post called “Unemployment 5 Times Worse than BLS Reports.” Now, Bureau of Labor Statistics is making a huge revision to the unemployment number. This should not be a surprise to regular readers of USAWatchdog.

The BLS says 1, 360,000 more jobs were lost in the last year (or revision period) than was originally reported. That means the recession job losses were 19% worse that what the government has been reporting. 8.4 million jobs have now been officially lost in this recession! Instead of concentrating on this giant revision, the mainstream media reported only the monthly unemployment number which unexpectedly shrank to 9.7% from 10%. The reason it shrank, according to economist John Williams of shadowstats.com, is an accounting gimmick called “seasonal-adjustment.” The “seasonal-adjustment” was made because there were not as many post-holiday layoffs. Williams says, “I think companies didn’t layoff as many as usual because they did not hire as many to start with.” Williams is predicting “serious jobs and unemployment deterioration in the months ahead.” By the way, if there was no “seasonal-adjustment,” the official government unemployment number would have jumped to 10.6%. If unemployment was computed the way BLS did it prior to 1994, it would be 21.2% according to shadowstats.com.

Spiraling unemployment is very dollar negative. For one thing, it is revealing a much weaker economy than what is being reported in the mainstream media. It will also light a fire under Congress to spend more money to “fix” the problem. There is a $150 billion “jobs” bill going through the Senate, and it will probably pass soon. That will certainly not be the end of the money spending. Almost every state in the union is facing some sort of budget shortfall. California alone is $20 billion in the hole right now! A bailout of every state in need will cost between $100 billion and $200 billion this year alone. What do you think the chances of a bailout for financially troubled states are in an election year? All this spending adds to an already record deficit, with no end in sight.

Wild spending, record deficits and bailouts are just a few of the reasons not to be bullish on the buck. There was an excellent article in Market Watch earlier this week that named 20 triggers that could set off the debt bomb that will blow away your financial future. Please read this story called “20 Reasons Global Debt Time Bomb Explodes Soon.”

All this news of debt, default and deficits are dollar negative and gold positive. Financial expert Dan Norcini gives some of the very best commentary and market analysis in the business. He summed up yesterday’s market sell off this way, “Nothing really has changed except that gold is getting sold off from a higher level which means it will also find support at a higher level as it continues its steady climb higher.” (Click here for Norcini’s complete commentary)

Meanwhile, I want to bring your attention to a clip that first aired on CNBC Asia in November. The CEO of Nine Points Capital, Damon Vickers, says the dollar will be “utterly destroyed,” and big changes are coming to America and the world because of the dollar’s demise. Vickers heads up a very successful hedge fund with serious money to invest, so you should listen closely."

Failed presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren blurred out the word 'Chinese' from President Donald Trump’s tweeting in which he called coronavirus the 'Chinese Virus.'

Trump tweeted on Wednesday, he “only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst-case scenario in the future.”

“President Trump, are your eyes stitched shut? Hospitals need test kits, ventilators, & other medical supplies.""

""That's why the DPA exists. Stop dragging your feet & burying your head & start helping hospitals that are about to be slammed by this pandemic.”

But rather than retweeting Trump’s comment, the Massachusetts Democrat instead shared a screenshot of the president's message with the word “Chinese” blurred out.

Trump insisted, calling the coronavirus the 'Chinese virus' is “not racist at all.”

“It comes from China; that's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

Hillary Clinton also accused Trump of employing “racist rhetoric” for using the term “Chinese virus.”

“The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis.""

“Don’t fall for it. Don’t let your friends and family fall for it.”

Trump said his decision to use the term 'Chinese virus' was prompted after a spokesman for communist China’s Foreign Ministry, said the coronavirus 'might' have been brought to China by members of the U.S military.

The baseless claims made by Zhao Lijian seemed to be part of a propaganda campaign to flip the blame against the United States.

“When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!”

Lijian also posted links to other propaganda that also falsely claimed that the coronavirus originated in the U.S."

It also mentions the potential punishment of critics and adversaries as enemies of the state.",True,"The article connects events and observations, such as the false characterization of the coronavirus, the partnership between NGOs and military organizations, the push for biometric verification, and the similarities to China's social credit system, to support the conspiracy theory.",True,The article implies secrecy by suggesting that the true intentions behind the actions of the actors involved are hidden and that the implementation of the surveillance and control measures is being done under the cover of a pandemic.,"Total surveillance requires 24/7 monitoring of political enemies of the state.

Now that the state and its media have falsely characterized the coronavirus as a pandemic closing in on the 1918 flu pandemic (falsely attributed to Spain), it is time for the global elite and their technocrats to force not only highly-profitable (for Big Pharma) vaccines on the world but biometric IDs as well.

“As countries begin to lift coronavirus lockdowns, biometric identification can help verify those who have already had the infection, and ensure that the vulnerable get the vaccine when it is launched, health and technology experts said,” reports Reuters.

A biometric ID system can keep a record of [the infected] and those getting the vaccine, said Larry Dohrs, Southeast Asia head at iRespond, a Seattle-based nonprofit that launched its technology last month.

The pretense for this — as it was for the US decimation of Libya, Syria, and Iraq — is “humanitarianism,” according to iRespond and Simprints, a British NGO partnered with Johns Hopkins University’s Global mHealth Initiative, the latter connected to the US military and its “Dark Winter” and “Event 201” pandemic scenarios (see Whitney Webb: All Roads Lead to Dark Winter).

Total surveillance requires 24/7 monitoring of individuals — especially those included in the Main Core database of activists and political enemies of the state — and biometric technology introduced during the hysteria of an exaggerated health threat fits the bill.

ID2020 — a project initiated by the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Gates and Microsoft, transnational pharmaceutical corporations, and technology firms — is pushing the concept that every human on the planet needs biometric verification because “to prove who you are is a fundamental and universal human right,” according to the ID2020 website.

“What they really want is a fully standardized data collection and retrieval format, and cross-border sharing of identities of the entire population of the planet, in order for the stand-alone AI-powered command center to work without a hitch, and for purposes of calculating everyone’s potential contribution, and threat to the system,” explains OffGrid Healthcare.

If you believe this is dangerously close to China’s “social credit” system, you’re not far off the mark.

Introducing this totalitarian technology under the cover of a supposed pandemic rife with speculation and a dearth of hard numbers is a near-perfect cover for “patient ID technology” producing data on individuals shared with the state and its corporate partners.

A vaccine ostensibly designed to combat COVID-19 will become mandatory and those who resist will be blacklisted as public health criminals. They will be locked out of society, similar to Chinese citizens suffering under China’s totalitarian social credit system.

Martin Armstrong believes the healthcare-industrial complex and the state will surreptitiously introduce a nanotech ID and tracking chip along with a cocktail of vaccine toxins, or they will sell it to the public as a way to identify those presumably infected.

“The proposal is a digital certificate that verifies if you have been vaccinated and was developed by MIT and Microsoft. They are looking at merging this with Bill Gates’ ID2020. It is entirely possible that this scare has been a deliberate plot to get people to accept these digital implants.

“Refuse, and you will be prohibited from social gatherings. Like 9/11 conditioned us to be x-rayed before entering a plane, now the next stage is to embed digital markers that they have been using in dogs and cats.”

COVID-19 is the perfect Trojan horse for a control freak state itching to not only micromanage the lives of ordinary citizens but also ferret out critics and potential adversaries and punish them as enemies of the state. The latter is the primary objective.

History is replete with examples — from Stalin and Mao to Hitler and Mussolini, with lesser autocrats and dictators along the way."

The Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates down to near-zero as the US economy absorbs a massive blow following the coronavirus pandemic, though stock futures plummeted despite the stimulus.

In a statement, the US central bank said: “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries … The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.”

Among a suite of programmes to combat the economic fallout from the global threat of the Covid-19 virus, the Fed will slash interest rates and increase its holdings of US Treasury securities by at least $500bn in addition to an increase of government mortgage-backed securities by another $200bn, in the hopes of lowering the costs of longer-term debts and bolstering the struggling housing market.

That dramatic $700bn snap mirrors the Fed’s quantitative easing actions amid the financial crisis in 2008.

Despite the boost, stock market futures on Sunday night hit “limit down” levels of 5 per cent or lower, with Dow Jones average futures off by more than 1,000 points.

In a statement announcing the rate drop from one full percentage point to .25 per cent, the central bank said: “The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. … The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. This action will help support economic activity, strong labour market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 per cent objective.”"

In September 2014, Jacques Daidié, a French activist, went to Italy where he met the Marcianos, well-known Italian activists against geo-engineering. The French translation was born from that meeting and then, produced by several members of the French association “Ciel voilé”, (www.cielvoile.fr).

Other contributors of the film’s translation include Jacques, Dominique from Avignon, Mary from Monteux, Sebastien from St Firmin in Valgaudemard and Danielle from Gap.

In 2012, Dupre reported in the article, Geoengineered climate change heats up debate:

“The US Air Force has the capability of manipulating climate either for testing purposes or for outright military-intelligence use,” economist Chossudovsky wrote. “These capabilities extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes. In recent years, large amounts of money have been allocated by the US Department of Defense to further developing and perfecting these capabilities.

“Ironically,” Chossudovsky remarked, “the Pentagon, while recognizing its ability to modify the World’s climate for military use, has joined the global warming consensus. (This disguises the Pentagon’s perfidy.) In a major study, the Pentagon has analyzed in detail the implications of various global warming scenarios.

Weather-modification, according to US Air Force document AF 2025 Final Report, ‘offers the war fighter a wide range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary’ and, it says, extend to the triggering of floods, hurricanes, droughts and earthquakes:

“Weather modification will become a part of domestic and international security and could be done unilaterally… It could have offensive and defensive applications and even be used for deterrence purposes. The ability to generate precipitation, fog, and storms on earth or to modify space weather, … and the production of artificial weather all are a part of an integrated set of technologies which can provide substantial increase in US, or degraded capability in an adversary, to achieve global awareness, reach, and power.

Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama provides the full spectrum of Air Force education, from pre-commissioning to the highest levels of professional military education, including degree granting and professional continuing education for officers, enlisted and civilian personnel throughout their careers. AU’s PME programs educate Airmen on the capabilities of air and space power and its role in national security. AU conducts research in air, space and cyberspace power, education, leadership and management. AU also provides citizenship programs and contributes to the development and testing of Air Force doctrine, concepts and strategy.

“The significant expansion in America’s weather warfare arsenal, which is a priority of the Department of Defense is not a matter for debate or discussion,” stated Chossudovsky in 2004, calling the subject matter“a scientific taboo.”

This taboo constitutes a human rights violation as much as fossil fuel companies and other polluters dismissing climate change today. The Marcianos hope their new movie, Chemtrails, the secret war, will catapult chemtrail deniers out of their comfort zone and into reality, at least for more open public debate if not action against the covert war."

Tyranny can come in many forms; whether it’s government overreach, propaganda pushed by the mainstream media, lies from corporate behemoths or corrupt government agencies, there is a war on freedom going on that simply cannot be ignored. Though tyranny is defined as an oppressive government or rule, the truth is that there are many players in this game: Government bodies, toxic industry leaders and the legacy media are tied together in all kinds of ways — and these days, it makes the truth scarcer than hen’s teeth. But what if you could get the real scoop on what’s actually going on in the world, no strings attached? That’s what the independent media is for.

Though left-wing tech giants like Google and Facebook are trying to quash free speech and independent thought, there are still alternatives to be had.

As part of the independent media, Tyranny.news brings you coverage on all things government tyranny and overreach, lies propagated by the legacy media, social media censorship deception piloted by big business and the latest scams being peddled by federal administrative agencies. With Tyranny.news, you can get all the information you need to stay informed on the latest threats to freedom in one place.

While the left-wing media may call it a “conspiracy theory,” the problem of tyrannical figures in places of power is quickly reaching its apex. Look no further than the massive censorship efforts underway at Facebook for proof of that: As a social media platform, Facebook’s ability to influence the thoughts, feelings and opinions of its users simply cannot be overstated.

With sweeping censorship of “dissident” thought on a wide array of topics, Facebook is paving the way to blatantly shut down open conversation on the internet. Combined with Google’s blatant censoring of content as well, and the average internet user is only able to see what the “powers that be” want them to see. Shockingly few people are aware of the fact that they, their thoughts and their opinions are being manipulated in this manner.

Censorship is one of the first steps toward total tyranny: When you censor what people see, you control what they know. And when you control what they know, you can start to control what they think. It all goes down hill from there — and that’s why staying informed and armed with the knowledge of reality is so important.

One of the most shocking acts of censorship by Facebook? Banning the Declaration of Independence. As Mike Adams, author of Food Forensics and director of CWC Labs, reports,” In the latest wake-up call that Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter censorship is completely out of control, Facebook recently banned a post that shared a section of the Declaration of Independence.”

Under the ban, Facebook labeled the section of the historic document “hate speech.”Adams continued by noting that while profoundly disturbing, it is sadly not surprising that Facebook and other tech giants oppose pro-liberty content.

Freedom under attack from every angle

While the problem of censorship is no doubt a big one, freedom is truly under attack from every angle. Whether its prohibiting families from growing their own food, or forcing vaccines via government mandate, liberty could be next thing to go extinct here in the U.S.

Recently, it was revealed that a Californian doctor has come under fire for writing a vaccine exemption for a child who had suffered a major adverse event following a previous inoculation in 2015 — the reaction was so bad, the child even lost urinary function. Dr. Sears, a respected doctor, has truly had the book thrown at him by the CA attorney general. According to the AG, Dr. Sears failed to obtain “basic information needed for decision making” before writing an exemption.

Dr. Sears made a request for this “basic information” an entire year before writing the exemption. How long are parents and children supposed to wait, and how much harm was this child supposed to endure before being given a waiver? This is medical tyranny at its finest. A doctor can’t even act in a child’s best interests without the state’s permission (or in this case, interference).

MintCast is an interview podcast featuring dissenting voices, independent researchers and journalists the establishment would rather silence.

In this episode, we are joined by independent journalist Whitney Webb. Many of our readers and listeners are familiar with Webb from her extraordinary work at MintPress as a staff writer and investigative reporter. She is now a contributor and is working on her first book about Jeffery Epstein and his ties to the Deep State.

Webb recently published a series of reports on the Last American Vagabond entitled “Engineering Contagion: Amerithrax, Coronavirus and the Rise of the Biotech-Industrial Complex.” In them, she exposes the agendas of the national security state, Silicon Valley tech giants, billionaires, Big Pharma, the U.S. government’s years-long preparation for a flu-like pandemic similar to COVID-19 and how they planned to capitalize on that crisis to fulfill a vision worthy of George Orwell’s “1984.”

While the American public is riddled with panic and fear over the spread of the coronavirus, a mass surveillance system far worse than that introduced to the nation after 9/11 is being built under the guise of protecting public health — all with public consent. The effort to normalize this plan for the greater good will expand a surveillance system that will make authoritarianism the new normal and further reduce American civil liberties.

From Jared Kushner to Bill Gates to the corruption-riddled vaccine companies tied to the opioid epidemic to Silicon Valley tech giants and their role in martial law, rolling back civil liberties and authoritarianism — Whitney Webb unpacks the many conflicts of interests at play in the government and corporate response to COVID-19. She also discusses how the search for a cure ties into a larger agenda to use public fear over the pandemic to build a techno-tyrannical state worthy of George Orwell’s “1984.”

Rouhani vowed to identify the culprits and refer them to judicial authorities in addition to arranging compensation payments to the victims’ families.

The video shows four people wearing nurse uniforms carrying a fifth individual in a plastic bag, with COVID 19 written on the feet.

The clip is a reference to the popular dancing Ghanaian pallbearers meme, which is based on a real company in Ghana that carries coffins while dancing.

Many social media users reacted with anger over the clip.

Despite the criticism, some users defend the medics, saying that the video is actually showing the nurses defeating the disease.

“They are carrying Covid19’s dead body… because they just beat it,” pondered Roman Yoder. “To the sound of the funeral meme that has been going around."
930,True,The article suggests that there is a hidden agenda behind Canada's actions and that NATO and its allies are intentionally supporting terrorism.,True,"The article mentions Canada, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and Russia as actors involved in the conspiracy.",True,The article states that Canada sells military equipment to Saudi Arabia and supports the US strategy to use terrorists to destroy Syria.,True,The article suggests that the actions of Canada and NATO contribute to the spread of terrorism and pose a threat to Syria.,True,The article connects events and actions of various actors to support the conspiracy theory.,True,The article implies that there is secrecy and hidden intentions behind the actions of Canada and NATO.,"Canada is currently branding itself in terms of humanitarianism, and the concrete gesture of accepting Syrian refugees – families, women, children, as well as gay men and women, are prioritized -- is laudable, and no doubt a godsend to those seeking refuge from the foreign mercenary terrorists who are invading Syria.

But the photo-ops also serve to obfuscate the correct diagnosis and cure for the disease afflicting Syria.

When Canada sells military equipment to Saudi Arabia, Canada is part of the disease. More importantly, Canada contributes to the cause of the disease metastasizing overseas when it chooses to ally itself with the cancer rather than the cure.

The cancer is NATO and its allies, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan. We are the countries funding the terrorists, and we are the cancer that purportedly wants to illegally impose regime change in Syria. Canada's newly-minted Minister of National Defence, Harjit Sajjan -- amidst unproven allegations about President al-Assad’s “brutality”--- asserted, after all, that “President Assad, he does need to go”.

Decoded, this means that Canada supports the U.S strategy, as outlined by a 2012 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) document, to use criminal terrorists --- most recently branded as ISIS --- to destroy the sovereign country of Syria and topple its legal government, headed by President Bashar al-Assad.

Canada, in association with NATO and its allies, wants to make Syria safe for terrorists, and some form of theocracy, consistent with the on-going NATO strategy of using fanatical terrorists to destroy Iraq, Libya, and Ukraine.

Iraq is still infested with Western-allied terrorists – where there were none before that illegal invasion. Libya is now infested with terrorists – the same ones supported by NATO during its illegal regime-change operation; and Ukraine is infested with neo-Nazi associated terrorists elements of which were suppressed prior to NATO meddling.

Unlike Western “interventions” in Syria, Russia’s intervention conforms to the the rule of international law: President Assad solicited Russia’s military assistance into Syria, and the UN Security Council approved it. So, while Russia is making Syria safe for Syrians, the West is doing the opposite.

Russia’s military assistance, if successful, will cure the terror disease in Syria, and therefore solve the refugee problem by making Syria safe for everyone, including families, women, children, and homosexuals.

If the direct causes of terrorism are not identified and addressed, the flood of refugees will continue, and more countries will be impacted by Terror Inc.

On the one hand, NATO countries are enabling and supporting terrorism, while on the other, they are saving face, and hiding their criminality, by accepting refugees. From a public relations point of view, it works. But if NATO’s intentions were humanitarian, it would stop supporting the terrorists.

It shouldn’t be complicated. There wouldn’t be refugees if the disease was correctly diagnosed and treated. Band-Aid solutions are easing the pain, but they are not the cure."
931,True,The article suggests that there is a cycle of empires falling and that the political and financial systems are becoming corrupt.

There is a lifespan of an empire . . . at the top of every empire . . . there is an issue of the financial system, and there is an issue with the political system that becomes absolutely corrupt. This is why this announcement (FBI not indicting Clinton) came. Again, this is political corruption. It’s not just here in the United States, but globally it is flashing red across the sky. . . . I think they are well aware that the whole system is going down. The collapse of empires is upon us. . . . We are in an environment that globally we have never seen before. With what we are seeing in the United States with the corruption in politics, we’ve seen that before. Every great empire, right at the top, the two key elements that appear are financial system on the edge and political corruption trying to patch it all together. That is something we see over and over again throughout history.”

So, what’s new? Mannarino contends, “We are in uncharted territory. It’s occurring right under everybody’s nose. Barely anyone is aware of what is going on because it’s not getting any media coverage. There is this phenomenon where trillions of dollars of currency are being moved or rushing towards the debt market that is squeezing bond yields to historic lows. We are making history in the United States for the second week in a row, and I am talking about the bond market. Last week, we hit an historic low with regard to yield. People are so desperate, people are so desperate they are willing to accept negative returns. This is how desperate they are. . . . This is, and I can’t stress this enough, this is the biggest red flag I can possibly imagine. We are on the cusp of some event that is going to change the landscape of the world.”

On the banking system, Mannarino says, “The system is completely illiquid. . . . The total amount of cash (according to the Federal Reserve) that is printed, that you can hold in your hand that is in circulation around the world, is $1.4 trillion. The rest of it is just credit and debt ($19 trillion current national debt). If you want to talk about unfunded liabilities, you are talking more than $100 trillion. So, how can this ever be paid back? We have $1.4 trillion in actual cash. That is all that exits on the earth. How can $1.4 trillion in actual cash ever pay back this debt? Let me put this another way. The commercial banks say they have $11 trillion in deposits. How can they have $11 trillion in deposits when there only exits $1.4 trillion? It is a liquidity problem. The banks are insolvent. They are absolutely insolvent. They do not have the cash. You can understand where this is going, and this is a global phenomenon that we have never seen before. Cash moving into the debt market like this is unprecedented, and it is getting no media coverage.”

The other warning sign that something is very wrong can be seen in the price of gold and silver. Mannarino says, “Both gold and silver, since the beginning of this year, have taken off like rockets, and they are not going to stop. This environment is on the edge. . . . These are monetary metals. People refer to them as precious metals. They are real money, and they have been real money for thousands of years. No central banker is going to make it different just by saying they are not money. The system is illiquid, and the banks are insolvent.”

The real cost will be in lives lost. Mannarino contends, “We have seen debt rise in tandem with human population. We understand the debt is not sustainable, and we understand the world central banks are going through very desperate measures to try to keep that debt bubble sustained. The debt bubble is the greatest threat to humankind—bar none. It is greater than a nuclear exchange. There is going to be a point when we cannot borrow anymore from the future. When that happens, the debt bubble pops, and we get a correction in human population. Millions and millions of people are going to die.”

He noted that the ISIS is in a very bad financial shape as the terrorist group has to pay salaries of its militants, and buy weapons and ammunition in order to fight the government forces in Syria.

""The ISIS commanders in Syria have come to know that their financial resources are quickly coming to an end and the relentless attacks by the Syrian army and Russian air force as well as the Turkish army's attacks on their military positions will soon result in cutting all their logistical and supply routes,"" Badreddin added.

He reiterated that the ISIS has announced that it will execute those militants who flee the battlefields and this has resulted in the discontent of the terrorists.

""The ISIS's five envoys are commissioned to meet the terrorist group's supporters in Egypt's Sina region and receive financial aid from them,"" Badreddin said.

The ISIS has also been promised to receive more new recruits for war in Syria and Libya because the terrorist group has lost many of its militants over the past three months.

The ISIS commanders have written several letters to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and demanded urgent logistical help from him, but the aids have been delayed due to the intensified attacks by the Syrian army on ISIS's military positions in Mosul and Fallujah in recent months.

In early June, military sources said that the Syrian Army troops and popular forces' rapid advances and their race towards the ISIS-held city of Raqqa from different directions testify that the ISIS is on the verge of a complete fall in Syria.

""The ISIS now faces a serious threat to its capital, Raqqa city,"" the sources said, adding, ""However, the more immediate objective seems to be the capture of al-Tabaqa Airbase or a push Northwards to the Euphrates River; the latter move would have all ISIS-held areas in the Aleppo province cut off from the ISIS mainland.""

""In the past week, about 100 ISIS fighters have been killed in Western Raqqa while government forces have advanced 45 kilometers along the Ithriya-Raqqa road,"" the sources added.

""With the ISIS capital under increasing pressure, the group's commanders are forced to prioritize their scarce manpower between the Manbij frontline and the Western Raqqa frontline,"" they went on to say."
933,False,The article does not suggest a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions Shane Morgan as the person who received the flu shot and experienced negative health effects.,True,"The article describes Shane Morgan receiving the flu shot and subsequently experiencing paralysis, loss of vision, and difficulty walking.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,False,The article does not mention any patterns.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"A Las Vegas man became partially paralyzed, lost his vision and the ability to walk just one day after receiving the flu shot.

Every year, we here at NTEB do our best to warn you about the dangers of getting a flu shot. And every year, some dear sweet reader, who works as a nurse in a hospital somewhere, will write in and chide us for discouraging people from getting their shot.

Shane Morgan was one of those people who thought the benefits of the flu shot outweighed the risks involved, so back in November he obeyed the ubiquitous bully marketing from Big Pharma, and went and got his shot. Got shot is more like it. Within 36 hours he went blind, struggled to breath and became partially paralyzed. He spent 4 days on a ventilator in the ICU of his hospital.

But it hasn’t been all bad news, though. Shane didn’t catch the flu.

FROM NBC 3 LAS VEGAS: Shane Morgan went from perfectly healthy to unable to speak, walk, or breathe on his own. He’s been hospitalized for the last 2 weeks. At one point he was even put on a ventilator and in the ICU and his family blames the flu shot.

At the start of November, Shane and his wife Monique like most couples were planning for the holidays, and with family and young infants coming to town they decided to get the flu shot.

“About 36-hours after he got the flu shot he started to get sick,” Monique said as she sat next to her husband in his hospital bed. Shane started complaining that he couldn’t feel his legs or arms so his wife rushed him to Centennial Hills Hospital, where he spent 4-days on a ventilator in the ICU.

Doctors started treating Shane for Guillain-Barre Syndrome also known as GBS. It’s a rare disorder where a person’s immune system damages their nerve cells, in some cases turning deadly.

According to the CDC, there is a link between the flu shot and GBS, but it’s extremely rare. Statistics show 1 to 2 people develop GBS from the flu shot per 1-million vaccinations.

Officials with the Southern Nevada Health District say the risk of developing GBS is actually higher if you catch the flu.

“The benefit from the flu vaccine greatly overcomes any specific rare condition like this one that might happen,” said Fermin Leguen, Chief Medical Officer with the Health District.

However, for the Morgans it’s just not worth the risk. “He’d take the flu ten to one,” Monique said.

Interrupted by Shane who said, “I’d take the flu shot three times a season than to have to do this once in a lifetime.” They say no one in their family will get the flu shot ever again.

The health district says this story shouldn’t deter people from getting the flu shot, they say it saves lives. The Morgan’s have a long road ahead of them, they’ve set up a GoFundMe account to help with their expenses. READ MORE

But, everyone should agree on this point:

No government can force anyone who has reached legal adulthood to be vaccinated for the coronavirus [we are protected by the Nuremberg Code].

Equally, no government can vaccinate minors for the coronavirus against the will of their parents or guardians.

Please SIGN this urgent petition which urges policymakers at every level of government to reject calls for mandatory coronavirus vaccination.

Fear of a disease – which we know very little about, relative to other similar diseases – must not lead to knee-jerk reactions regarding public health, nor can it justify supporting the hidden agenda of governmental as well as non-governmental bodies that have apparent conflicts of interest in plans to restrict personal freedoms.

The so-called “public health experts” have gotten it wrong many times during the current crisis. We should not, therefore, allow their opinions to rush decision-makers into policies regarding vaccination.

And, while some people, like Bill Gates, may have a lot of money, his opinion and that of his NGO (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) – namely, that life will not return to normal till people are widely vaccinated – should not be permitted to influence policy decisions on a coronavirus vaccination program.

Finally, we must also not allow the rush by pharmaceutical companies to produce a new coronavirus vaccine to, itself, become an imperative for vaccination.

Unwitting citizens must not be used as guinea pigs for New World Order ideologues, or Big Pharma, in pursuit of a vaccine (and, profits) which may not even protect against future mutated strains of the coronavirus.

And it goes without saying that the production of vaccines using aborted babies for cell replication is a total non-starter, as the technique is gravely immoral.

However, if after sufficient study of the issue, a person who has reached the age of majority wishes to be vaccinated with a morally produced vaccine, along with his children, that is his business.

But we cannot and will not permit the government to make that decision for us.

Thank you for SIGNING and SHARING this petition, urging policymakers at all levels of government to reject mandatory coronavirus vaccination.

Please follow THIS LINK and SIGN the petition."

The West’s on-going impunity as it continues to perpetrate genocide in Iraq should alert us to the dangers of repeated offenses elsewhere. Preliminary reports, for example, indicate that NATO is targeting water infrastructure as it illegally bombs Syria.

The illegal invasions of Iraq and Libya were sold to us through lies and deceptions. And yet we remain seemingly immune to reasonable, well-documented information that the war on Syria is also being perpetrated by means of lies and deception.

Strategies of deception are being perpetrated by warmongering imperialists in all of these wars, yet despite the on-going holocaust, and the real threat of nuclear war, the same genocidal strategies are being successfully employed again. And the public remains remarkably oblivious to what is happening.

What are these strategies, and how can we counter them?

A “soft power complex” engineers domestic hatred towards perennially re-branded enemies, and consent for permanent, illegal warfare, beneath false banners of “democracy”, “freedom”, or “humanitarian intervention”. It also engineers murderous chaos and destabilization in target countries. Sometimes there are unforeseen consequences, but none of the strategies are mistakes, as apologists would have us believe.

Sources of the globalized deception are “Non-Governmental Agencies” (NGOs) -- such as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), -- as well as oligarch–funded foundations, Public Relations (PR) companies, think tanks, and intelligence agencies.

Mainstream media (MSM) often uses PR-engineered sources for its stories – the “White Helmets” in Syria would be a good example – and it often tells its stories using commentators who have largely undisclosed links to the Military Industrial Complex (MIC). For example, an October, 2013 analysis by the public accountability initiative, titled, “Conflicts of interest in the Syria debate|An analysis of the defense industry ties of experts and think tanks who commented on military intervention”, discloses widespread conflicts of interest involving 22 media commentators who offered ostensibly “objective” commentaries about a previously planned, illegal (future) invasion:

Not only are MSM stories rife with undisclosed prejudices and conflicts of interest, as listed above, but some transformative stories themselves are likely dramatic presentations masquerading as reality. And it’s all legal.

According to an amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the House Bill H.R 5736 (now law), the federal government of the United States can now legally propagandize the domestic public.

Arguably, this makes staged theatrical presentations, featuring crisis-actors, and purporting to be “reality”, legal.

Consequently, not only are we contending with false media source information, corporate media gatekeepers, and commentators with largely undisclosed conflicts of interest, but now we must also contend with fabricated dramas orchestrated to invoke primordial fears and unthinking reactions in mass populations. It’s a closed loop circuit of lies, deceptions, and behaviour modification writ large. Recent evidence demonstrates, moreover, that the matrix of deceptions works brilliantly to engineer consent for the most heinous crimes imaginable.

Democracy demands an informed population, yet governing agencies are working overtime to ensure that their “audience” remains deluded. The degenerate “controllers” are winning. The dystopian future envisioned by Orwell has arrived."

If it stops (injecting money into the repo market by billions of dollars daily), interest rates will rise.”

Armstrong goes on to explain, “The Bank of Japan came out and said we’re going to buy government bonds unlimited. They, too, are trying to prevent interest rates from rising. . . . The ECB cannot afford rates to go up. . . . This is a global contagion that’s developing, and it’s pretty serious. The rise in interest rates has tremendous implications all the way around the globe. . . . Interest rates are rising because there is increased risk – period.”

The big risk, according to Armstrong, is global governments, including the U.S. Armstrong says, “You have to understand, at some point in time, capital begins to figure out who is the greatest risk, and the risk is government. At that stage in the game, when that point is reached, then you have shifts. The capital will move from public types of investments, such as government bonds and things of that nature, and then will move into the private sector. That’s equities, and that can be gold and real estate in different places. You try to go to tangible assets.”

So, what could go wrong with the Fed trapped in the repo market and cannot stop liquefying bad debt? Armstrong says, “What can go wrong is that they lose the game. They are doing this to try to prevent interest rates from rising. If they did not do this, the short term rate would be up dramatically.”

What could go wrong is the Fed can continue to fuel the repo market with cheap money and interest rates can rise anyway? Armstrong says, “Correct. They have already lost control, otherwise they wouldn’t be doing this. . . .They are trying to keep rates down. If the Fed loses, rates are going to go up, and you are going to see this in the Treasury auctions. Then it won’t matter what the Fed is trying to do in the repo market. You will see this stress in the Treasury auctions, and the government will have to start paying higher prices. This is what’s going to take place.”

In closing, Armstrong says, “The central banks are losing power. That’s what my new book “Manipulating the World Economy” is all about. It’s about all the manipulations. Governments have tried to control it, and they are losing it on every possible level. This is like the last ditch effort, the last hurrah or last battle for the central banks. If the Fed loses, you are talking about central banks can no longer function in controlling the economy, inflation or anything.”

New documents released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in response to a lawsuit filed by the families of 9/11 victims have revealed bombshell information linking Saudi Arabia to the terrorist attacks.

In what these families are saying is a key victory for their cause, the FBI apparently failed to redact the name of a key Saudi official, which inadvertently exposed one of the federal government’s most sensitive secrets pertaining to the events of September 11, 2001.

This “giant screw-up,” as the agency is calling it, revealed “a mysterious Saudi Embassy official in Washington who agents suspected had directed crucial support of two of the al-Qaida hijackers,” a Yahoo News exclusive explains.

The alleged mistake occurred after Attorney General William Barr and acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell had sought information about Saudi Arabia’s role in the attacks, which had previously been banned from public access due to its designation as “state secrets.”

The individual in question is named Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah, and he was an official diplomat with the Saudi foreign ministry and embassy in Washington, D.C., and oversaw Ministry of Islamic Affairs employees at various Saudi-funded mosques and Islamic centers throughout the United States between 1999 and 2000.

This Jarrah character is said to have been a key “link” between the Saudi government and a Los Angeles al-Qaeda terror cell that produced some of the 9/11 hijackers. As it turns out, he also maintained continued direct contact with this terror group throughout his tenure at the Saudi embassy.

While the names of two other Saudi individuals who assisted two of the terrorists who hijacked the American Airlines plane that allegedly flew into the Pentagon, Jarrah’s identity as a third assistant has up until now been unknown.

The FBI has been trying to quash this whole investigation

For years, the families of the 9/11 victims pursuing this suit have had Jarrah on their radar because they suspected that he might have important information about the case. They have repeatedly tried to get information about him and a handful of others believed to be involved, but were not successful until now.

Based on what has now been revealed by this “accident,” the families have learned that Jarrah was, in fact, “responsible for the placement of Ministry of Islamic Affairs employees known as guides and propagators posted to the United States, including Fahad al-Thumairy.”

Thumairy is another Saudi agent who was reportedly “tasked” with assisting the hijackers prior to their hijacking. Along with a third individual, Omar al-Bayoumi, Thumairy helped to ensure that the attack occurred without a hitch.

“The FBI believed that al-Jarrah was ‘supporting’ and ‘maintaining’ al-Thumairy during the 9/11 investigation,” stated Catherine Hunt, a former FBI agent based in Los Angeles who has been assisting the families pursuing this case.

Speaking on behalf of the 9/11 families, Brett Eagleson also said that this revelation about Jarrah confirms the Saudi chain of command that pulled off 9/11, and that it all links back to the Saudi embassy in D.C. It is also important to keep in mind that Jarrah reported directly to Prince Bandar, who later became Saudi Arabia’s intelligence chief and the kingdom’s national security council head.

“It demonstrates there was a hierarchy of command that’s coming from the Saudi embassy to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs [in Los Angeles] to the hijackers,” Eagleson is quoted as saying.

While there is certainly much more evidence about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that is being kept under wraps by the government, this revelation represents yet another chip off the iceberg that will more than likely continue to unravel the official story for the world to see.

Former president has a bizarre message on impeachment

Former President Bill Clinton offered President Donald Trump advice on his approach to the ongoing impeachment inquiry, due to the fact he experienced similar when he was in office.

Clinton, who appeared on CNN, was asked what ""message"" he had for the president as the hearings began on his 'conduct' with Ukraine, which sparked the impeachment probe.

""My message would be, you got hired to do a job,"" Clinton responded.

""You don't get the days back you blow off. Every day is an opportunity to make something good happen.""

""I would say, 'I've got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry, and they should just have at it,"" he added.

""Meanwhile, I'm going to work for the American people.' That's what I would do.""

""At some point, you know, denial is no longer an option, and Congress is basically in denial of the consequences of doing nothing, or at least the people who were opposed to it.""

Trump, on Thursday, admitted that impeachment has taken on his family, revealing it has been “very, very hard.""

Speaking to the crowd at his rally in Louisiana, trump said:

“I have one problem. And it has been very hard on my family. Whoever heard — impeachment to me is a dirty word.""

""It’s been very unfair, very hard on my family.""

On Thursday, Socialist New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN that efforts to impeach Trump were about “preventing a potentially disastrous outcome” for the Democrats in the 2020 elections.

""We’re talking about the potential compromise of the 2020 elections. This is not just about something that has occurred, about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome next year,"" she said.

Comey outed himself as a leaker of privileged information when he released a personal memo to the New York Times that implied Trump tried to interfere with the investigation into alleged Russian ties to the Trump campaign. Comey admitted to leaking the memo in order to force a Special Prosecutor to be appointed. Did Comey break the law? Donald Trump’s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, was featured in a headline that said, “President Trump’s Lawyer: ‘Leaker’ Comey ‘Retaliatory’ in ‘Unauthorized Disclosures’ to Press of ‘Privileged Communications with the President.’ ” Also, as part of a very bad week for Comey, he is facing a new lawsuit that claims “FBI Illegally Spied on Government & Trump.”

Meanwhile, Comey claims he was fired because of the Russia investigation, but Comey repeatedly said that Trump was not the target of the investigation. Comey also repeatedly said that Trump did not obstruct the investigation. You can’t have it both ways. Comey can’t testify that there was no obstruction, and then leak information to get a Special Prosecutor appointed to look into obstruction. Now, even the mainstream “Destroy Trump” media is backing off. Chris Matthews says the so-called Russian/Trump collusion story “came apart” with the James Comey testimony. Comey should hire a criminal defense lawyer.

We have a record stock market once again at the same time the world has record debt. Most of the debt is simply unpayable. Maybe this is the reason why multi-billion dollar money manager Paul Singer is “very concerned.” Singer said on Bloomberg this week, “What we have today is a global financial system that’s just about as leveraged, and in many cases more leveraged, than before 2008.” You might remember that 2008 was the last time the financial markets had a major meltdown that required the Fed and every central bank in the world to come to the rescue with trillions of dollars in bailout money.

The cabinet Trump has built is an unorthodox, if not surprising one. Its members represent several of America’s most successful business ventures, perhaps none more so than former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. Tillerson is now secretary of state and fourth in the line of presidential succession.

To expect the level of polish we get from career politicians out of Tillerson and the rest of the Trump cabinet might be asking too much. It is reasonable, however, to expect that these men and women should serve their country honestly. Unfortunately, recent statements by Tillerson raise some questions about the secretary’s honesty. It’s a theme that’s becoming far too common inside the Trump White House.

One issue many Americans are concerned isn’t being handled appropriately by the Trump administration is climate change. After Barrack Obama’s administration made progress in the fight to preserve our earthly home for future generations, Trump’s seems determined to undo everything that was accomplished.

Tillerson has played a lead role in this effort, claiming that the global temperature record has been unchanged for the last decade. That’s a statement that flies in the face of established research by not one, but many esteemed figures within the scientific community.

Another fishy move by Tillerson took place when he spoke June 9th, 2017 about the developing situation in the middle east and Qatar. Tillerson broke from the decades-old convention of referring to the body of water between Saudi Arabia and Iran as the “Arabian Gulf”.

While the term isn’t completely undefined, “Persian Gulf” has been the recognized name for this waterway since the year 1917. While journalistic institutions might struggle with the term at times, Tillerson’s choice of wording in this case might not be a simple mistake.

Iran has long insisted on the use of “Persian Gulf,” a term that suggests the gulf falls under Iranian control. While the term flares tempers in the Arab world, Tillerson chose to use its alternative. Perhaps to slight Iran, or associate conflict in the region with Arab states.

You would have to be living under a rock at this point to have avoided all the times Trump and his team have been caught changing their story.

Trump himself took criticism for reversing his position on a Muslim ban during his campaign. He was skewered by the media after abruptly reversing his position on the importance of NATO and most recently has given a number of stories about the events leading up to the firing of former FBI director James Comey.

As many in the media have pointed out, endorsing a policy of dishonesty inside the White House is a toxic and dangerous move. The obvious consequence of which is that the United States’ credibility as a nation will be impacted.

Repeat offenses by others inside the Trump administration seem to indicate that this is exactly what’s going on. Press secretary Sean Spicer has come under so much pressure from the media the administration hardly even holds press conferences anymore.

Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway chose to distort facts so often during and after campaign season that it led to the creation of the now infamous phrase “alternative facts,” a term that surfaced following the conversation about Trump’s false inauguration attendance numbers.

Even Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ credibility has come under question following his hearing in front of the Senate intelligence committee. While Sessions was never caught in an outright lie, the committee repeatedly pointed to his unwillingness to answer direct questions. On multiple occasions, Sessions provided half-answers about meetings with Russian government officials.

Trump’s administration has done two things by making no attempt to hide their tactics of distorting the truth. They have traded the respect of foreign officials to look confident in the eyes of their base, and they have undermined a precedent about the way that American presidential administrations operate.

The first outcome is immediately detrimental. Whereas previous American presidents demanded respect and stood for the ideals of integrity and truth, Trump has been mocked and even scorned by dignitaries from Great Britain, France and Australia, all close partners of the US in the past.

If future presidential candidates don’t take steps to raise the proverbial standard of play, this rhetoric of insincerity could poison America’s political dialog for decades to come.

The fallacies that Rex Tillerson has tried to pass are in many ways less notable than those of his colleagues. Challenging climate science is nothing new, and his comments on the gulf may or may not have been pre-meditated.

Nevertheless, Tillerson is part of the new class. He didn’t play any role in building Trump’s political machine, and that makes it more frightening to see him adopting this tactic. No presidential cabinet is perfect, but what are the repercussions of one that’s perfectly corrupt?

In perhaps his most offensive remarks to date, far-left Canadian actor Jim Carrey has attacked Mitch McConnell, accusing the Republican Senate majority leader of being worse than Osama bin Laden.

In a Wednesday tweet, Carrey stated that bin Laden “doesn’t hold a candle to” McConnell while comparing gun crime in the US to the September 11, 2001, attacks.

Referring to the 9/11 attacks that killed about 3,000 people, Carrey posted that “what Osama Bin Laden did to us was terrible.”

The actor-come-liberal activist/artist went on to suggest that McConnell is worse than 9/11 architect bin Laden because more than 10,000 Americans have been killed by guns so far this year and ""only"" 3,000 innocent lives were lost during the worst terror attacks in American history.

Carrey claims that because he hasn’t brought any gun control legislation to the floor, McConnell's actions are worse than those of the man who masterminded the 9/11 attacks.

Mr. Carrey tweeted the accusation with a copy of his ""artwork"" - a drawing of a $100 bill being dipped in blood.

In November last year, Hollywood Carrey took a vicious swipe at President Donald Trump during a Vulture Fest panel in Los Angeles.

During the event, the liberal actor called the president a ""rapist"" and likened him to ""melanoma"" during his latest anti-American rant.

Carrey went on to describe Trump as cancer that former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was covering it with “makeup.”

The Canadian multi-millionaire also accused Republicans of being “criminal” and said the GOP is “raping our system” and “destroying” America.

""You cannot be bipartisan with a criminal,"" Carrey declared, speaking about the president.

""A rapist needs to be removed, not negotiated with,” he continued.

“These people are raping our system, they’re destroying it right in front of us.”

Carrey’s most recent work came after a series of mass shootings that killed dozens of people.

McConnell said Tuesday he would bring a gun bill to the floor if President Trump supported it and it could realistically become a law."

Think the attempted fake suicide by Bayou Capital’s Sam Israel which dominated the headlines for a few days in 2008 was strange? You ain’t seen nothing yet: as the following excerpt of Octopus, The Secret Market And The World’s Wildest Con by Guy Lawson via the Daily Mail explains, that was merely the anticlimatic culmination of an amazing tale of bogus London traders, ‘secret’ Bond markets, frontrunning the Fed, fake CIA and MI6 spies, ponzi schemes and staged murders.

His family had stayed at Claridge’s for generations, and Sam moved with ease and entitlement.

Passing through the revolving doors, Israel stepped into the quintessence of London sophistication and money.

Some of the stunning excerpts. All of this happened.

Vodka and cocaine were his way of coping, and he was becoming desperate.

At home his life was in crisis. He was plagued by back problems, and prescription drugs barely dulled the pain.

Israel needed a game-changing trading strategy that would make him tens of millions – and he needed it fast.

By spring 2004, Bayou was down more than $100 million.

But by the time of the first audit, Israel had been forced to start falsifying Bayou’s accounts – first in a panic to cover a single bad bet on gold, then systematically to hide regular losses.

Israel had been running his own hedge fund, Bayou, since 1996. To begin with returns were good.

For nearly a century his family had traded in cocoa, coffee, sugar and rubber, and become fantastically wealthy along the way.

His wife had thrown him out of the family home and he was renting a mansion owned by Donald Trump, complete with an 800-gallon saltwater fish tank and a menagerie of rare reptiles.

Frontrunning the Fed is where it’s at:

He’d heard about a top-secret computer programme that enabled U.S. Intelligence Services to covertly see when and where the Federal Reserve injected money into the market. Getting his hands on the programme would allow him to stay one step ahead, Israel calculated. And the man who could get the software was a self-professed super-spook called Robert Booth Nichols. The pair met at Israel’s third-floor suite in Claridge’s.

Nichols was alleged to be a CIA assassin, arms dealer and mob associate, involved in almost every nefarious covert plot carried out by the U.S. government for three decades. He said he was part of a secret organisation dubbed ‘Octopus’ because its tentacles were wrapped around every aspect of society. In fact, Nichols was a conman, whose house of mirrors made Israel’s own Ponzi scheme – in which investors were paid returns from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors – seem tiny in comparison. And like an episode of Hustle, Nichols would soon spin Israel an elaborate web of lies and deceit – involving bogus banks and traders across several European cities, the Zapruder film of President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 and even a faked death – in an attempt to swindle him out of millions of dollars.

Frontrunning the Fed turns out is for amateurs: just trade in the Fed’s shadow market:

Nichols told Israel to forget the computer software he was after – that he could get him much better returns trading bonds in a secret market Israel would never be able to gain access to unless he had $150 million in cash. The institutions of the modern world – the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund, the largest banks – were all a front, Nichols said. To keep the market solvent, the Fed secretly issued bonds at a huge discount and they were then traded in a shadow market. The margins were huge. But the public could never know about it or there would be widespread panic. Israel was instantly hooked. He wanted in.

A whirl of meetings followed, including one at the Grosvenor House hotel, where Israel was introduced to Nigel Finch and John Cassidy. According to Nichols, Finch, a veteran of MI6 with a refined accent, was the key to gaining entry to the secret bond market. He ran a fine-art store and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. Cassidy, claimed Nichols, was a former CIA station chief in Hong Kong and a descendant of Butch Cassidy, the notorious outlaw of the Wild West. Nichols, Finch and Cassidy said they had assisted wealthy people into the trades for years. But they hadn’t been able to trade on their own account and reap the billion-dollar benefits. With Israel’s $150 million, they would at last have the chance to get into the game as principals. They warned him, however, that simply attempting to enter the shadow market was extremely dangerous. Israel could be murdered at any moment by a rival faction.

It’s the new American tradition. Now it’s politically correct to remove Native American names from sports teams. Don’t talk about small pox blankets and decimating buffalo from the windows of steam engine trains. Just remove a word, no worries. No harm done. Withholding evidence is also a lie. Change the message, bury the truth. Like around fourteen years ago, when men and women destroyed the evidence of Merck’s MMR vaccine showing a causal relationship with autism, with increased risk reserved for African American male children. Corrupted souls filled with fraud, deception, flat out lying to Congress and themselves did not have the mindset of “do no harm.” CDC scientists destroyed the proof that children injected with the MMR vaccine could very well have a full cognitive life taken from them via autism. If truth were told, their profits and brotherhood would suffer, so, no worries, just destroy the evidence and go on your merry way. Change a word or two. Allow another slaughter of the innocent begin. And when the truth starts to trickle out it is ignored, suppressed or mocked. But the truth cannot be contained. Here’s an except from the Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s interview with Alex Jones:

“I’m twenty years into this battle, and it could have continued the way it was going, until one man stepped forward, [William Thompson] a senior scientist, a CDC insider saying, “I was in charge of a study where we tested a hypotheses and we found the MMR vaccination was causally associated with autism and we hid the findings. We hid it for fourteen years and we have know for fourteen years that this vaccine is causally associated with autism and we have concealed it. We’ve put millions of Americas children in harms way and I can live with that no longer.”

It’s a note of hope that a man no longer can live with his lie. So he turns away and walks a new direction. That’s called repentance. America must follow suite.

You must see the movie VAXXED and spread the truth

Andrew Wakefield, made the film featuring William Thompson, a former CDC senior scientist turned whistleblower. Thompson has provided the world 100% proof that even the then top dog of the CDC, Judy Gerberding, M.D., knew Merck’s MMR vaccine would harm children. Back in 2004, Ms. Gerberding was too busy vying for her new revolving door job as President of the Vaccine Division of Merck. Call those revolving doors kickbacks, bribery or sociopathic fascism, whatever the monogram, autism has skyrocketed, parents are grieving and our nation is killing it’s young, not just the 60 million in the womb, but the infants who are born healthy, have a vaccination and never speak again.

Lying has taken on a life of its own. America, Lies are U.S.

It’s imperative to share this interview. Another part of the discussion mentions neonatal nurses who have been tasked with giving underweight infants vaccinations. And when that happens, these children die.

The proof, and the truth about food, fluoride, Big Pharma, Fukushima, birth certificate bond trust documents, banking and the march toward NWO is out there. Find it and be set free."

Check out the latest drought map of the state. Almost 100% of the state is in severe drought conditions. Many parts of the West are also experiencing drought, but California is ground-zero. This is a huge food growing region, and the state has just started restricting water to agriculture. This is a vast problem not only for the U.S., but the entire world, and there is no end in sight. California is a state with a population of nearly 40 million people. Some towns have been cut off, and some people are starting to store drinking water in their homes. This could spark a humanitarian crisis and a financial crisis. You cannot live or do business without ample supplies of water. California has a GDP of $2.2 trillion. Agriculture alone is $46 billion a year. Failure of California business would be a financial failure for the U.S. It is only projected to get worse. Is this a black swan hiding in plain sight? Might I remind you that in March, NASA said California had about one year’s worth of water before it runs out. So, we are t-minus 9 months and counting.

The Greek debt crisis got kicked into a higher gear and is speeding for default and disaster. Technically, I think the Greeks have already defaulted long ago because they are borrowing more and more money to pay their debts. This week, the Greek politicians said debt owed to the EU was “illegal and illegitimate.” They cannot and will not pay the money back. The only question remains is when does the default become official. It’s reported the Greek’s have run on the banks there, and they do not know if they will open on Monday. Will someone like the Federal Reserve step in and buy some time. Greece is a NATO country, and it just signed a gas pipeline deal with Russia. It’s getting complicated. Will someone like the Federal Reserve step in and buy some time? Does the EU cough up the remaining 7.2 billion euro loan package to kick the can towards the cliff? Who knows, but end it will sooner than later.

The Federal Reserve will not be raising rates, and it has reduced the growth estimates it had. Gregory Mannarino says, “The Fed cannot and will not be raising rates because it can’t.” He points to recent so-called core inflation rates just announced of .1%. Of course, it’s much higher than that, but Mannarino says the Fed is only worried about the “core rate.” There is no growth and if the Fed raised rates, it would implode the economy. And yet, the mainstream press says “Fed on track to raise rates this fall.” IMF Head Christine Lagarde just publicly scolded the Fed and told them “not to raise rates” because the economy was too weak. Then you have this out earlier in the week from the same USA Today that says “Bonds haven status gets shaky.” Meanwhile, the AP reports in the same week “Economists don’t fear rise in rates.” Really?? Maybe someone should tell that to Christine Lagarde and the entire bond market the raising interest rates are not going to be a problem—NOT.

Looks like the GOP got a win in the secret trade deal. The House narrowly passed part of the trade deal. It is the so-called Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA. Republican Congressman Paul Ryan said, “The TPA is a process and not an agreement.” Of course, he did not say and none of the other mainstream media (MSM) don’t think a secret trade deal is a problem. Ryan also said the TPA is “more accountable and more transparent.” Yes, “more transparent” that’s why it is being done in secret. Congressmen and Senators have to go into a room alone and read hundreds of pages. It is illegal for the public to see the deal until it is passed. There is an old saying, and that is “evil is done in the dark and good is done in the light.” This is being done in the dark.

 With the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq, the administration, the military and the media are trying to put a positive spin on this grim chapter of U.S. history. It would certainly give some comfort to the grieving families of the over 4,400 soldiers killed in Iraq if their sacrifices had left Iraq a better place or made America safer. But the bitter truth is that the U.S. intervention has been an utter disaster for both Iraq and the United States.

First let’s acknowledge that we should have never attacked Iraq to begin with. Iraq had no connection with our 9/11 attackers, had no weapons of mass destruction and represented no threat to the United States. We were pushed into this war on the basis of lies and no one–not George Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Karl Rove, Donald Rumsfeld-has been held accountable. The “think tanks,” journalists and pundits who perpetuated the lies have not been fired. Most of them can be found today cheerleading for the war in Afghanistan.

Update (1316ET): Today’s EU meeting to work out a bloc-wide rescue package ended with no agreement, as was widely expected. And as the euro comes under pressure, anonymously-sourced reports claimed that the four wealthy northern states (led by Germany) are insisting on tying the recovery aid to the next EU long-term budget. Meanwhile, the badly hit already indebted nations like Italy are demanding that the bloc agree to issue “coronabonds” to finance what will in all likelihood become a huge recovery effort.

In other news, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Turkey surpassed 100,000 on Thursday, with the death toll topping 2,491. A week ago, Turkey surpassed Iran to become the country with the worst outbreak in the Middle East, but it’s not the only country suffering: Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman and Qatar are all seeing cases and deaths climb at disturbingly high rates despite precautionary measures and travel restrictions imposed across the region.

Interestingly enough, Turkey is actually the first country in Asia to cross the 100k-case threshold (since China’s “official” count topped out around 80k). Of course, it’s widely believed that the number of cases in China was many times more. Turkey is also only the 7th country in the world to cross the threshold.

Update (1155ET): Offering his rundown of the latest stats, Cuomo said that deaths have come down (the state reported 438 on Thursday vs 474 yesterday), though not by as much as state officials would like. Cuomo also noted that the number of people ‘walking in the door’ at NY State hospitals with COVID-19 has remained “about even” at roughly 1,300 per day.

But by far the most interesting piece of information shared by Cuomo on Thursday was the outcome of a random surveillance test – the first of what’s expected to be many rounds of random testing that the state will be conducting to help aid the response. Cuomo said that out of 3,000 people tested for COVID-19 antibodies, roughly 14% tested positive.

Even more alarming, that rate rose to 21.2% positive rate in NY. If that rate is confirmed via further testing, it would suggest that roughly 2 million NYC residents have been exposed to the virus.

“It changes the theories of what the death rate is,” Cuomo explained. “It’s preliminary data”…but there are likely more unconfirmed “at home deaths” from the virus, he sad.

Of course, if these data are borne out by more studies, it would dramatically lower the virus’s mortality rate.

During Mayor de Blasio’s press briefing earlier on Thursday, Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said that she would not be surprised if “close to a million New Yorkers” had been exposed to COVID-19. And as the city’s economy slides into a recessionary slump, De Blasio also offered a stark statistic: he expects that an additional one million residents could become food insecure under the pandemic, putting the total number of food insecure New Yorkers at around two million.

Moving on, the governor also responded to a comment by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reportedly made during an appearance on a conservative talk show, that he would be in favor of some US states using “the bankruptcy route” to shed the onerous debt obligations they’re accruing during the outbreak.

Of course, the minute a US state files for bankruptcy, we suspect the market selloff will be even more swift than the unprecedented plunges seen just last month.

If there’s even anything left of the American economy at that point.

In other news, as the US pulls its funding from the WHO, China is stepping up with a $30 million donation, virtually guaranteeing that Beijing’s influence over the NGO – which is essentially an independent organization despite technically being an arm of the UN – will only continue to grow. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang praised the organization during a briefing, saying the WHO played “an important role” in assisting countries during the pandemic response.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that the US “may never” restore funding to the WHO, unless major reforms are implemented. “We reformed this back in 2007, so this isn’t the first time we’ve had to deal with the shortcomings of this organization that sits inside the United Nations. We need a fix. We need a structural fix with the WHO,” Pompeo said. Trump suspended US funding for the organization, accusing it of supporting China’s “disinformation,” Reuters reports.

Even the biggest supporter of vaccines will NOT believe their eyes! (the video – below – says it all.)

Simply put, (and the evidence is undeniable) vaccines and related pharmaceuticals are literally rushed to the market without proper testing and verification. We, at NaturalHealth365, have been talking about this for years – but, now, we have (video) proof.

In reality, “test results” are derived from consumers. Safety data on these drugs literally are not available until people start taking the vaccine.

During this horrifying revelation captured on video (below), it is even admitted that we and our children are supposed to be the ‘guinea pigs’ for these vaccines in lieu of clinical testing.

Here is the full video released by the CDC from the 2018 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) conference. The most relevant portion begins at the 47:23 mark and continues until one hour 7 seconds:

A more condensed and concise Facebook version is available at this link:

Some vaccine ingredients include the adjuvants aluminum, chromium and mercury, which are known neurotoxins. They are bad enough for adults, but when administered to children, exposure to these substances far exceeds CDC recommended safe levels. (Should any amount of metal in a food or drug be considered safe?!)

Here’s another valid point to consider: despite vaccine use, the incidents of many diseases and health conditions are actually higher. Rates of cervical cancer, infectious diseases and autism are still way to high – especially when you consider the fact that vaccines are supposed to reduce our risk.

In addition to vaccine side effects such as neurological problems and autism, vaccines have also been linked to many autoimmune disorders. One has to wonder why autoimmune diseases are on the rise.

The National Institutes of Health reports that up to 23.5 million Americans have an autoimmune condition.

We MUST admit the obvious: Leadership – within the medical community – IS aware of unsafe vaccines

For example, a pair of Italian scientists have verified unsafe levels of contaminants in vaccines in a 2017 study.

Using electron-microscopy, they examined 30 human and veterinary vaccines, including for hepatitis, influenza, cervical cancer, meningitis and allergies. ALL BUT ONE of the tested samples tested positive for inorganic contaminants.

Both single types of contaminants and disturbing assemblages of toxic substances were found in the vaccines. The researchers admitted to being “baffled” by the bizarre compositions of some of these contaminant combinations.

Lead particles were found in cervical cancer vaccines Cervarix and Gardasil, as well as in the meningitis vaccine Meningetec and the seasonal flu vaccine Aggripal. In addition to heavy metals, red cells from either humans or animals were found in some of the drugs. (how can doctors think this is ‘safe!’)

WARNING: Incidents of autoimmune disease and other conditions higher despite vaccine use

The researchers believe these contaminants are causing the immune system to react, releasing microphages to fight the foreign bodies. This leads to systemic inflammation and the other characteristics of autoimmune disease.

In a pattern that is all too familiar, not long after the husband and wife team released their findings, their home was raided by Italian police and their data seized.

It’s time to speak up and demand that vaccines be thoroughly tested before release to the public. Parents should continue to fight for the right to opt out of vaccine programs unless and until they are properly tested and verified as safe."

One reader on the USAWatchdog site told me his family plan doubled to more than $1,600 a month with much higher deductibles and co-pays. I have not had a single person on the site write me and tell me they are paying less. Forget about the website problems in the end, most people are going to be paying more and getting less for health care. This is just the individual plans where millions are finding out you cannot keep your old plan. It’s not cheaper, and in most cases, you cannot keep your doctor. This is why 16 Democratic Senators, who are all up for re-election in 2014, met with the White House this week. They are worried, and they should be. I predicted this would be an ongoing disaster for Democrats, and it is. Why do you think they put off the employer mandate? In the end, everyone is going to take a hit and pay more for less. They are going for a single payer system and don’t care who they hurt to get there. Democrats already realize this is a loser and are going to get creamed in 2014. How do you put this genie back into the bottle? You can’t. The other big unreported story is the extremely negative drag this is going to have on the economy. You can’t take that much money from people and have a growing vibrant economy.

The major countries of the world are negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program. Iran wants the harsh sanctions lifted, and the West wants the nuclear plan curtailed. This headline says there’s a deal taking shape. Meanwhile, other headlines are saying Iran is demanding the right to increase the programs it has in place. The Middle East still has the potential to be the most explosive and complicated problem on earth. Keep an eye on the negotiations; everyone in the past few years has failed to produce anything meaningful.

In economic news, a university professor from the University of Missouri, Kansas City, says the real size of the Fed exposure for rescuing the global economy from the 2008 meltdown is not nearly $4 trillion but a whopping $29 trillion!! This is a report from 2011, but it has resurfaced. Professor L. Randall Wray contends the Fed has dramatically underestimated the amount of cash the Fed has pumped into the global financial system. If you add the amount of QE (money printing) since the 2011 report what is the amount now?

If the Fed has pumped that much money into the system, it should be talking off like a rocket. Instead, we keep getting headlines like this one, “Financial Firms Slashing Jobs.” 49,000 jobs have been cut, and if the economy was expanding, shouldn’t jobs be financing new projects and homes be expanding? Wait until Obama Care fully kicks in.

Finally, did you hear about the Texas size debris field floating in the Pacific Ocean that is headed for the West coast of the U.S. according to NOAA? Yes, a U.S. government website is tracking this mess. This debris is not reported to be radioactive, but there are plenty of other stories that show the West Coast of the U.S. is being hit with radiation from Fukushima. This story is being ignored by the mainstream media. Things are not getting better with Fukushima fallout, they are getting worse.

953,True,The article suggests that Presidential Policy Directive 19 (PPD19) could have been exploited by a network of intelligence employees loyal to Obama in case Romney was elected and made significant changes to foreign policy.

Presidential Policy Directive 19, which was signed on Oct. 10, 2012, expanded whistleblower protection to “intelligence community” employees – but notably not contractors – by allowing them to retain their security clearances among other things.

PPD19 came into the spotlight in 2013 because analysts pointed out that it didn’t provide protection to Edward Snowden partly because he was a government contractor.

According to an Aug. 12, 2013 article by the Washington Post:

There are thousands upon thousands of federal contractors who have security clearances but relatively little protection if they disclose waste, fraud or abuse in government programs.

Retaliation by supervisors against whistleblowers is real in Uncle Sam’s operations, as Obama’s policy directive indicates.

But that directive covers only “any employee serving in an Intelligence Community Element.” The operative word here is “employee.”

Excluding contractors “is a remarkable and obviously intentional oversight, given the significant number of contractors who now work within the intelligence community,” according to Washington lawyer Mark Said.

A journalist recently suggested that PPD19 could have been exploited by a “stay behind” network of intelligence employees loyal to Obama in case Romney was elected and made significant changes to foreign policy.

“The Obama administration would not have been too worried about Romney reversing its social policies, but Romney had run sharply against Obama on national security,” wrote Daniel Greenfield. “And Obama’s cronies knew that there would be significant foreign policy differences there.”

“PPD19 may have been their answer.”

An op/ed in the Washington Post recently claimed President Trump was wrong about the recent whistleblower rules being changed because policy “has been virtually unchanged since 2014,” but interestingly the 2014 policy implemented PPD19.

In other words, according to Greenfield, PPD19 could be weaponized against not just Trump in particular, but any president who threatened the DC status quo on foreign issues, including the theoretical President Romney.

Romney was leading national polls in early Oct. 2012, roughly a month before the presidential election.

954,True,"The article suggests that the Bush administration has committed numerous impeachable offenses and has escaped accountability for them.

The Bush administration's greatest success is its ability to escape accountability for its numerous impeachable offenses.

The administration's offenses against US law, the US Constitution, civil liberties, human rights, and the Geneva Conventions, its lies to Congress and the American people, its vote-rigging scandals, its sweetheart no-bid contracts to favored firms, its political firing of Republican US Attorneys, its practice of kidnapping and torturing people in foreign hellholes, and its persecution of whistle blowers are altogether so vast that it is a major undertaking just to list them all.

Bush admits that he violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and spied on US citizens without warrants, a felony under the Act. Bush has shown total disrespect for civil liberty and the Constitution and has suffered rebukes from the Supreme Count. The evidence is overwhelming that the Bush administration manufactured false ""intelligence"" to justify military aggression against Iraq. The Halliburton contract scandals are notorious, as is the use of electronic voting machines programmed to miscount the actual vote.

The chief-of-staff to Vice President Cheney has been convicted for obstructing justice in the outing of a covert CIA officer. Proof of torture is overwhelming, and the Bush administration has even had the temerity to have permissive legislation passed after the fact that permits it to continue to torture ""detainees."" The Sibel Edmonds and other whistle blower cases are well known. The Senate Judiciary Committee has just issued subpoenas to Justice (sic) Dept. officials involved in the scandalous removal of US Attorneys who refused to be politicized.

Yet the Democrats have taken impeachment ""off the table."" Many Democrats and Republicans and a great many Christians can contemplate illegal military aggression against Iran, but not the impeachment of the greatest criminal administration in US history. Far from being scandalized by what the entire world views as an unjust invasion and occupation of Iraq by the US, leading Democratic and Republican candidates for the 2008 presidential nomination rushed to inform the Israel Lobby, AIPAC, that they, if elected, will keep US troops in Iraq.

The previous occupant of the White House could not escape being impeached by the House of Representatives for lying about a consensual Oval Office sexual affair. President Nixon and his vice president, a saintly pair compared to Bush-Cheney, were both driven from office for offenses that are inconsequential by comparison. Liberals branded Ronald Reagan the ""Teflon President,"" but the neoconservatives' Iran-Contra scandal was a mere dress rehearsal for their machinations in the Bush regime.

Perhaps the answer is that Bush has desensitized us. Like kids desensitized to violence by violent video games and movies and pornography addicts desensitized to sex, we have become desensitized by the avalanche of Bush-Cheney crimes, lies, and disdain for Congress, courts, and public opinion.

Our elected representatives, if not the American people, now regard as normal such heinous actions as war crimes, the rape of the Constitution, self-serving use of government office, and the constant stream of lies and propaganda from the highest offices of the executive branch.

Perhaps that is what disillusioned foreigners, who once looked with hope to America, mean when they say that America does not exist anymore.

If the notion has departed that the highest political offices in the land are supposed to be occupied by people who are honest and faithful to their oath to the Constitution, then we are far advanced on the road to tyranny.

In future history books, will Bush-Cheney mark the transition of the United States from constitutional rule to the unaccountable rule of the unitary executive who cancels out Congress with signing statements and silences critics with the police state means that are now part of the US legal code?

Paul Roberts has it correct, ""The Bush administration's greatest success is its ability to escape accountability for its numerous impeachable offenses."" Congress ought to arrest President Bush and his accomplices for treason, theft of taxpayer money, conspiracy against the American people, mass murder, lying, license, obstruction of justice, falsification of evidence, aiding and abetting terrorists, and for betraying an oath of office to uphold the U.S. Constitution!!! Benedict Arnold is a national hero compared to George W. Bush.

I will criticize anyone who causes the deaths of tens-of-thousands of innocent people. Oh, excuse me, the death toll is now at 655,000!!! Scratch that, the death toll is now at 1,366,350 as of late 2009! When will the killing stop? President Obama has sent 80,000 more troops into Afghanistan and Iraq since being sword into office, after promising to bring the troops home while campaigning. Obama lied. In fact, he lied about dozens of things, many of which are documented in this shocking film . . .

America's youth have been sent off to die needlessly by the thousands. For those who aren't killed in the battle, they'll return home with all sorts of illnesses due to the horrifying consequence of DU (Depleted Uranium). It was all a war based upon lies and fraud, just as The Gulf of Tonkin incident that fraudulently involved the U.S. into Vietnam, and FDR's fraudulent Pearl Harbor attacked, which he caused, to involve the U.S. in WW2. Every major war since The Revolutionary War has been started, financed and nurtured by the international banking Cartel, i.e., the Banksters.

 Location: Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China

In a residential community in Wuhan, each building has been under lockdown for more than 20 days. Residents in these high-rise buildings can only go downstairs to pick up deliveries of food and other necessities. A woman in this community lamented that there were two more confirmed cases of infection despite the strict lockdown measures.

 –

 Woman: It’s 12 noon on March 14. There are not many cars on the street. The most annoying news I just heard is although every building in our community has been under lockdown for over 20 days, there are still new infections. I literally had a headache upon hearing the news, and I did not sleep well last night. What shall we do? The whole city of Wuhan reported four new infections today, two of them are from our community. In addition, there are six more suspected coronavirus patients in our community. Tell me, what’s to be done? With the current restrictions, it’s already very difficult for us to go downstairs. I don’t know how much longer we have to stay indoors. We have stayed at home for two months. I guess our community will be the last one in Wuhan to…

 This woman doesn’t have access to information about other communities. When she heard there were two new infections among her neighbors, and Wuhan authorities reported four new cases that day, she thought her neighborhood is experiencing the worst situation in the whole city."

As I’ve noted in my recent work, many globalist agenda items are up for grabs as the world continues to freak out about the novel coronavirus and Covid-19. So is this the main event? Is the disease much worse than it’s being portrayed? Are reinfections after “recovery” common? And what should we do to prepare. James tackles these questions in depth in this edition of Questions For Corbett.

Kennedy, Jr., of ChildrensHealthDefense.org.

See this screen capture from Amazon on May 16th:

Dr. Mikovits has been banned by all the usual techno-fascists, and all interviews of her — as well as the “Plandemic” documentary videos — have been meticulously stripped from YouTube, Facebook and even Vimeo.

Why are the tech giants so desperate to silence Dr. Mikovits and prevent her from presenting information that’s relevant to the current pandemic? Because she knows the truth about vaccines and how dangerous they are to public health. (And she’s not afraid to talk about it.)

I interviewed Dr. Mikovits yesterday afternoon. The interview would be banned on YouTube, of course, but fortunately we built Brighteon.com as a free speech video platform where people may openly question the establishment about the coronavirus “plandemic,” vaccines, lockdowns, Big Pharma medical experiments and much more.

 Former Secret Service officer Gary J. Byrne is the author of the 2016 bestseller, Crisis of Character: A White House Secret Service Officer Discloses His Firsthand Experience with Hillary, Bill, and How They Operate. Byrne concludes that from his experiences, Hillary Clinton “lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office” of the U.S. presidency.

 

 On June 15, 2018, in the District of Columbia District Court, Gary Byrne filed a civil lawsuit, Byrne v. Clinton Foundation et al, Case no. 1:2018cv01422, against these individuals and organizations for RICO — racketeering and fraud. In alphabetical order, the defendants are:
• : Democrat super PAC founded by David Brock (#2 below) in 2010 and associated with Brock’s Media Matters (see #11 below).
• : A Democrat Party operative, Clinton crony, and former boyfriend of Comet Ping Pong owner, James Alefantis.
• None Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington : A supposedly non-partisan, non-profit, government ethics and accountability watchdog organization that is identified by both the New York Times and Fox News as “liberal”.

• : A former Secret Service agent who is now a CNN law enforcement analyst and managing director of Teneo Risk, a strategic threat advisory firm.

RICO is the acronym for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act — a U.S. federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. The RICO Act focuses specifically on racketeering — a planned or organized criminal operation — and enables the leaders of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ordered others to do or assisted them in doing. In so doing, RICO closes a loophole that had allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.

 Byrne’s case has been assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman, who was appointed in 1994 by Bill Clinton to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

It also mentions the routine blocking of natural sunlight by the chemtrails.",True,The article implies secrecy by mentioning that the fuel dump was not done over an unoccupied area as required by law. This suggests an intention to mislead the public and divert attention.,"Delta airplane caught “chemtrailing” schoolchildren with fuel during emergency landing at LAX

In a bizarre and highly disturbing incident that took place in the sunny skies above Southern California, a Delta Air Lines flight headed towards Shanghai, China, blasted an elementary schoolyard with fuel during an emergency U-turn landing back at LAX (Los Angeles International Airport), giving a whole new meaning to the term “chemtrailing.”

Reports indicate that the Boeing 777 airplane, which had departed just after 11 a.m., suffered some kind of “mechanical issue” not long after takeoff that required an immediate return to the airport. And in order to land safely, the jet had to dump its fuel load prior to landing.

But rather than dump it over the ocean or some other unoccupied area as is required by law, the pilots of Flight 89 decided to spray the fuel over a residential area where students were outside playing, exposing at least 20 of them and 11 of their teachers to the toxic particulates.

While the emergency fuel dump primarily affected Park Avenue Elementary School in Los Angeles, additional students and faculty at San Gabriel Avenue Elementary School in South Gate, Jordan High School and 93rd Street Elementary School in South Los Angeles, Graham Elementary School in Inglewood, and Tweedy Elementary School in South Gate, are also said to have been potentially exposed.

Another individual reportedly told CBS News in Los Angeles that the fuel was also dumped over PIH Health hospital in nearby Whittier, while workers at an electroplating shop in Orange County told the media that they could see and smell tiny droplets of jet fuel that ended up blanketing their cars.

Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary ""sulforaphane"" and ""glucosinolate"" nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.

Delta Air Lines has since released an official statement indicating that the airplane in question had “conducted an emergency fuel release while in flight,” and that the company is in “close communication” with first responders who are looking into the situation.

If more of the public knew about chemtrails, this emergency fuel dump would pale in comparison

As to what went wrong with yet another Boeing airplane, CBS News says that the pilots of the 777 received a notification after takeoff about “a possible compressor stall affecting [the plane’s] right engine.” They immediately radioed air traffic control, declared an emergency, and headed back to LAX.

“A compressor stall – or compressor stall warning – is a sign of an engine issue that typically prompts an engine shutdown,” CBS News explains.

Thankfully, the plane landed safely and nobody on board was injured, though some on the ground may have accidentally ingested or gotten fuel residues in their eyes, which from the sound of it spread all across the Southland.

As disturbing as this all is, it’s nothing compared to what’s being dumped daily all around the world from jet planes in the form of chemtrails, which are polluting our skies with stratospheric aerosol injections of chemicals like aluminum, barium and strontium.

There could also be biologicals like viral fragments and contagions hiding in those white, hazy mists that routinely block out our natural sunlight while dousing our planet with unknown poisons. The official story is that these chemtrails exist to prevent “global warming,” but we all know that’s a bald-faced lie.

“Now it can be tested for additives involved in chemtrail spraying: barium salts, aluminum and such,” wrote one chemtrail-aware CBS News commenter about the fuel residues from the 777 airplane.

Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, describes the chemtrail phenomenon as geogenocide because it’s entirely incompatible with humans and other life forms. Be sure to check out this article he wrote that provides an in-depth look at the horrors of chemtrails.

961,True,"The article suggests that there is a conspiracy to dumb down the American population through various means such as processed foods, media manipulation, and propaganda.",True,"The article mentions powerful actors such as the mainstream media, state-run media, and the government.",True,"The article discusses actions taken by the powerful actors to dumb down the populace, such as brainwashing and propaganda.",False,The article does not explicitly mention any threats.,True,The article connects various events and observations to support the claim of a conspiracy to dumb down Americans.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy or attempts to mislead the public.,"I’m taking the gloves completely off here. I’ve inferred that Americans collectively are pretty gullible and naive. I’ve invoked comparisons to Mike Judge’s movie Idiocracy. But it’s time to simply tell it like it is: the majority of present-day Americans are stupid beyond belief.

This doesn’t include all the increasing number of “awake” people out there, but it certainly does include the newly coined “woke” folk, who seem to be sleeping more soundly than the average American dupe. Ironically, a lot of these “woke” Americans are “mad as hell” but their anger is focused exclusively on Donald Trump. They figure if they can just get him to go away, things will be back to normal. “Normal” being the kind of nonstop corruption I wrote about in Hidden History.

My bleak assessment has some scientific evidence to back it up. Even mainstream sources report that IQ scores all over the world have been dropping for decades. Some estimates put the IQ drop at about 7 points for each subsequent generation born after 1975. These studies were centered in Norway, or other parts of the western world. My guess is that the average American IQ, if anything, has decreased more sharply than that.

There are plenty of factors here. The increased consumption of processed foods, poisonous preservatives, GMO products, and the constant stress everyone is subjected to by the modern world have all contributed. Insipid and offensive films and television shows, dishonest state-run media, and wrong-headed public school systems were even more crucial in dumbing down the populace. Nonstop propaganda- really brainwashing- has turned many Americans into unthinking, unquestioning sheep who lack both empathy and a moral compass.

Consider all that Americans have permitted over just the last thirty years. They fell for the “invasion” of Kuwait nonsense, and were ready to send their children to die in a place they wouldn’t have been able to locate on a map the week before. They parroted the mainstream media line about Saddam Hussein being a “brutal” madman, when they previously wouldn’t have been able to identify him. They fell for the “babies in incubators” line from the crying young girl, and didn’t blink when she was exposed as the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador lobbying for war.

Enough Americans bought Bill Clinton’s obsequious “I feel your pain” charade to elect him president twice. They ignored the growing body count and the outrageous corruption that began in Arkansas during his tenure as governor, as studiously as the fawning mainstream media did.

We crossed one of those important moral lines in the sand when the majority of Americans stood by silently as armored tanks demolished a home (smeared continuously in the media as a “compound”) and poured deadly gas banned by the Geneva Convention inside, killing civilians that included a large number of children. What happened at Waco should have garnered impeachment charges against Bill Clinton, with criminal charges to follow. Instead, the inventor of identity politics was re-elected, and continued to garner almost 100 percent support from Hollywood.

Americans accepted the ridiculous magical fertilizer bomb theory at Oklahoma City, and cheered when patsy Timothy McVeigh was executed in record time. They swallowed the “JFK Jr. was reckless” accidental death theory in 1999, and no one exposed the truth about this latest Kennedy assassination until I investigated and wrote about it in Hidden History.

On September 11, 2001, we crossed a line that will be very difficult to step back from. Up until that point, no steel frame high rise had ever collapsed from fire. On that day, three did- including Building 7, which was not struck by any aircraft. Since then, no building has. A magical day indeed, and one which exposed the new collective stupidity of Americans, as they stared transfixed at their television screens, as military “expert” after military “expert” told them that the “terrorists” had done this, and nothing would ever be the same.

The majority of Americans accepted that nineteen crazed Arabs, who admittedly were not qualified to fly planes, executed this terrorist plot flawlessly, led by the new bogeyman, Osama Bin Laden, from his secretive cave lair. The odious, unconstitutional Patriot Act was quickly passed, with virtually no opposition from any public figure, and the unconstitutional Homeland Security Department was created. “Free speech zones” became all the rage, without a peep of protest outside the world of “conspiracy theorists.”

Before 9/11, the majority of Americans accepted the results of the dubious 2000 presidential election, which featured the first widespread mention of “hanging chads” and suggestions of voter fraud. I exposed the long history of American electoral corruption in Hidden History. The ballot box lost any significance it had long ago. Even if they counted the votes honestly, no honest candidates are ever permitted to run for president in either “opposing” party. As Huey Long said before they killed him, you have a choice between Tweedledee and Tweedledum."

Contained within the dataset are 640,000 individual entries from at least 230 cities around the country – which includes latitude, longitude and “confirmed” numbers of cases at that location on a specific date ranging from February to late April.

That said, it’s unclear from the data what is classified as a “confirmed” case of COVID-19, while a lack of patient names or contact info make it impossible to verify the information.

The number could also be far higher. A single data entry outlined by those with access to the database contains two cases of the virus, reported at a church in the city of Harbin on March 17.

The number could also be lower. Reporters say it is not clear how the data was gathered – although the university website says it used a range of public resources. -Daily Mail

China officially claims that of the more than 84,000 cases in the country, just 4,600 people have died – figures which have been challenged or disproven by various methods.

An email conversation between AIM Patriot Jim and Conclave Michael gives us a lesson in how to spot a globalist:

Do we have any research on how the Aspen Institute was formed, its financiers, who is driving this institute, and affiliations? My reason is that I believe the Republican Party State Auditor, Kim Wyman, is a globalist agent inserted into WA state to put control mechanisms via the voting machine technology for the globalist left wing agenda. I would like to do a succinct hit piece on her if the evidence supports my theory.

No research on Aspen, but just look at their supporters.

I read through their menu of programs. They are definitely a globalist front for left wing change despite the moral signaling throughout their propaganda. Save the whales, green energy, AOC’s New Green Deal, etc. This is the foundation to which that Kim Wyman belongs, WA secretary of state.

It is funded by George Soros and the Open Society Foundation. Definitely a Fascist organization.

We told you about the INFOWAR that the globalists are waging against us, but didn’t tell us. Best way to win this long war, promoted Rhodes, was to make sure the enemy (that’s all us patriots out here) are ‘asleep’ -poorly educated, not fully informed, always struggling to survive.

…now back to Hamilton Brown, the slave master and trader known as great-granddaddy by Kamala Harris.

This Whiteley’s account is even mentioned in Hamilton Brown’s Wikipedia entry. However, the public Wikipedia version includes glaring omissions of its sanitized discussion of Hamilton Brown’s heinous support of slavery. Those omissions have been added to this version.

Here’s what Hamilton Brown told the young Englishman Whiteley about Jamaican slaves upon his arrival in Jamaica on Sep. 03, 1832 the year before the Slavery Abolition Act of 1933 was passed by the British Parliament:

Here is what Whiteley concluded from his observations after just seven weeks where his questions about the slave life and treatment led him to be threatened by a mob led by a spokesman named “Mr. Brown” (if not Hamilton Brown, then almost certainly a relative since Brown belonged to the group that threatened him – the Saint Ann’s Colonial Church Union) who forced him to flee the country for his life.

Remarkably, Wikipedia does not mention Kamala Harris’ relationship to slaver Hamilton Brown via her father Donald J. Harris, even though the relationship has been confirmed by her father who is a Stanford economics professor emeritus.

In the first of a three-part series, the newspaper said death certificates and interviews with experts indicated several hundred priests have died of AIDS-related illnesses since the mid-1980s and hundreds more are living with HIV, the virus that causes the disease.

""I think this speaks to a failure on the part of the church,"" said Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of the Archdiocese of Detroit. ""Gay priests and heterosexual priests didn't know how to handle their sexuality, their sexual drive. And so they would handle it in ways that were not healthy.""

The Star received 801 responses to questionnaires that were sent last fall to 3,000 of the 46,000 priests in the United States. The margin of error of the survey was 3.5 percentage points.

Six of 10 priests responding said they knew of at least one priest who had died of an AIDS-related illness, and one-third knew a priest living with AIDS. Three-fourths said the church needed to provide more education to seminarians on sexual issues.

""How to be celibate and to be gay at the same time, and how to be celibate and heterosexual at the same time, that's what we were never really taught how to do. And that was a major failing,"" Gumbleton said.

Asked about their sexual orientation, 75 percent said they were heterosexual, 15 percent said they were homosexual, and 5 percent said they were bisexual.

The Rev. John Keenan, who runs Trinity House, an outpatient clinic in Chicago for priests, said he believes most priests with AIDS contracted the disease through same-sex relations. He said he treated one priest who had infected eight other priests.

The Star said precise numbers of priests who have died of AIDS or become infected with HIV is unknown, partly because many suffer in solitude. When priests tell their superiors, the cases generally are handled quietly.

The newspaper cited the case of Bishop Emerson Moore, who left the Archdiocese of New York in 1995 and went to Minnesota, where he died in a hospice of an AIDS-related illness. His death certificate attributed the death to ""unknown natural causes"" and listed his occupation as ""laborer"" in the manufacturing industry.

After an AIDS activist filed a complaint, officials changed the cause of death to ""HIV-related illness,"" the Star said, but the occupation was not corrected.

The newspaper said the death rate among priests from AIDS appears to be at least four times that of the rate for the general U.S. population.

Some priests and behavioral experts believe the church has scared priests into silence by treating homosexual acts as an abomination and the breaking of celibacy vows as shameful, the Star said.

Catholic cardinals in the United States and high-ranking church officials in the Vatican declined requests to discuss the newspaper's findings, The Star reported. The Vatican referred questions to local bishops.

Bishop Raymond Boland of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph said the AIDS deaths show that priests are human.

""Much as we would regret it, it shows that human nature is human nature,"" he said. ""And all of us are heirs to all of the misfortunes that can be foisted upon the human race.""

More than a year and a half ago, EvG warned here on USAWatchdog.com that “risk is exponential and unmeasurable” because of the estimated two quadrillion of derivatives and debt in the global financial system. He also warned that “at some point, all hell will break loose.” Looks like hell has indeed broken loose because of the China virus, and now EvG contends, “The system is bankrupt. . . . The system is broken and bankrupt. This did not start now with the Coronavirus. It didn’t start in August and September (of 2019) when central banks said we would do everything we can with the Fed QE, repos and the ECB (European Central Bank) QE. . . . This started a long time ago. The system was broken at the beginning of this century. The 2007-2009 crisis was the first signal that the financial system was not functioning. They threw $25 trillion at it in financing and guarantees, etc., but I always said 2007-2009 was a rehearsal. We are now approaching, sadly, the real thing. This is the end of a two to three hundred year cycle. So, we are going to see some extremely difficult times. The Corona virus is a horrible catalyst, but that is all it is. It’s not the reason for the problem. The reason for the problem is a broken financial system . . . and now we are starting the final stage of the end of this financial system.”

EvG also says the reaction to the China virus is the same worldwide. EvG says, “You are seeing food shops with empty shelves. People are panicking. So, that is the first reaction to the Coronavirus, but they have not realized the big problem is in the financial markets. It is in a system that has no liquidity or money, and it has to print more and more. At some point, people will realize there is no money, and you will have the same reaction. People will be lining up outside of banks or they will go to their ATM machines to get money and, of course, they will have to reduce it. Now, in most countries, there is no cash. So, it is easy for them to shut off the system. There will absolutely be shortages of cash for people, otherwise, you will have bank runs.”

EvG contends, “They have managed to maintain totally false markets with no real price discovery, certainly since 2009, by just flooding the market with so much money. We don’t have any real markets. We don’t have any real prices. It’s all fake. It’s all fake because it’s all supported by fake money.”

So, real money, that EvG says is physical gold and silver, is going to be revalued much higher. EvG says, “Technically, gold and silver will soon start the next leg up. . . . What is happening right now is every single government is printing more and more money. You have one rescue package after another, and that’s just the beginning. So, now, central banks are your best friend if you want to own precious metals because they are going to do everything they can to debase the currency.”

EvG also predicts that before it’s over, the stock market will be down 90% or more. EvG says, “In 1929, the market crash took 2 ½ years to go down 90%. The bubble is much bigger now, so it could go very, very fast. . . . The risk is at a level now where the world cannot be saved.”

Off camera, EvG went on to say the biggest financial problem the world faces is in the bond market. EvG says, “The biggest crash will be in the bond market, and this crash will happen faster than anybody will believe.”

967,True,"The article suggests a link between peanut allergies and vaccine adjuvants, implying that medical professionals are intentionally not mentioning this connection.",True,The article mentions medical professionals who are not mentioning the link between peanut allergies and vaccine adjuvants.,True,The article suggests that medical professionals are intentionally not mentioning the link between peanut allergies and vaccine adjuvants.,False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects the increase in peanut allergies among Western children to the use of peanut oil as a hidden adjuvant in vaccines.,True,"The article implies that medical professionals are intentionally not mentioning the link between peanut allergies and vaccine adjuvants, suggesting secrecy.","“Epidemic” level of peanut allergies now impacting America, but medical professionals won’t mention link to vaccine adjuvants

Peanuts are high on the list of foods that kids are commonly allergic to these days. And for children who have this allergy, even the smallest exposure to a peanut can result in serious – even life-threatening – anaphylaxis. Experts freely admit that the peanut allergy situation in America is so serious as to be labelled “almost epidemic,” but insist they have no idea what’s causing the problem.

A report by Mount Sinai Hospital’s Jaffe Food Allergy Institute found that between 1997 and 2008, the number of kids with peanut allergies tripled, from just 1-in-250 to about 1-in-70. This is shocking when you consider that even a few decades ago peanut allergies were almost unheard of, and in Eastern countries like India, where children eat large amounts of peanuts, such allergies are extremely uncommon.

Clearly, something specific is causing this massive increase in peanut allergies among Western children. Could it be the fact that peanut oil is a common – though hidden – adjuvant in many of the vaccines routinely recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)? (Related: All 8 extreme childhood food allergies are also common ingredients in CDC-recommended vaccines… coincidence?)

CNBC recently reported that peanut and other food allergies are definitely on the increase in the United States. While Big Pharma has promised all kinds of miracle drugs to slowly expose children to peanuts or deal with the problem in some other way, the truth is that experts have no real, scientific evidence as to what is causing the problem – or what to do about it.

100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety. A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.

“It really is almost an epidemic,” Dr. Scott Sicherer, the The Jaffe Food Allergy Institute’s director, told CNBC. “It’s impossible to deny an increase, even with anecdotal reports from school nurses.” He added that “about two (children) per classroom have food allergies. It’s not just our imagination.”

The National Institutes of Health insists that early exposure to allergenic foods could help mitigate the problem, but this can’t really be a solution, since, as already noted, kids in other countries where peanut consumption is massive don’t have anywhere near the same level of peanut allergies as American and other Western children do. (Related: Severe childhood allergies to peanuts, eggs and dairy directly linked to ‘trace’ ingredients in common vaccines.)

In the mid-1960s, peanut oils were first introduced into vaccines because scientists hypothesized they could “prolong” immunity. Somehow, they thought, the oil would act as a time release capsule. Within 20 years, peanut oil was the preferred “excipient” – meaning a substance formulated alongside the active ingredient of a medication for the purpose of long-term stabilization. The dangers of its use, however, were well-documented. The problem? Doctors and scientists had lumped immune response with immunity, making a grave mistake that’s still assumed to be true today. The myth is that the greater the allergic response to the vaccine, the greater the immunity that is conferred. Wrong!

So, as the number of mandated vaccines increased, and peanut oils were added as immunity-boosters, the number of children with peanut allergies increased exponentially. The link between vaccines and peanut allergies is therefore not confusing or obscure. It’s simple: Vaccines are full of things that are simply not good for our kids – including peanuts – and parents should be informed of that fact so that they can make the right decision about vaccinating their children.

Discussing the dire need to reopen the country with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham Tuesday, Marcus claimed the media was over-hyping the outbreak.

“Well, I think the media has done a wonderful job in frightening America,” Marcus stated, going on to hold Florida and Georgia up as examples of how the country needs vigorous reopen strategies to overcome the current economic downturn.

“What [Florida and Georgia] did is a perfect example of thinking and understanding that people need to get out of the house, needed to start their businesses again, needed to go to work again,” Marcus pointed out. “But there are bureaucrats all over the country in the blue states that are still closed, and God knows when they’ll open.”

“Those people [in Democrat-run states], they are still struggling and it is a desperate time for many of them,” added Marcus, a member of the White House Reopening task force.

The 91-year-old home improvement tycoon also said states should customize reopen strategies to target the elderly and most vulnerable, meaning public schools should reopen since children aren’t at a high risk of contracting coronavirus.

“My age bracket is really the problem,” said Marcus. “If we take care of my age bracket, that is 70 or above, I think that we can end a lot of the problems that are out there. People that are 70 or above have to be so careful because you are compromised in many different ways. But we’re only a small portion of the population, and we’re closing down everybody in addition to the schools.”

Mr. Marcus made headlines last year when he vowed to make President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign one of the beneficiaries in his life insurance policy, prompting leftist temper tantrums.

See this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this and this.

Forget the allegations by France’s oldest and second-largest newspaper that a CIA agent met with Bin Laden two months before 9/11, and the claim by a former FBI translator that Bin Laden worked with the CIA right up until 9/11.

Forget that 9/11 was entirely foreseeable, and that government more or less heard the 9/11 hijackers’ plans from their own mouths.

Forget that Dick Cheney was in charge of all counter-terrorism exercises, activities and responses on 9/11 (see this Department of State announcement, this Department of State announcement, this CNN article and this essay), and that:
• In the 70’s – Cheney and Rumsfeld were instrumental in generating fake intelligence exaggerating the Soviet threat in order to undermine coexistence between the U.S. and Soviet Union, which conveniently justified huge amounts of cold war spending (and see this)
• According to former high-level intelligence officer Melvin Goodman, Cheney orchestrated phony intelligence for the Congress in order to get an endorsement for covert arms shipments to anti-government forces in Angola
• Cheney and Rumsfeld (and many other high-level officials in the Bush Administration) were prominent members of a thinktank which called for a new American empire well before 9/11, and lamented that, without a “catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor”, transformation of America into an empire would be very slow.

Forget that governments from around the world admit that they carry out false flag terrorism to justify their political goal.

Finally, forget that the U.S. could easily have captured Bin Laden in 2001 or 2007, but chose not to do so.

Ignoring the above, it is still obvious that we’ve been had.

Specifically, only 5 hours after the 9/11 attacks, Donald Rumsfeld said “my interest is to hit Saddam”. He also said “Go massive . . . Sweep it all up. Things related and not.”

Indeed, And at 2:40 p.m. on September 11th, in a memorandum of discussions between top administration officials, several lines below the statement “judge whether good enough [to] hit S.H. [that is, Saddam Hussein] at same time”, is the statement “Hard to get a good case.” In other words, top officials knew that there wasn’t a good case that Hussein was behind 9/11, but they wanted to use the 9/11 attacks as an excuse to justify war with Iraq anyway.

Moreover, “Ten days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President Bush was told in a highly classified briefing that the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein to the [9/11] attacks and that there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda”.

And a Defense Intelligence Terrorism Summary issued in February 2002 by the United States Defense Intelligence Agency cast significant doubt on the possibility of a Saddam Hussein-al-Qaeda conspiracy.

And yet Bush, Cheney and other top administration officials claimed repeatedly for years that Saddam was behind 9/11. See this analysis. Indeed, Bush administration officials apparently swore in a lawsuit that Saddam was behind 9/11.

Moreover, President Bush’s March 18, 2003 letter to Congress authorizing the use of force against Iraq, includes the following paragraph:

Therefore, the Bush administration expressly justified the Iraq war to Congress by representing that Iraq planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attacks. See this.

Moreover, the torture program which Cheney created was specifically aimed at producing false confessions in an attempt to link Iraq and 9/11: er, the type of torture used since 9/11 was a special type of torture specifically aimed at creating false confessions:
• Humanitarian Aid Worker: Torture Only Stopped When I Pretended I Was In Al Qaeda
• Under torture, Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi claimed there was a link between Saddam Hussein, al-Qaida and WMD
• One of the Main Sources for the 9/11 Commission Report was Tortured Until He Agreed to Sign a Confession that He Was NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO READ
• 9/11 Mastermind: “During … My Interrogation I Gave A Lot Of False Information In Order To Satisfy What I Believed The Interrogators Wished To Hear”
• Self-Confessed 9/11 “Mastermind” Also Falsely Confessed to Crimes He Didn’t Commit
• Most of the 9/11 Commission Report was Based on 3rd Hand Reports of What People Said While Being Tortured

And see this.

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair says that Dick Cheney’s vision of policy towards the Middle East after 9/11 was to re-draw the map.

American historian, investigative journalist and policy analyst Gareth Porter writes in the Asia Times:

There are some bad guys out there, but their importance has been greatly exaggerated to justify America’s imperial ambitions. No wonder former U.S. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told the Senate that the war on terror is “a mythical historical narrative”.

Bin Laden might have been a bad guy … but we’ve bin had.

WASHINGTON — As the United States renews a bombing campaign against ISIS forces in Syria, it seems like America’s penchant for waging war knows no bounds. During the first seven years of Barack Obama’s presidency, the U.S. bombed seven countries while supporting other destabilizing military actions throughout the Middle East.

Here’s a look at these seven countries and the effects of bombing:
• Afghanistan — Despite the announced “end” of the Afghanistan War, significant U.S. military presence in Afghanistan remains. Drones are a frequent presence in Afghan skies. One strike earlier this month killed 12 people, according to Iran’s PressTV.
• Iraq — The Obama administration has conducted over 5,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in just the past year, David Lerman reported for Bloomberg Business. Despite ongoing U.S. military involvement, terrorism continues to be a deadly presence in Iraq’s cities.
• Libya — While the European Union and its allies carried out many of the airstrikes during Libya’s civil war, the U.S. was instrumental in destabilizing that country through both military aid and direct support, especially during the lead up to Gen. Moammar Gadhafi’s overthrow in 2011. Now ISIS is also gaining a stronghold here and the country has been described as a failed state.
• Pakistan — Drone strikes are also frequent in Pakistan, where the Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimated that only 4 percent of the victims could be identified as al-Qaida members. Although drone strikes on Pakistan began under George W. Bush, their frequency has dramatically increased under Obama, RT reported last year.
• Somalia — Over 100 U.S. troops have been stationed in Somalia since 2007, Reuters reported last year. In September, the U.S. again carried out airstrikes there, apparently killing Ahmed Abdi Godane, leader of the extremist group Al-Shabaab, which the U.S. claimed was allying with al-Qaida.
• Syria — The U.S. renewed its bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria earlier this month, with U.S. war planes taking off from bases in Turkey. Airstrikes were also used in a failed attempt to defend “Division 30,” the failed American attempt to train so-called “moderate” Syrian rebels.
• Yemen — U.S. cables revealed by WikiLeaks show that Yemeni officials have allowed airstrikes, which began under George W. Bush, to continue under the Obama administration. RT reported last year:

“US bombing raids in Yemen are almost solely carried out by drones and they have been increasing in intensity in recent years. … A report by Human Rights Watch in 2013 analyzed six airstrikes in Yemen carried out since 2009. The organization found that out of the 82 people who died in the airstrikes, 57 were civilians.

In all, the U.S. has bombed 14 predominantly Muslim countries since 1980. The death toll from all modern wars in the Middle East may be as high as 4 million dead Muslims and Arabs. Repeated military campaigns have destabilized the Middle East, giving rise to terror groups like ISIS, allowing for sectarianism to blossom, and necessitating further bombing, in what Ron Fullwood, writing for MyMPN, called a “perpetual protection racket.”"

I told myself I was done talking about this little catfish but I have to say one last thing on the matter after some friends were sleuthing around and something became apparent.

In case you missed it, on May 30th Ashton Kutcher shared Marco’s video as a story on Kutcher’s media site A Plus. By then it was starting to go viral, so it’s no surprise that Kutcher’s Buzzfeed-like website picked it up, right?

Maybe. Maybe they came across it on their own. Maybe on May 30th it was just good fortune that this previously unknown 12-year old in Mexico had someone notify him about Ashton Kutcher’s Facebook status when he was standing by with his smartphone, because that kid shared Kutcher’s post within 21 minutes of it going up. A pretty impressive social media sprint for an unknown kid, but whatever.

Levi Quackenboss asked the initial question, “Who is this kid and how did he go viral so fast,” on his site.

All the evidence points towards this nerdy, cute 12 year old self proclaimed ‘science kid’ to be nothing but a shill, signed and paid for by the corrupt pro-vaccine communities. After all it’s getting desperate times with huge declines in Vaccine uptakes across the western World and report after report of lives devastated by Vaccines."
972,True,The article discusses corruption within the pharmaceutical industry and implies that there is a deliberate effort to deceive the public about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.,True,"The article mentions the pharmaceutical industry, medical personnel, federal and state agencies, and schools as actors involved in promoting vaccines.",True,"The article discusses illegal practices, unethical behavior, and criminal activity on the part of those involved in vaccine promotion.",True,"The article suggests that the toxic ingredients in vaccines can lead to negative health outcomes, such as Autism, and ruin lives and families.",True,The article connects various events and observations to argue that the pharmaceutical industry is engaged in fraudulent practices.,True,The article implies that there is a deliberate attempt to mislead the public about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.,"The vaccine industry is under assault from various angles. It’s only a matter of time before their fraudulent “consensus science” paradigm is exposed and picked apart as false and probably even will be discouraged from being considered as a prophylactic health modality.

One of the indicators of such a developing trajectory is found in the article“Immunity and Impunity: Corruption in the State-Pharma Nexus” published by Paddy Rawlinson, Associate Professor in International Criminology, Human and Development Studies, Western Sydney University, Bankstown Campus, Bankstown NSW, Australia.

Professor Rawlinson’s article is “Open Source.” I’d like to impress how a criminologist apparently views and assesses the deceitful shenanigans of Big Pharma, their research and toxic vaccines. As most readers probably know, Australia is a ‘hotbed’ of repressive vaccine pseudoscience with deprivation of parental rights regarding informed consent, right to self-determination and mandatory children’s vaccinations.

Rawlinson opens his article stating that he examines “the corruption within the state-corporate nexus as it relates to vaccines and the pharmaindustry; that is the networks of industry, medical and political actors involved in their research, manufacturing, regulation and dissemination.”

Furthermore, he contends “The pharmaceutical industry (pharmaindustry) is no stranger to corruption.”

Wow! What a statement to make! The professor qualifies that remark by saying, “Bribery, compromised drug quality, conflict of interest, fraud and price-fixing constitute part of a litany of its illegal practices and unethical behavior, making it, historically, one of the most frequent corporate violators of the law, alongside the oil and auto industries (Braithwaite 1984; Clinard and Yeager 1980; Dukes, Braithwaite and Maloney 2014).”

Rawlinson goes on to discuss the vaccine injury compensation ‘schemes’ of the USA and the UK. However, Australia does not have a vaccine injury compensation scheme yet. Nevertheless, he says, “The very presence of such schemes confirms that vaccines carry risks, yet the rhetoric and actions of the pharmaindustry not only vilify those who point out the risks but, in some instances, respond punitively to those producing data or expressing opinions that challenge vaccine safety (Yerman 2011).”

In talking about “biopower,” Rawlinson mentions The Nuremberg Code of 1947, which established informed consent as an international norm for conducting experiments on humans. Vaccines, especially the annual influenza (flu) vaccine qualifies as a true experiment, since there are no short- nor long-term studies to prove the safety or efficacy of flu vaccines, which are nothing short of guesswork as to which influenza strains will be prominent for a coming flu season.

That’s NOT scientific nor is it ethical, in this writer’s opinion. It’s guesswork! Even talking-head MDs on radio discuss the current 2017-18 flu vaccine as not that effective. The article “This year’s flu vaccine might only be 10% effective against prominent strain” explains more about that.

Rawlinson’s article Conclusion ought to become a mantra of sorts for all lawyers and solicitors in every nation state because,

Rawlinson discusses Edward Jenner’s “unorthodox, controversial and dangerous thinking,” which apparently became the ‘bedrock’ of today’s vaccinology, in my opinion, with total disregard for how, in today’s vaccine, medical and healthcare industries, even more physiologically-dangerous ‘things’ than Jenner’s cowpox pusare being injected into infants who are less than a year old!

Such bizarre practices as injecting animal blood products, foreign DNA, aborted fetal cell lines (diploid cells), neurotoxic chemicals and metals, i.e., ethylmercury and aluminum, monkey brain cells, polysorbate 80, etc., and genetically modified/produced nanoparticulates are not considered as scientific experiments, but as ‘medical/pharmaindustry science’! Not only is that practice undocumented science, in most cases, but definitely should be considered criminal activity on the part of all involved in vaccine promotion: pharmaindustry, medical personnel who administer those toxic jabs, plus federal and state agencies—and schools, etc.—that mandate such barbaric, pseudoscientific practices. How can those toxic ‘things’ build up the human immune system? The human body and immune system, in particular, have to try to detoxify the body of such crap being syringed into it. When the body can’t detoxify them, that’s when Autism and other tragic health anomalies ruin lives and families.

As International Criminology Professor Rawlinson states in his Conclusion,

However, I would like to add, in the USA, it’s time for prosecution of all involved in the vaccine fraud industry to be prosecuted under The RICO Act.

Nothing would upset the pharmaindustry’s vaccine apple cart as effectively than some sharp U.S. lawyer filing a RICO lawsuit against some – or all – of the U.S.-based Big Pharma vaccine makers. There’s a ready-made case just waiting for him or her, so let the legal games begin. After all, lawyers make out well in class-action lawsuits against Big Pharma, don’t they?

Geoengineering must be considered weather and biological warfare due to the endless list of catastrophic downstream impacts and effects. Climate intervention programs are mathematically the greatest and most immediate threat we collectively face short of nuclear cataclysm. What can we do? How can we work together in the all important effort to expose and halt the ongoing climate engineering insanity? Sharing critical verifiable facts, coupled with shocking and compelling photo images, is the most effective method of awakening others to dire and unpleasant (but essential to face) realities. GeoengineeringWatch.org has just assembled a very comprehensive 20 page full color 6 x 9 booklet that contains the most hard hitting and undeniable climate engineering facts and photos available. This critical awareness raising tool is printed on full glossy 100lb heavy paper to make it more durable.

GeoengineeringWatch.org has made the decision to offer the new informational booklets to the public for the approximate cost of printing, handling, and shipping. Because we will have a substantial quantity printed, the cost will be exponentially lower than individuals printing their own.

The 20 Booklets and our most recent DVD package is $30, TAX INCLUDED, with FREE SHIPPING AND HANDLING, continental USA ONLY (all international shipments have additional shipping fees). This informational package has been priced as close as possible to the cost of producing, handling, and shipping it. There is only one goal, to help with the effort to sound the alarm on the critical climate engineering issue. Any remaining proceeds from the sales of this informational package will go 100% back into the ongoing effort to raise public awareness on the critical climate engineering issue. Due to our constant workload in the battle to expose and halt climate engineering, we will be mailing packages just twice a week. We apologize for the delay and thank you for your patience.

Each package includes a complementary bumper sticker, our latest version is shown below.

Activists everywhere can freely reprint the booklet and distribute this critical awareness raising tool, so long as any reproduction is not done for profit.

The individual pages for the booklet are shown below, each page can be clicked / double clicked, to enlarge to the desired size

Exposing and halting the ongoing catastrophic climate engineering assault is the great imperative of out time. This effort must be our top priority if we are to have any chance of preserving what is yet left of Earth's climate and life support systems. The 20 page fact and photo summary booklet will be an essential tool for sounding the alarm on the critical climate engineering issue.

They say the markets are ruled by fear and greed. In this case, it is simply fear that is driving the yellow metal higher day after day. There is a perfect storm of doom in the economy right now. The biggest problem is debt. It just went parabolic with the revelation that the banks are stuck with trillions of dollars in worthless mortgage backed securities. I wrote all about this Monday in a post called “Could Foreclosure Fraud Cause a Banking Calamity?” The U.S. government is going to come to the rescue and bailout the banks once again. The problem is so enormous that a government bailout will not be big enough to fix the problem, but merely put off an inevitable financial collapse. This will cause the dollar to die a not so slow death and cause massive inflation (or hyperinflation) which, in turn, will also kill the economy.

Famed gold investor Jim Sinclair has been saying for years on his website, JSMineset.com, that derivatives (including mortgage backed securities) were going to blow up someday and become worthless. It looks like that day is now here. Recently, Sinclair said, “Racketeering suits (RICO), now as civil class action suits in two states, have hit the nail on the head. The civil suit says the banks do not have proper title to the homes on which they are foreclosing. This by direct inference questions if securitized debt on mortgages have real collateral behind them. Simply stated a long time ago by Marie McDonnell and myself, THEY DO NOT. That means legacy assets are cooked, dead, and worthless, yet are now marked up in value to cost and above.”

Sinclair also says, “It is all over. Gold is going to and through $1650.” So who is buying all this gold?–The rich of course. You see, they want to stay rich and not be stuck with funny money that the government printed (out of thin air) to bail out the banks, again. A recent Reuters headline said, “Super-rich investors buy gold by ton.” The story went on to say, “The world’s wealthiest people have responded to economic worries by buying gold by the bar — and sometimes by the ton — and by moving assets out of the financial system, bankers catering to the very rich said . . .” (Click here for the complete Reuters story.)Little people (like you and me) should do what the rich do. If you cannot buy gold, then buy silver. It is a much better deal right now. Also, it was announced last week that central banks in Europe stopped selling gold. A recent CNBC story gave the reason, “The shift away from gold selling comes as European central banks reassess gold amid the financial crisis and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.” “Financial crisis”– this is a fear trade done for preservation of wealth and nothing else. (Click here to read the complete CNBC story.) Suspension of European central bank gold sales will take hundreds of tons of supply off the market and send prices higher.

You say you still just don’t understand why the rich are fearful? I just received this comment yesterday from one of my readers named Jon, who wrote, “This is the last straw for me. I am no longer paying mortgage. If others are getting off the hook, I might as well too. There is nothing to lose by acting disobedient in this system anymore. In fact, bad behavior is rewarded! I saw this loophole last year but have decided now is the time to stress-test the system. If everyone joins in the movement to get free homes, there will be too much work for the thugs to deal with. Everyone’s doing it! Jump on the bandwagon and get our country back from these evil souls who stole it.”

Now amplify Jon’s plan of action times millions of homeowners who feel the same way– cheated by the banksters. I don’t blame Jon for thinking this way, but if he and millions like him stop paying for their homes en masse, then the system will crash. The government will feel forced to step in with funny money and try and stop the banks from failing. These are the reasons why I say, “Record high gold is all about fear—not greed.”"

Yes, Jimmy Wales used proceeds from the sale of dot-com pornography to start Wikipedia. Targeting men who were looking for erotic trash online, “Bomis” was launched as a soft porn website, featuring sports cars and sleazy women as enticements, and that slowly morphed into “Nupedia,” then finally warped into the pharma-controlled fake encyclopedia we all know today as Wikipedia.

Now, it looks like Jimmy Wales’ and his fake info website business is going bankrupt – begging his naive “customers” to give him money so they can survive and pay the “volunteers” (even though they’re supposedly non-profit). Could the volunteers be pharma shills, like the sleezy “press-titutes” of the Snopes crew of fake “fact checkers?”

Still today, any layman can edit Wikipedia, and they do. Mostly biotech shills and pharma hacks bad mouth anything natural or organic, while promoting any food, medicine or vaccines that contain chemicals that cause cancer and dementia. With no scruples or ethics in place, the porno-king’s “facts” are all lies when it comes to any knowledge about self-preservation, natural healing, or longevity.

The soft-core porn-king is dying for your money

Posting as of late on anything linked to Wikipedia, comes the pleading huckster’s post for you to give him some money, even just a cup of coffee’s worth, so he can continue surviving and “thriving.” Well, if you’re thriving, why beg for $2.75 from everyone? It’s big pharma at work, folks, and if they con everyone out of $2.75, who thinks Wikipedia is real, then the billionaires get richer while the rest of us sink with the Titanic (the complete blackout of useful information on line).

Please, DO “scroll away” from fake-a-pedia, the world’s worst online dictionary of opinionated hit-pieces written by biotech shills and pharma industry hacks using weak sourcing, or simply no sourcing at all. They’re begging us all for our money so they can continue lying to us about everything that matters. Remember, Wikipedia was founded by two schmucks who ran a soft porn circuit of media and used the money to start the crook site.

DO NOT give money to Wikipedia, the online propaganda encyclopedia run by Big Pharma crooks and all those chemical-violence-supporting, pro-vaccine fanatics

If you’re looking up anything that has to do with medicine, food, or your Constitutional rights, you won’t find anything true or useful. Trust us. Natural News investigative reporters have done ample research on the writers and editors of Wikipedia, and they’re all charlatans and hucksters, who sold their souls to evil Biotech and sinister Pharma (including the highly corrupt vaccine industry) from day one, knowing good and well exactly what they were getting into. Do not give your money to vaccine pedophiles or Big Pharma crooks.

Now, the fake dictionary is hurting, and hurting bad. Even school kids know better than to try to look something up on False-a-pedia. Wicked-pedia. Peda-pedia. It’s a farce and now it looks like the porn-pirate ship is sinking, and fast. Are they going bankrupt, or will they just sell more lies to stay alive and afloat?

What these two have in common is that they belong to the highly brainwashed generation. They maybe radicals in their own right but they still retain that old mindset that what is elaborate and complicated must be effective.

What could be farther from the truth?

Tesla’s alternating current system employs fewer parts and less copper weight but it is far superior to Edison’s direct current system, proof of which is the lack of redesign attempts after more than a century from its implementation. It was perfect and beautiful then, and so it is now.

Complexity is made solely to entice everyone to consult the experts. They want us to need them, i.e. the Middlemen.

Most, if not all, of the solutions to our basic problems have simple characteristics. Cancer, in this case, can be defeated by electric pulses to the blood. This can be verified by taking a blood sample into a glass and electrify it. Do you think any parasite could ever survive?

No. But there’s no chemical antibiotics that can do the same, right?

When the blood is thoroughly cleaned from all parasites, 2000+ neuropeptides return including interferon which interferes the growth of cancer cells. The body could cure itself once these blood parasites are completely gone.

What if the cancer is not in the blood?

Well, we can try magnetic induction to introduce electric pulses to the tumor, just the same. You can build these devices through the instructions in our free eBook “Towards Healthcare Emancipation” now.

Remember, electricity doesn’t discriminate any alien organisms in the body. It neutralizes them all.

What could be more beautiful?

“But the experts said cancer, it’s not parasitic. It’s spontaneous cellular breakdown.”

Nothing is ever spontaneous. Cancer is caused either or all of the following:

Those factors are aggravated by the lack of proper nutrition, exercise and rest.

Cancer is just a degree of severity of an infection due to the above factors. When the immune system is effectively defeated, any disease becomes self-sustaining. No chemical could ever help, but only further weaken the liver and kidneys. When these critical organs are permanently damaged, the chance for survival is nil using conventional methods.

This idea comes from the employment of Common Sense, rather than reading the helpless Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine and memorizing the heavy book on Pharmacology. These mainstream books are not meant to help but further the agenda to eliminate everyone from their path to world dominion.

A former federal prosecutor said there is plenty of evidence just from open source reporting to launch an investigation of Bill and Hillary Clinton for corruption, and the Department of Justice doesn’t need a special prosecutor to do it.

In an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham Tuesday night, Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia under President Ronald Reagan, said that the department’s standard criminal division can handle looking into corruption charges against the Clintons.

Continuing, he said there was no need to trigger rules that would require the appointment of a special counsel while mocking the notion that one was required to look into alleged “collusion” between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

“There’s no factual predicate for Robert Mueller,” said diGenova, speaking of the special counsel who was appointed to look into the collusion allegations. “There’s been no crime ever announced that he is investigating.”

One of the requirements for the appointment of a special counsel is a suspicion that a federal crime has been committed, but again, as diGenova said, one was not announced when Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an early Trump supporter, recused himself from any Trump-Russia investigation.

The former prosecutor was responding to repeated calls by many congressional Republicans for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to examine various scandals that were not prosecuted during Barack Obama’s presidency, Lifezette reported.

There was the Uranium One deal, which saw a Russian company purchase up to 20 percent of U.S. uranium reserves. Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, approved the deal. There was also the odd FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was at the State Department. (FBI Director James Comey reportedly began clearing Clinton before the investigation had concluded.)

And there is plenty of concern about the Clinton Foundation’s solicitations made to foreign powers while Hillary Clinton held the U.S. secretary of state’s office.

Another Ingraham guest, Solomon Wisenberg, a lawyer who served as deputy independent counsel from 1997 to 1999 during the Whitewater investigation into then-President Clinton, was asked if he thought a special counsel was necessary since their investigations can last years and go virtually anywhere.

Wisenberg said that special counsels can be very specifically tasked, citing the investigation into the federal government’s siege of a religious compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, following the deaths of several ATF agents and compound residents in a gun battle. The siege ended with the deaths of religious leader David Koresh and scores of children when the compound caught fire after federal agents fired tear gas into one of the structures. The government was found to not be at fault, but that conclusion wasn’t reached until 2000.

DiGenova cautioned that people should not get spun up on the notion of another “special counsel” for alleged Clinton corruption because Attorney General Jeff Sessions can simply task the FBI to open a standard criminal probe. (Related: Limbaugh: Mueller’s Russia probe is really just about protecting Democrats.)

“My point is very simple,” he told Ingraham. “The Uranium One, the Clinton Foundation, all the kickback, require an investigation. There is now existing a sufficient predicate for a federal grand jury. There has been one for more than four years … I don’t give a damn who investigates it — it needs to be investigated.”

Earlier this week The National Sentinel reported that Sessions has asked senior prosecutors to examine existing evidence and report back to him whether they believe a special counsel is warranted or necessary to look into allegations against the Clintons.

In July and again in September, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., called on Sessions to appoint another special counsel to look into concerns related to the 2016 election and beyond.

“The congressman’s list of allegations was broad, but in particular he wants Sessions and the department to look into the FBI’s handling of its criminal investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server for official business, various dealings of the Clinton Foundation, and details surrounding the sale of Canadian firm Uranium One to Russian firm Rosatom,” the site reported.

Andrew Cuomo signed legislation on Thursday eliminating religious exceptions for children's vaccination requirements.

The new legislation, which the Assembly voted 77 to 53, removes exemptions from vaccinations due to religious beliefs and amends related portions of the state’s public health law.

According to recent reports, there has been an increased number of measles cases as vaccinations have decreased.

“This is a great step forward in protecting the public health here in New York,” Rockland County Executive Ed Day told reporters.

“This law should lead to a substantial increase in vaccination rates and to improved protection of our most vulnerable residents; infants, the immunocompromised, and those who have legitimate medical issues.”

According to officials, there are 259 confirmed cases of measles in New York’s Rockland County, including 566 verified cases of measles in New York City since September 2018.

Officials estimate it is the worst outbreak in 25 years, reports show.

New Yorkers reportedly support the move to end the exceptions.

According to The Daily Caller: A June 10 Siena College Research Institute poll showed 84% of citizens in the state would like to end religious exemptions to vaccinations, following the massive outbreak of measles in New York.

Measles outbreaks have popped up in other places as well.

Vaccinations rates are low for children who attended one of Google’s child care centers in Silicon Valley.

Only 49 percent of children were wholly vaccinated in one Google day care center in Santa Clara County, California, where the vaccination rate for mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) was 95 percent.

A vaccination rate of 95 percent is required to create what is called herd immunization, which makes it difficult for a disease to metastasize, according to 2015 data from California public health database.

There have been 555 cases of measles in 2019, with 21 individual cases in California, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In May, Health officials issued a warning for those planning to travel to Europe after a significant measles outbreak has now infected 34,000 people from 42 different European countries.

A large number of patients infected with the measles was noted during the first two months of 2019.

Most of the recorded cases are in Ukraine, where several people have died.

The outbreak has now extended to other countries, however, with some patients contracting the strain in the US and Asia.

They often talk about vaccine merits that heavily outweigh any risks from adverse effects that they don’t even believe actually exist. Though by now everyone should at least know there are risks to vaccinations.

A common argument used to throw people off is that polio was eradicated by vaccinating entire populations with polio vaccines. You may think for a moment that it’s a valid argument, one which you cannot counter. But that’s simply not true.

You may want to strengthen your own anti-vaccination resolve or fortify your arguments by printing and using several quotes from real physicians, scientists, and other medical professionals commenting on vaccine failure in the Vaccines Uncensored site. Most of these kinds of sites are attacked in various ways, but offer some insightful information.

The disappearance of iron lungs, those huge devices resembling miniature, individually customized decompression chambers in which polio victims were placed to help them breathe, has led most to believe the problem of polio is over. But the iron lung has merely been replaced with another, much smaller portable medical device known as the ventilator. Ventilators are used now to help those stricken with any form of breathing restrictions, whether from completely congested lungs, polio, or other paralysis that makes it impossible to breathe normally.

According to Dr. Suzanne Humphries M.D., shortly after 1955, a cover-up was created to hide the fact that the polio vaccine was even spreading polio. Dr. Humphries went on to explain how a deadly live polio virus strain had infected the Salk vaccines and created an epidemic of polio-type diseases labeled aseptic meningitis or Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP). The term AFP includes Guillain-Barre’ syndrome aka “French Polio”, traumatic neuritis, Reye’s syndrome, enteroviral encephalitis, transverse myelitis, and poliomyelitis.

Dr. Humphries displayed a graph in her article showing how reports of polio leveled out while AFP cases continually soared since the mid-1990s, demonstrating that polio has not disappeared.

Dr. Lorraine Day, who healed herself from cancer naturally, away from mainstream medicine’s harsh interventions after she was “sent home to die”, also explained that vaccines don’t work in a video interview you can view here.

After polio vaccinations had begun, polio was assigned different names to hide the vaccines’ ineffectiveness. Dr. Day asserts that 80 to 100 percent of polio cases were created by the vaccine itself. But few knew this because the name was changed to aseptic meningitis.

Polio peaked in the early 1950s and was on its way out prior to the introduction of the Salk polio vaccine.

Then came the oral polio vaccine (OPV) invented by Albert Sabin using attenuated live viruses. This was designed to create “viral shedding” from those vaccinated to those not vaccinated, thus immunizing them also.

Nice theory, but the reality was live viruses contained in OPVs tended to recombine and mutate into a fourth, more virulent wild virus polio strain. There have even been cases in the United States where parents were stricken with polio from OPV viruses while changing their vaccinated babies’ diapers.

The dangerous oral polio vaccines were eventually banned in America and other industrialized nations, but the vaccine manufacturers managed to push them off to third world countries that not only paid for them, but agreed to enforce the OPVs on their populations.

A Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation program in India was promoted as “The Last Mile: Eradicating Polio in India.” The promotional video displayed numbers showing thousands of cases of polio in India decades ago, with the number of cases dropping to 42 by 2010.

But those wild polio virus stats have been traded for vaccine induced polio cases with a different name, non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP).

Again, simply change the name of a disease and it disappears while another one appears with the same symptoms! Great for the vaccine industry’s PR campaigns to sell their junk to third world and developing nations.

In case you’re wondering why the mainstream media helps the pharmaceutical industry hide this dirt, realize the media protects the status-quo as well as its large source of advertising revenue from the pharmaceutical industry.

A professor at Harvard University has come out with a shocking prediction that as many as seven in 10 people will eventually contract the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).

Professor Marc Lipsitch says that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) “will ultimately not be containable” and that “within the coming year, some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19,” he’s quoted as saying by The Atlantic.

An expert in epidemiology, Lipsitch warns that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is especially dangerous because some of the people who become infected carriers never actually manifest any symptoms.

At the same time, not everyone who contracts the disease will die from it. Instead, “many will have mild disease, or may be asymptomatic,” Lipsitch contends.

It all depends on how effectively governments of the world are able to contain the disease before it spreads out of control. In Italy, for instance, some people are being barred from leaving their hometowns, which could help to prevent the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) from spreading to pandemic levels.

On the other hand, the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) might just be the dreaded “Disease X” that experts have been warning about for years.

“Whether it will be contained or not, this outbreak is rapidly becoming the first true pandemic challenge that fits the Disease X category, listed to the WHO’s priority list of diseases for which we need to prepare in our current globalised society,” writes Professor Marion Koopmans.

Listen below as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how Chinese people are preparing for the worst even as Americans do next to nothing to protect themselves:

Community spread of coronavirus is happening right now in America

After initially denying it, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now saying that there may, indeed, be community transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) here in the U.S., which would only make Prof. Lipsitch’s predictions more likely.

A person in California, the media is now reporting, has contracted the novel disease despite having not traveled abroad any time recently. Not only did this person not travel to China, but he or she did not travel anywhere, which means the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is probably now spreading from person to person.

“At this point, the patient’s exposure is unknown,” the CDC said in a statement. “The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and picked up by astute clinicians.”

The CDC made this announcement not long after President Trump delivered his own press briefing about the global emergency, insisting that public health containment measures and travel entry restrictions have somehow been successful in limiting the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) here on U.S. soil.

Despite President Trump’s insistence that there are only about 10 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) here in America, and that the whole thing will probably die out by the time spring arrives, there are now 60 confirmed cases of the disease in our country, including the 45 Americans who were recently repatriated from both Wuhan and the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was carrying infected travelers.

Up until this point, public health officials have been able to trace every known case of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) in the U.S. to either recent travel abroad or direct exposure to someone who recently traveled abroad. But this latest case is the first to occur outside of these parameters.

“The thing that would immediately make all of us uneasy is if this person has no direct contact with someone who comes from an affected country,” laments Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.

A political activist says 2019 is the year the New World Order crumbles

Hacktivist and internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has predicted the Deep State will be exposed with a new round of leaks coming in 2019.

The founder of file hosting service Megaupload stated that the coming year would reveal ""so much more"" regarding the deep state and the Corrupt elites.

""Get ready for the next round of leaks.""

Dotcom, who back in 2017 claimed to possess 'explosive' evidence that former DNC worker Seth Rich was the Wikileaks 'leaker,' called the Deep State ""the biggest pirates in history.""

""This year the criminals who run the Deep State will be exposed,"" adding ""The shareholders profiting from war and chaos. The billionaires who turn democracy into an illusion. They own politicians, judges and all your data. They are the biggest pirates in history. Want to know who they are?""

While leaving breadcrumbs going back to 2015 about the Wikileaks Exposé of Hillary Clinton, Dotcom also stated that DNC ""hack"" which launched the Russian election meddling narrative was completely bogus.

He Tweeted: ""Let me assure you, the DNC hack wasn't even a hack. It was an insider with a memory stick. I know this because I know who did it and why.""

Dotcom also claims he offered evidence to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, not once but twice, and never received a reply.

More than $25 million of taxpayer money was spent on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

In this year alone, between April 1 and Sept. 30, $4.56 million has been spent on the investigation.

Last month, New Zealand’s top court announced it will hear Kim Dotcom’s final appeal against extradition to the United States on fraud and online piracy charges.

Their documents, being sent by attorneys to the FBI this week, evidence industrialists are operating a crime ring within the ""Partnership for New York City"" (PNYC), and are behind the pandemic's creation, media persuasions, vaccination preparations, and health official promotions. ""David Rockefeller's trust, that engages several powerful partners on Wall Street, including media moguls Ruppert Murdock, Morton Zuckerman, Thomas Glocer, and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Jerry Speyer, are implicated in advancing global genocide,"" Dr. Horowitz wrote to FBI directors. ""This 'partnership' controls biotechnology research and development globally. Health commerce internationally is also controlled virtually entirely by this trust that also exercises near complete control over mainstream media to promote/propagandize its products and services for the drug cartel's organized crime. This trust, in essence, makes or breaks medical and natural healing markets, primarily through the mass media companies and propaganda it wields for social engineering and market building,"" Dr. Horowitz wrote. Among the revelations from the Horowitz-Kane research are those linking Larry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties, Inc., and the 9-11 terrorist attacks, to the drug cartel's geopolitical, economic, and population reduction activities. Mr. Silverstein, leaser of the World Trade Center who authorized to have Building-7 ""pulled"" [detonated] is a chief suspect in the ""9-11 truth"" investigation. Silverstein is currently landlord and co-partner in the biotechnology trust founded by David Rockefeller and implicated by these new discoveries. Given the unprecedented nature and urgency of these findings, Dr. Horowitz has posted his affidavit for public review on FLUscam.com, hoping wide spread dissemination will prompt governments worldwide to cease mass vaccination preparations to avoid becoming accessories. ""The last time I contacted the FBI I warned them about the impending anthrax attacks one week before the first mailings were announced in the press,"" Dr. Horowitz recalled. ""It took them 6 months to respond. When they did, they made me a suspect in the mailings. This time I am warning the Justice Department a month before the deadliest genocide in history. I'm praying they'll take kindly to my appeal for a PNYC investigation, and Court-ordered injunction, to stop the vaccinations for public protection."""
984,False,The article does not discuss a conspiracy theory.,True,The article mentions the Canaanites and Americans as actors.,True,"The article discusses the actions of the Canaanites and Americans, such as sacrificing children and justifying abortion.",False,The article does not mention any threats.,True,The article connects the actions of the Canaanites and Americans and highlights the similarities between them.,False,The article does not mention any secrecy.,"Recently I was studying the religion of the Canaanites, and stumbled across an interesting fact in Halley’s Bible Handbook concerning a pagan practice known as “foundation sacrifices” …

“Under the debris, in this ‘High Place,’ Macalister found great number of jars containing the remains of children who had been sacrificed to Baal. The whole area proved to be a cemetery for new-born babes. Another horrible practice was that they called ‘foundation sacrifices.’ When a house was built, a child would be sacrificed, and its body built into the wall, to bring good luck to the rest of the family. Many of these were found in Gezer. They have been found also at Megiddo, Jericho and other places.”

I couldn’t help but recognize the alarming similarities between the Canaanites and Americans today:
• None Just as the wicked Canaanites, Americans are sacrificing their children to a false god. The Canaanites sacrificed their babies to Baal (their principal god), and to Ashtoreth (Baal’s wife); whereas, American’s are sacrificing their children on the alter of convenience to the god of self.
• None Just as the Canaanites stored in jars the remains of children who had been sacrificed to Baal, so do Americans store the remains of aborted children in plastic containers 

 (and the body parts and tissues are sold).
• None Just as the Canaanites who sacrificed their children, having good intentions (i.e., to bring good luck to the rest of the family), so do Americans justify the murdering of children with good intentions (e.g., ""I'll abort this child so I can have a career and make a better life for my other children in the future""). This is the sicko mentality of many women today. Most people don’t do what they do for any particular reason. They do what they WANT to do, and then look for reasons to justify it. There is no justification for taking an innocent child's life. A child inconveniencing it's mother shouldn't be a crime punishable by death.

Abortion is a horrible sin, which God hates. Just as Abel's blood cried out to God from the ground (Genesis 4:10), so does the blood of millions of aborted children in America cry out to God from the grave. Americans are no better than the savage Canaanites. We place our own selfish will over God's Will, and our own law over God's Law. This is sin.

America's entire legal system centers around the preeminence of it's ""Supreme"" Courts. Tragically, most of those judges rule in favor of abortion, same-sex marriage, pornography, and other evils condemned by the Bible. Arguably, their ability to judge righteously is questionable. When the Highest Court of a nation sides against God, by ruling in favor of abortion and same-sex marriage, that nation is DOOMED! END"

“About a week ago, my daughter had started coughing and she was choking and turning blue. It was really terrible. She’d get in these coughing fits and couldn’t stop herself, couldn’t catch her breath. When we took our 13-month-old in, the doctor asked if she was fully vaccinated. We said, yes she’s fully vaccinated. The doctor said, well she can’t have whooping cough. It’s got to be something else – bronchitis – or she just has a virus.”1
• Medical doctor calls out mainstream media for reporting fake numbers of flu deaths in order to sell more flu vaccines

He goes on to explain that she was initially misdiagnosed because the doctor just knew since she was fully vaccinated it couldn’t be whooping cough. (My emphasis.) And yet, she did have it. Why? Because the vaccine isn’t full proof.

There really is nothing worse than watching someone you love in pain. And we wish illness on no one. Especially children. But to beg people to get vaccinated with vaccines that you yourself know don’t fully work? And to use your platform to sow fear? If I had children I wouldn’t vaccinate. And I don’t get vaccines myself after having been vaccine injured as a child. But I never sow fear. Vaccinate or don’t. Eat meat or don’t. What I want is for you to educate yourself, to have the freedom to do so, and then make the choice that best suits you and your family.

“The next day we get the call from public health because it’s a public health threat. They told us everybody who has been in touch with her has to get the antibiotic so they don’t transmit it because adults can carry it without having it. The point of all this is: get your kids vaccinated. Don’t think you’re just getting them vaccinated because it will always prevent pertussis. It won’t. My kid is fully vaccinated and it doesn’t prevent pertussis all the way. It’s 80 percent effective. But get your kid vaccinated because it’s so transmissible and it is so dangerous that even a kid who is vaccinated can have this.”2

Vaccines don’t always work and can cause serious harm, even death. And the kicker is when you are vaccinating a child, you won’t know until it’s too late.
• Special Report: The Vitamin C Treatment of Whooping Cough

If you have decided not to vaccinate and you are worried you are the only one, you aren’t. If you are concerned that there are no medical doctors who disagree with vaccines, I assure you there are.

You are not alone.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by lawmakers before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill Tuesday and was quizzed about videos that discuss Hillary Clinton ""sexually abusing and consuming the remains of children, often in satanic rituals,"" on YouTube.

During his testimony, Pichai was asked why Google-owned YouTube has videos about ""Frazzledrip"" - a theory that suggests Hillary Clinton and her staff drink the blood of young children during a Satanic ritual and wear masks made of human skin.

The ""Frazzledrip"" conspiracy theory alleges that a video exists on the Dark Web of Clinton and her former aide Huma Abedin performing the said ritual, with alleged ""screenshots"" of the video making their way onto Internet forums.

YouTube videos about ""Frazzledrip"" have been viewed millions of times, and during Pichai's questioning, Democrat Jamie Raskin jumped right in and asked if Pichai knew about the popular underground theory.

In response, Mr. Pichai said that he was ""not aware of the specifics about it.""

Raskin followed up by claiming that YouTube’s recommendation engine was highlighting videos about conspiracy theories that accuse Hillary Clinton of ""sexually abusing and consuming the remains of children, often in satanic rituals.""

Frazzledrip is related to the Pizzagate conspiracy theory which claims that the Clintons, and other high-level politicians and Hollywood elites, sexually abuse and kill children.

The Frazzledrip theory started earlier this year after claims surfaced that a snuff video featuring Hillary Clinton exists on the Dark Web.

Supposed stills from the video show ""Hillary Clinton"" and her former aide Huma Abedin supposedly lying on a table tennis table after allegedly harvesting the adrenalin glands from a child’s body.

The theory has been ""debunked"" by unreliable, left-bias ""fack-checkers"" Snopes, but has been widely ignored by the more credible fact-checking community.

Pichai acknowledged that YouTube ""needs to do better"" in refining the videos suggested to users by its recommendation engine.

Mr. Pichai was asked questions about Google's seemingly left-wing bias in its search engine results.

In response to accusations from some Republican voices, including US President Donald Trump, who has previously accused Google of ""rigging"" search results with negative news about himself and fellow Republicans, the Google boss asserted to the committee that individual employees are not able to influence the results it shows users.

Several reports have emerged recently that suggest political bias at Google, including a leaked video in which high-level executives discuss ways to ""correct"" the ""problem"" of Trump winning the US election over Hillary Clinton.

More recently, a leaked email thread showed Google employees seemingly discussing ways to suppress results from Breitbart, Drudge and The Daily Caller, claiming they are ""not legitimate news sources"" due to them not being ""close to our views.""

“How many times did you see the Election now card with items from opinion blogs (Breitbart, Daily Caller) elevated next to legitimate news organizations? That’s something that can and should be fixed,” Google engineer Scott Byer wrote.

Yet, Mr. Pichai contradicted the leaked discussions by his staff, telling Congressman Lamar Smith that ""it is not possible for an individual employee to manipulate our search results.""

Pichai didn't divulge whether it would be possible for a team of Google staffers to collaborate on a censorship campaign, however.



In a bid to understand how its search algorithms work, the Google CEO was asked why images of President Trump appear at the top of Google Images when you search the word ""idiot.""

Speaking about bias accusations later in the hearing, Congressman Ted Lieu said:

""If you want positive search results, do positive things.

""If you don’t want negative search results, don’t do negative things.""

Scrutinized about its handling of people’s data, Mr. Pichai repeated multiple times that users have the choice over how much data they share and said that 20 million people a day adjust their settings themselves.

""It’s an area we want to do better, as a company that has grown a lot it’s a complicated matter,"" he continued.

Democratic congressman Rep. Al Green (D-TX) said that President Donald Trump needed to be impeached “to deal with slavery,"" during an interview on MSNBC.

Green recently stated that Trump must be impeached or else “he will get reelected,” a narrative that is becoming increasingly common among Democrats.

Green, this week, said there is “no limit” to the number of times that Democrats can try to impeach the president.

“So, I know that you introduced one of those first impeachment resolutions against Trump, and let’s look at how that went down,” the MSNBC host said.

“It actually lost 364-58. How do you think this process ends if more evidence is revealed, and are you concerned at all that Americans are having a waning interest as this process drags on?”

“Well, it was yesterday in fact that we celebrated in a sense that we had something that was brought to the floor, maybe I shouldn’t say celebrated. Let me just say that we brought to the floor the articles for a vote, and we received some 50-plus votes and then the second time some 60 plus and a third time 95 votes,"" he said.

""So, I believe that the American people understand that this is something that we must do at this point,"" Green continued.

""I don’t speak for all of the American people, but a majority seem to think so, and I think that we’re moving forward in a very cautious and prudent way, which is what is expected, but I also think that if we don’t include some of the things that are important to people of color then I think that our business won’t be finished with.""

“I do believe, ma’am, that we have to deal with the original sin,” Green added.

“We have to deal with slavery,"" Green stated.

""Slavery was the thing that put all of what President Trump has done lately into motion. It’s insidious … racism, the president has played on racism, and he’s used that as a weapon to galvanize a base of support to mobilize people.”

“We cannot overlook what happened when he came down the escalator and just demeaned people of color when he talked about the s-hole countries,” Green continued.

“He has found a way to use ugly words to his benefit and to the detriment of the people who are the object of his words. Emily Dickinson said a word is dead when it is said, some say, I say, it just begins to live that day.""

""His words take on life and meaning, and they hurt, and I know the people who are being hurt, and I came to Congress to represent them, and I cannot let it go,"" he added.

""So, I appreciate whatever we will do, but until we deal with the issue of invidious discrimination as a relates to [the] LGBTQ community, the anti-semitism , the racism, the Islamophobia, the transphobia, and also the misogyny that he has exemplified, I don’t think our work is done.”

On Friday, Green complained that the expert witnesses didn't include a ""person of color.""

The Democrat slammed his colleagues over their selection of experts called to testify against Trump during the impeachment inquiry.

Rep. Green scolded his fellow Democrats in a speech on the House floor.

During the impeachment inquiry hearing, three legal scholars were called to give testimony at the request of Democrats.

""It hurts my heart, Mr. Speaker, to see the Judiciary Committee hearing experts on the topic of impeachment — one of the seminal issues of this Congress — hearing experts... and not one person of color among the experts,"" Rep. Green said.

Yet, if you talk to the average person today about the New World Order, they laugh in your face and label you as a nut case. Sadly, this includes many professed Christian believers. Oh, how Satan has blinded the eyes of men from the truth because they do not love the truth. 2nd Thessalonians 2:9,10, ""Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."" Have you received the “love of the truth?” Few people these days love the truth. Most people are glued to their TV and are against God.

Pope Benedict, in his first Christmas address, on Sunday urged humanity to unite against terrorism, poverty and environmental blight and called for a ""new world order"" to correct economic imbalances.

The Pope made his comments to tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered under umbrellas in a rainy St Peter square for his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message and blessing.

In his address, telecast live from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica to tens of millions of people in nearly 40 countries, he also urged his listeners not to let technological achievements blind them to true human values.

He said humanity should look to the Christ child for encouragement in times of difficulty and fear.

""A united humanity will be able to confront the many troubling problems of the present time: from the menace of terrorism to the humiliating poverty in which millions of human beings live, from the proliferation of weapons to the pandemics and the environmental destruction which threatens the future of our planet,"" he said.

""Do not fear; put your trust in him! The life-giving power of his light is an incentive for building a new world order based on just ethical and economic relationships,"" he said, speaking in Italian.

The address by the leader of the world's some 1.1 billion Roman Catholics was different in style than those of his predecessor John Paul, who died last April.

John Paul wrote his Christmas addresses in free-style verse and resembled poetry, whereas Benedict's was in prose like a normal homily or speech.

Since his election, the Pope has repeatedly reminded Catholics not to give in to an ""ethical relativism"" where circumstances can be used to justify actions that should be considered wrong in all cases.

The Pope, wearing a gold cape and with a gold mitre, continued in that line on Sunday by beaming in on the dangers of technology and progress, implying that it should not be allowed to become tantamount to a God in its own right.

""Today we can dispose of vast material resources. But the men and women in our technological age risk becoming victims of their own intellectual and technical achievements, ending up in spiritual barrenness and emptiness of heart,"" he said.

""That is why it is so important for us to open our minds and hearts to the birth of Christ, this event of salvation which can give new hope to the life of each human being,"" he said.

In other parts of the address he appealed for respect for the rights of people suffering a humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan.

He made another appeal for peace in the Holy Land and called for ""actions inspired by fairness and wisdom"" in Iraq and Lebanon.

The Pope asked God to favour dialogue on the Korean peninsula so that ""dangerous disputes"" there and elsewhere in Asia can be solved peacefully.

The Urbi et Orbi followed a solemn Christmas eve midnight mass attended by a congregation that packed St Peter's Basilica.

In his homily at that mass he urged the world's Catholics to be beacons of peace in a troubled world and offered a special prayer for an end to strife in the Holy Land.

The next major event on the Pope's Christmas season calendar is a mass on the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6. Two days later he will baptise children.

In early January, the Pope is due to publish his first encyclical, a major writing addressed to all Church members.

The encyclical, believed to be called ""God is Love"", deals with the individual's personal relationship with God."

The Justice Department is moving toward bringing a case as soon as this summer, some of the people said. At least some state attorneys general—led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican—are likely to file a case, probably in the fall, people familiar with the matter said. Much of the states’ investigation has focused on Google’s online advertising business. The company owns the dominant tool at every link in the complex chain between online publishers and advertisers. The Justice Department likewise is making Google’s ad technology one of its points of emphasis. But it is also focusing more broadly on concerns that Google uses its dominant search business to stifle competition, people familiar with the matter said. Though the coronavirus pandemic has complicated work for the Justice Department, Attorney General William Barr has devoted considerable resources to the Google probe and continues to treat it as a top priority. Mr. Barr told The Wall Street Journal in March that he wanted the Justice Department to make a final call this summer.

Google controls 80% of search. That means it controls what the internet looks like. And it’s continuing to erase conservatives from the internet. I’m just the latest victim. Its censorship and creepy surveillance have reached new heights during the pandemic.

It needs to be stopped.

Google is extremely vulnerable to anti-trust litigation on paper. The DOJ is going after DoubleClick, the root of its ad business, which is also the root of its violations. But Google is also a massively wealthy company and has deep networks and pockets. And the DOJ track record for bringing Big Tech to heel over these matters is very poor over the decades. This will be a major test.

Red state AG’s and the DOJ are going to try and hit Google with both barrels. Win or lose, it’ll be a long struggle.

But the future of free speech is at stake."

I've been exposing TobyMac as a Christian fraud for many years. The album cover to the left is Toby's new and latest album which just came out on August 28, 2012. Look at the All Seeing Eye. This latest album further evidences who Toby McKeehan serves, that is, Satan!

Sadly, most young people today don't care. They are knowingly following the New World Order, selling their souls to the Devil. You can hear a short clip of Toby's new album and song, EYE ON IT at Amazon. Please read, New World Order Occult Images In CCM Music! You either want to know THE TRUTH or you don't. It is obvious that Satan is behind the music industry (and that certainly includes CCM). Toby McKeehan (born 1964) is now 47 years old in 2012.

The Bible teaches in 2nd Thessalonians 2:10 that the masses of this world will openly receive the Antichrist when he comes, being taken “with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.”

Wow, what an amazing Scripture! This truth is profound. Have you ever heard the old country song which says, “You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything.” Well my friend, if you don't embrace the truth of THE GOSPEL of the Lord Jesus Christ, then you are open game for the Devil to hunt down and kill. Literally, the Bible is teaching that those who don't embrace the truth of the Word of God, will instead be deceived by the Devil.

We already see this truth evidenced today in the world. Most Jews REJECT the Messiah, Jesus Christ. And so instead they are all waiting within the Judaism false religion for another messiah, the Devil's messiah, and he will be the Antichrist.

Also, the Shiite Muslims REJECT Jesus as the Messiah and are waiting for an Islamic messiah, called al-Mahdi, who will lead Islam to its rightful place as the dominant religion in the world. Their messiah will be the Antichrist when he comes. Do you see what the Devil is doing? Satan has taught all of his false religions to expect the Antichrist in the form of a messiah; but it's not the Messiah as prophesied in the Bible. The world will worship the man of sin when he comes, that is, the Antichrist. They will be required to worship his image and receive a mark in their forehead and right-hand, or else be killed (Revelation 13:15-17)."

Right now across the globe, people are stuck at home and unable to do things they would normally do, right?

As nice as it would be to get back to normal, things are not as simple as we might wish they were. A recent study published in the Lancet actually seems to say that the lockdowns we are under should not be lifted until we have a vaccine for the virus itself. This study comes forth based on information gathered during China’s outbreak. It is titled ‘First-wave COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modeling impact assessment.’

Now, within this study it using math and models seems to come to the understanding that lifting these measures we have in place too early could cause a second wave of infections to be born. This throwing the affected area back into the same disaster it had previously fought.

The method and findings of this study go as follows according to the posted abstract:

We estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces. We used a susceptible–infectious–recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave.

In all selected cities and provinces, the Rt decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·73–6·09). Relaxing the interventions (resulting in Rt >1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level.

This meaning that while the first wave has been abated, there are risks present for a ‘viral reintroduction.’ That in itself likely potentially stemming from things like importation or so the study suggests. Basically restrictions need to be lifted slowly and monitored very closely.

CNN wrote as follows when covering this topic:

The effects of lifting a lockdown too early could hit some areas harder than others. Further analysis in the Lancet report showed that the risk of death for those who tested positive for Covid-19 varied substantially in different parts of China, based on economic development and availability of health care resources.

The death rate in Hubei was 5.91%, almost six times higher than outside the province, where it was 0.98%, the study found.

“Even in the most prosperous and well-resourced megacities like Beijing and Shanghai, health care resources are finite, and services will struggle with a sudden increase in demand,” senior author Professor Gabriel M Leung from the University of Hong Kong, said in the release accompanying the Lancet report. “Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring that local health-care systems have adequate staffing and resources to minimize Covid-related deaths.”

Strict restrictions on the movement of people and goods were introduced across China on January 23 after the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan in December, drastically affecting the economy as well as personal freedoms. These have since been progressively relaxed in some Chinese provinces, with factories and offices gradually reopening.

The analysis of four cities and 10 provinces outside Hubei states that measures should be lifted gradually or the number of cases will progressively rise over the relaxation period.

The estimates also suggest that once the burden of rising cases is elevated, simply tightening interventions again would not reduce the burden back to its original level. This would require extra effort, likely resulting in bigger health and economic effects.

“We are acutely aware that as economic activity increases across China in the coming weeks, local or imported infection could lead to a resurgence of transmission,” co-lead author Dr. Kathy Leung from the University of Hong Kong, added in the release. “Real-time monitoring of the effect of increased mobility and social mixing on Covid-19 transmissibility could allow policymakers to fine tune control measures to interrupt transmission and minimize the impact of a possible second wave of infections.”

While the idea of being on some kind of lockdown until a vaccine is found and pushed through sounds crazy, it could be necessary depending on how things play out and how research ends up proving through. We are all getting tired of being stuck at home but should still do our best to remain abiding by guidelines for the sake of ourselves and others. Remaining as up to date as possible right now is important. \"

Actor Robert Redford has gone on another op-ed rant against President Donald Trump, accusing our Commander-in-Chief of being “dictator-like” and running a “monarchy in disguise.”

Writing for NBC News‘ “THINK,” the 83-year-old filmmaker lamented how he supposedly gave Trump a chance, but that Trump ultimately failed and now needs to be removed from office.

“We’re up against a crisis I never thought I’d see in my lifetime: a dictator-like attack by President Donald Trump on everything this country stands for,” Redford wrote, failing to reveal precisely what “everything this country stands for” actually means.

“It’s time for Trump to go – along with those in Congress who have chosen party loyalty over their oath to ‘solemnly affirm’ their support for the Constitution of the United States,” he added. “And it’s up to us to make that happen, through the power of our votes.”

Though Trump was not Redford’s “choice” for president, the legacy entertainment icon claims he “thought it only fair to give the guy a chance.” But Trump hasn’t met Redford’s expectations, so it’s time for him to be impeached, apparently.

“… almost instantly [Trump] began to disappoint and then alarm me,” Redford whined in his editorial. “I don’t think I’m alone.”

“What is happening, right now, is so deeply disturbing that instead of the United States of America, we are now defined as the Divided States of America,” Redford further claims, blaming all of this country’s current woes not on the lying mainstream media, but squarely on Trump.

“Leaders on both sides lack the fundamental courage to cross political aisles on behalf of what is good for the American people.”

Redford went on to liken Trump to the usual suspects, including Adolph Hitler, Richard Nixon, and Osama Bin Laden.

Back in April, Redford wrote an earlier op-ed for TIME that was even more hysterical. At the time, Redford claimed that it was pointless to try to impeach Trump because, unless Trump decided to accept the theory of man-made climate change, then there “will be no planet to live on” anyway.

Trump is just like Hitler, declare loud women at The View

Not to be outdone, the cackling hags from The View recently went on their own rant against Trump, also likening him to Hitler.

Upset that Facebook didn’t remove the Trump campaign’s social media advertising, Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar accused Zuckerberg of kowtowing to a dictator, adding that if Facebook were around during World War II, the platform would have given Hitler his own fan page.

“I think Facebook would give Hitler his own fan page … just like all the networks gave air time to Trump before they knew what a bad idea he was,” Behar squealed in disgust.

“Now we know what a bad idea he is, and we know what a bad idea Hitler was, and black racism and anti-Semitism,” she added, throwing in the words “black racism and anti-Semitism” at the end for added dramatic effect.

In Behar’s view, “now is the time to correct the situation” by impeaching Trump, and probably Mike Pence as well, and replacing them with Nancy Pelosi and whomever she might choose as her running mate, presumably during one of her many drunken stupors.

“This is global propaganda,” Behar declared, lamenting the fact that Trump’s messaging and advertising isn’t confined to just the United States.

“Everyone in every part of the world hears this stuff. Then, I just realized he said they micro-target the fans. So white nationalists can just increase their numbers all over the place,” Behar went on to state in her typical shrill voice, insinuating that all Trump supporters are Nazis."

8The result? For starters, some 3 million followers of teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg have been reading posts written by her father, Svante Thunberg, and a climate activist in India who serves as a delegate at the UN’s Climate Change organization, Adarsh Prathap. Thunberg, Inc. claims Greta is still the one writing the content.

Greta, Inc. explained this in a Saturday Facebook post purporting to be the young climate activist.

“Some people have been asking who manages this page. First of all, since last spring I only use Facebook to repost what I write on my Twitter and Instagram accounts,” reads the post, in which ‘she’ says she tried Facebook “early on,” but didn’t like it, so she uses “my father Svantes account to repost content.”

“The rest that is shared on Facebook is reposted from Twitter and Instagram by the guy who founded the Greta Thunberg Facebook page long before I knew it existed. His name is Adarsh Prathap and he lives in India. Since a lot of people thought it was my official page in the beginning I asked if I could co-manage it and he said yes.“

Greta claims to have written all the content posted by her father and Prathap.

In other words, “of course it’s not me silly – you should have known I just ‘co-manage’ the fan page.”

Except – by all outward appearances it appeared to be her page alone.

Facebook’s ‘page transparency’ shows Greta as the confirmed owner – with the only clue suggesting she might have help being a page manager located in India.

According to Facebook, the flaw was quickly fixed – but not before the people behind famous accounts were revealed and shared on public forums such as 4chan.

“We quickly fixed an issue where someone could see who edited or published a post on behalf of a Page when looking at its edit history,” said the company in a statement. “We are grateful to the security researcher who alerted us to this issue.”

Facebook says the bug was the result of a code update that it pushed Thursday evening. It’s not something most people would have encountered on their own, since it took navigating to a Page, viewing an edit history, and realizing that there shouldn’t be a name and profile picture assigned to edits to exploit it. Still, despite the Friday morning fix, screenshots circulated on 4chan, Imgur, and social media appearing to show the accounts behind the official Facebook Pages of the pseudonymous artist Banksy, Russian president Vladimir Putin, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, the hacking collective Anonymous, climate activist Greta Thunberg, and rapper Snoop Dogg, among others. Facebook points out that no information beyond a name and public profile link were available, but that information isn’t supposed to appear in the edit history at all. And for people, say, running anti-regime Pages under a repressive government, making even that much information public is plenty alarming. –Wired

“People who run sensitive Pages from their own Facebook should now consider that their identity may be known,” said Lukasz Olejnik independent privacy adviser and Oxford University Center for Technology and Global Affairs. “While mistakes happen, this one is unexpected.”"

After three weeks' bombing, not a single terrorist implicated in the attacks on America has been caught or killed in Afghanistan. Instead, one of the poorest, most stricken nations has been terrorised by the most powerful - to the point where American pilots have run out of dubious ""military"" targets and are now destroying mud houses, a hospital, Red Cross warehouses, lorries carrying refugees. Unlike the relentless pictures from New York, we are seeing almost nothing of this. Tony Blair has yet to tell us what the violent death of children - seven in one family - has to do with Osama bin Laden.

And why are cluster bombs being used? The British public should know about these bombs, which the RAF also uses. They spray hundreds of bomblets that have only one purpose; to kill and maim people. Those that do not explode lie on the ground like landmines, waiting for people to step on them. If ever a weapon was designed specifically for acts of terrorism, this is it. I have seen the victims of American cluster weapons in other countries,such as the Laotian toddler who picked one up and had her right leg andface blown off. Be assured this is now happening in Afghanistan, in your name. None of those directly involved in the September 11 atrocity was Afghani. Most were Saudis, who apparently did their planning and training in Germany and the United States. The camps which the Taliban allowed bin Laden to use were emptied weeks ago.

Moreover, the Taliban itself is a creation of the Americans and the British. In the 1980s, the tribal army that produced them was funded by the CIA and trained by the SAS to fight the Russians. The hypocrisy does not stop there. When the Taliban took Kabul in 1996, Washington said nothing. Why? Because Taliban leaders were soon on their way to Houston, Texas, to be entertained by executives of the oil company, Unocal. With secret US government approval, the company offered them a generous cut of the profits of the oil and gas pumped through a pipeline that the Americans wanted to build from Soviet central Asia through Afghanistan. A US diplomat said: ""The Taliban will probably develop like the Saudis did."" He explained that Afghanistan would become an American oil colony, there would be huge profits for the West, no democracy and the legal persecution of women. ""We can live with that,"" he said. Although the deal fell through, it remains an urgent priority of the administration of George W. Bush, which is steeped in the oil industry.

Bush's concealed agenda is to exploit the oil and gas reserves in the Caspian basin, the greatest source of untapped fossil fuel on earth and enough, according to one estimate, to meet America's voracious energy needs for a generation. Only if the pipeline runs through Afghanistan can the Americans hope to control it. So, not surprisingly, US Secretary of State Colin Powell is now referring to ""moderate"" Taliban, who will join an American-sponsored ""loose federation"" to run Afghanistan. The ""war on terrorism"" is a cover for this: a means of achieving American strategic aims that lie behind the flag-waving facade of great power. The Royal Marines, who will do the real dirty work, will be little more than mercenaries for Washington's imperial ambitions, not to mention the extraordinary pretensions of Blair himself.

Having made Britain a target for terrorism with his bellicose ""shoulder to shoulder"" with Bush nonsense, he is now prepared to send troops to a battlefield where the goals are so uncertain that even the Chief of the Defence Staff says the conflict ""could last 50 years"". The irresponsibility of this is breathtaking; the pressure on Pakistan alone could ignite an unprecedented crisis across the Indian sub-continent. Having reported many wars, I am always struck by the absurdity of effete politicians eager to wave farewell to young soldiers, but who themselves would not say boo to a Taliban goose.

There are signs that Washington is about to extend its current ""war"" to Iraq; yet unknown to most of us, almost every day RAF and American aircraft already bomb Iraq. There are no headlines. There is nothing on the TV news. This terror is the longest-running Anglo-American bombing campaign since World War Two. The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and Britain faced a ""dilemma"" in Iraq, because ""few targets remain"". ""We're down to the last outhouse,"" said a US official. That was two years ago, and they're still bombing.

The cost to the British taxpayer? £800 million so far. According to an internal UN report, covering a five-month period, 41 per cent of the casualties are civilians. In northern Iraq, I met a woman whose husband and four children were among the deaths listed in the report. He was a shepherd, who was tending his sheep with his elderly father and his children when two planes attacked them, each making a sweep. It was an open valley; there were no military targets nearby. ""I want to see the pilot who did this,"" said the widow at the graveside of her entire family. For them, there was no service in St Paul's Cathedral with the Queen in attendance; no rock concert with Paul McCartney.

There is no war on terrorism. If there was, the Royal Marines and the SAS would be storming the beaches of Florida, where more CIA-funded terrorists, ex-Latin American dictators and torturers, are given refuge than anywhere on earth. There is, however, a continuing war of the powerful against the powerless, with new excuses, new hidden agendas, new lies.

Leftist MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace suggested the devastation that the deadly coronavirus has caused has a ""silver lining"" because it will damage President Donald Trump.



Wallace said that Trump's ""first three years catch up with him"" during a panel discussion, causing him of lying and contradicting scientists.

""There is something both tragic, and pathetic, and ironic about the fact that it took a, you know, color-blind, gender-blind, you know, state-line-blind virus to sort of have all of the president’s sins from his first three years catch up with him,"" Wallace said.

""You can’t stand there and lie. You can’t contradict your scientists because they’re the ones that stand at 66 and 68 percent public trust, not you.""

""He’s down at 38 percent. Pence is lower than him.""

""I mean, he needs those people whether he likes what they say or not and I wonder what you think about whether or not there’s some silver lining there, that some of the things that, that we’ve been talking about for three years may be finally catching up with him?""

Former Ebola czar under Obama, Ron Klain, saying a leader would ""tell the American people the truth.""

He then went on to tout Obama's supposed honesty of ""bad news"" that was ahead during the Ebola outbreak.

""When President Trump stands up yesterday and says 'There will not be a second wave,' he is denying the inevitable,"" Klain said.

""If you look at the history of epidemics, there's always a second wave and a third wave,"" he added.

""The idea that there's a smooth curve up and a smooth curve down is wrong.""

""And so when the disease comes back this fall, will President Trump try to tell us again, 'No one saw it coming, who could have possibly foreseen that?"" he asked.

""That argument, which is a false argument now, is going to look like a ridiculous argument in the fall when he stood in the briefing room and tried to spar with his own health officials about the scientific indefinability that this virus will be back.""

Anti Trump MSNBC faced fire from the White House last month for cutting away from the Trump administration's daily coronavirus task force briefing.

The actions of the news outlets were described as ""disgraceful"" by the White House.

""Pretty disgraceful that @CNN and @MSNBC have both cut away from this @WhiteHouse briefing with @realDonaldTrump and @Mike_Pence during a global pandemic. Thank you to @FoxNews for keeping Americans informed. #COVID19.""

Earlier this month, MSNBC praised China for its response to the coronavirus, COVID-19 outbreak, essentially parroting the communist nation's propaganda.

Host Rachel Maddow, unquestionably drank the communist Chinese government's 'official' statistics on deaths from the virus, despite skepticism from many experts and even the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned of the country's propaganda."

But a recent federal case involving the U.S.Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has revealed that, contrary to this widely-held belief, thimerosal is actually still present in many batch vaccines, including in the annual influenza vaccine that is now administered to children as young as six months old.

Filed by a citizen-backed coalition advocating vaccine safety, the lawsuit against the FDA alleged that the agency’s continued endorsement and approval of thimerosal as a vaccine additive is a serious public health threat, especially since safer alternatives already exist and are widely used voluntarily by many vaccine manufacturers. But Judge Brett Kavanaugh, siding with antiquated pseudoscience, decided that thimerosal is not a health threat, and that those who wish to avoid it can simply choose thimerosal-free alternatives.

Ignoring the evidence of thimerosal’s dangers brought before him on behalf of the millions of children across the country who continue to be injected with this mercury-based additive, Judge Kavanaugh declared that the plaintiffs, which include groups like theCoalition for Mercury-Free Drugs(CMFD), did not have proper standing to file the lawsuit. And in the process, both he and the FDA inadvertently admitted that thimerosal is still present in many childhood vaccines, which counters popular claims to the contrary.

FDA admits on its website that thimerosal is still in vaccines

The fact that Judge Kavanaugh refused to hear the case is tragic in and of itself, as thimerosal, which is composed of 50 percent mercury, has been proven to cause serious health damage. But what may be even worse is the fact that many people falsely believe that thimerosal is not even included in vaccines anymore, which is leading them to blindly allow them to be administered to their children. And the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA have continued to provide dubious and misleading information on the subject, which the mainstream media has been complicit in spreading over the years.

But the FDA explains, in no uncertain terms, directly on its website that thimerosal is still added to certain vaccines. For this reason alone, it is crucial that parents who choose to vaccinate their children ask for an ingredients list for each and every vaccine before allowing them to be administered to their children.

“While the use of mercury-containing preservatives has declined in recent years with the development of new products formulated with alternative or no preservatives, thimerosal has been used in some immune globulin preparations, anti-venins, skin test antigens, and ophthalmic and nasal products, in addition to certain vaccines,” writes the FDA on its Thimerosal in Vaccinespage (http://www.fda.gov).

Don’t believe the lie: Thimerosal is eventually converted by the body into highly-toxic inorganic mercury

Another myth often spread by thimerosal advocates claims that the ethylmercury compounds that compose roughly 50 percent of the preservative are not actually harmful because they are different from the type found in a can of tuna. But a comprehensive review conducted by Dr. Paul G. King has proven otherwise, showing that ethylmercury is first metabolized by the body into toxic methylmercury, which is then metabolized into inorganic mercury.

Both methylmercury and inorganic mercury are listed by the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) as toxic substances responsible for causing neurological problems, brain disorders, nervous system illnesses, gastrointestinal problems, kidney failure, respiratory illness, and death."

A whole slew of tech giants, drug companies, big box retailers, and fast food chains grabbed headlines in 2019 for bending over backwards in proud support of deranged leftists and their many special interests, causes and agendas – and we’d like to highlight these entities below in order to publicly shame them.

The following is a recap of the worst “politically correct” offenders this past year, all of which deserve a dishonorable mention for the respective roles they played in silencing free speech, indoctrinating children into sexual filth, manipulating government agencies and officials, and all-around promoting evil and the continued downfall of our once great nation.

Google, YouTube and Ascension: An unholy trifecta of surveillance and privacy invasion

Arguably the worst offender of all is Google, which committed so many crimes against humanity in 2019 that it’s difficult to list them all. Early on in the year, it was reported that Google secretly records the private conversations of Android users without their permission or consent.

It was also revealed that Google has partnered up with communist China to construct an artificial intelligence (AI) control grid, complete with auto-blacklisting and auto-demonetization of those deemed enemies of the state.

More recently, Google also partnered up with a company known as Ascension to implement an Orwellian scheme known as “Project Nightingale” that involves sweeping up the private health records of millions of Americans.

This is in addition to all of the political censorship, search results manipulation, shadow-banning, and other anti-First Amendment policies that Google has implemented all throughout the year 2019 in anticipation of the 2020 presidential election.

Apple loves transgenders, hates Christians, and rejects all forms of climate skepticism

One of Google’s runners-up, Apple similarly cracked down on free speech in 2019, banning Natural News and other independent news outlets from its Apple News service on the grounds that their climate articles contain information that’s “rejected by the scientific community.”

When it’s not worshiping at the feet of transgenders and targeting Christians and others who oppose the transgender indoctrination of children, Apple is catering to pedophiles and child pornographers, whose egregious online activities apparently don’t violate Apple’s “terms of service.”

Twitter thought it would be a great idea to hire a psy-op government agent and propagandist to police people’s tweets

Now, to the uninformed amongst you, that opening statement must sound like one of those ‘crazy conspiracy theories’ that the British government has just mobilised the military to discredit. Yes, in peacetime, our politicians have unbelievably—and quite treasonously—mobilised the British Army (in the guise of the new and sinister-sounding ‘Influence and Outreach’ 77 Brigade) to stop us, the ordinary people, from searching the Internet to seek out the truth about COVID-19 and what is really happening to allow our economy to be trashed beyond all recognition.

This desperation by the government to win the on-line digital propaganda war, thus preventing what they see as ‘dangerous’ disinformation and misinformation from ever becoming mainstream, clearly shows just how worried they really are. Indeed, to realise this, you’ve only got to see their panic in attempting to prevent people from seeing the apparent connections that exist between Coronavirus and the rapidly increasing roll-out of 5G.

And they should be worried! They are not only defending the completely indefensible as regards the encroaching and invasive microwave surveillance technologies that can actually do great harm to people and wildlife, but they are also protecting the ‘big secret’ involving the banking and financial world which must never be allowed to be widely known and understood by the general public… because if it was, we would know that there was absolutely no reason at all to now endanger and trash the economy and people’s livelihoods.

The bottom line is this—across the completely contrived and divisive political spectrum, our politicians at the highest level are serving and promoting a planned global agenda (called UN Agenda 2030) that’s been drawn up by a network of outright criminals and psychopaths. If you now believe that this article has definitely strayed into the territory of ‘conspiracy theories’, start researching these organisations, where powerful and influential politicians, media moguls, bankers and industrialists all meet in complete secrecy, without any accountability whatsoever to their electorates or shareholders. We’ve got the Committee of 300, the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Pilgrim Society and the Club of Rome to name but just a few.

These highly secretive and unaccountable transnational ‘think tanks’, with their evasive and system-protecting ‘Chatham House Rules’, exist only to advance an appalling global agenda which, if widely known, would be immediately rejected by the human race as a whole without any hesitation whatsoever! And if you still have your doubts, then just remember what any good police constable will tell you—always ask ‘cui bono’? (who benefits?) and always follow the money trail… and that is precisely what we’re about to do!

Unfortunately, however, these deep state globalists, by harnessing that age-old strategy of ‘divide and rule’, and by relying on our collective and quite appalling ignorance, apathy and stupidity, not to mention our ability to be easily distracted by completely mindless and meaningless trivia, are winning the information war. Of course, that’s hardly surprising considering they own and control nearly all of the mainstream media, not to mention the likes of Google, Facebook, YouTube and other digital information outlets.
